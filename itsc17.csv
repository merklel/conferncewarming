A microscopic driver model for VSL traffic previously developed by the authors is implemented in VISSIM's API module and simulation is controlled via a MATLAB COM interface. Results indicate an inverse relationship between safety and mobility performance, forcing jurisdictions designing VSL systems to either conduct multi-objective optimization or set a dominant policy objective (safety versus mobility).

For traffic as well, the number of the traffic accidents caused by senior driver is increasing year by year. One of the reason is, number of the senior drivers who have cognitive impairment getting increasing because of length life-span. Currently, Japanese government moved into actions for example to have the campaign for returning of the senior drivers' licenses, or oblige senior driver who doesn't want to return his/her license to take a driving lessons at the driving school each 3 years. But to resolve this problem, society have to take a radically-new way to support senior drivers they can drive much more safely. It would be help for the senior people to keep healthy life. We thought, if we can find the driver who seems to have cognitive impairment, we should provide some advice and prevention training to retard progression. For this motivation, we consider the way to estimate drivers' cognition level from driving behavior. In this paper, we created estimation model to estimate cognition level. We analyzed and compared 654 senior drivers' driving data and cognition test result for the estimation. From driving data, mainly we extract 3 parameters which have significant difference between unimpaired senior driver and slightly impaired. Estimation was performed by RUS-Boost and study data were the 3 parameters. The estimation result was 77.2%. It seemed good result to recognize. It shows, there is possibility to estimate driver's cognition level by driving behavior then if impaired driver is found, some support can be adopted in early stage. It would become important strategy to make health longer and keep safely senior drivers' driving.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317614","Aging Society;Senior Driver;Traffic Accident;Cognitive Impairment","Vehicles;Multitasking;Aging;Life estimation;Licenses;Task analysis","cognition;driver information systems;road accidents;road safety;road traffic","cognitive level estimation;cognition test;driving school;traffic accidents;Japan;impaired driver;unimpaired senior driver;cognition level;driving behavior;senior people;driving lessons;cognitive impairment","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a drift compensation method for Mono VO by leveraging publicly available road sign database. In the first process of the proposed algorithm, it estimates the relative position of the camera on a vehicle with respect to the road sign using an online database that provides the positions and dimensions of the corresponding road signs. Then, the estimated positions are integrated in the Mono VO pipeline to update the current positions to compensate the accumulated drift. Unlike the previous research, the proposed solution neither uses a post-processing of optimization nor requires a loop closure, not to mention that the required database are easily available on online. Experiments are conducted to compare the proposed method with a Mono VO algorithm and results showed that the relative position drift is bounded within 0.5% for a 3km trajectory.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317705","","Roads;Cameras;Trajectory;Databases;Visual odometry;Pose estimation;Pipelines","distance measurement;mobile robots;motion estimation;navigation;object detection;optimisation;path planning;road vehicles;robot vision;traffic engineering computing","accumulated drift;Mono VO algorithm;relative position drift;mono-visual odometry;road direction sign database;ego-motion;mobile platform;relative motions;image frames;long-range navigation;drift compensation method;online database;size 3.0 km","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We experiment the scenarios as the vehicle and pedestrians in front, as well as the pedestrian crossing the street. The multiple tracks are achieved based on the Kalman filter. This work implements the state prediction model to compensate the missing targets, and the false positives are excluded through a threshold of bad tracks. To identify the potential obstacles, we impose two boundaries, i.e., lane and dynamic boundaries as the region of interest on the multiple tracks. It is demonstrated that the dynamic boundary benefits the finding of high risk obstacles and excludes most of the background noises. The lane boundary takes the advantage of tracking objects along the driving path: however, it could underestimate the risk of transverse moving objects in which the tracks are not continuous crossing the lanes.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317677","","Radar tracking;Target tracking;Sensors;Kalman filters;Vehicle dynamics;Radar detection","driver information systems;Kalman filters;object detection;radar detection;radar receivers;radar tracking","advanced driver assistance systems;perceptive sensors;Kalman filter;Kalman tracking","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Probe vehicle data are one of the most widely used passive datasets that can potentially observe wide ranges in the network, as they do not require fixed sensors. Such datasets potentially observe various phenomena which are caused by various reasons. However, it is not easy to detect significant incidents from such phenomenon due to the multi-dimensional form of the dataset and the large size required to scan the entire dataset. Incident detection is one of the significant approaches for monitoring of traffic flow and data cleansing to acquire “typical traffic situation” for analysis of measures and calibrations of models. Several previous studies have attempted to determine the local changes in the traffic flow. However, a few studies investigated a method to explore the significant incidents influencing wide-ranges of the spatio-temporal dimension which are possibly caused by the changes on either or both the service and demand side. This study proposes a data mining method to detect unusual situations in large-scale road network from a large volume of probe vehicle dataset. The method employs a nonparametric probabilistic function and the Markov random field to consider the spatio-temporal correlations in the probe vehicle dataset. The method is applied to an actual dataset provided by 40000 commercial vehicles all over Japan.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317717","probe vehicle;incident detection;Markov random field (MRF);k-means++","Probes;Roads;Traffic control;Conferences;Correlation;Global Positioning System","data mining;Markov processes;road traffic;spatiotemporal phenomena;traffic engineering computing","detection method;wide-area incident;massive probe vehicle data;spatio-temporal data;road traffic;wide-area datasets;multidimensional form;entire dataset;incident detection;traffic flow;spatio-temporal dimension;data mining method;large-scale road network;probe vehicle dataset;spatio-temporal correlations;actual dataset;information and communication technologies;traffic situation;commercial vehicles;passive datasets","","","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To guarantee the prediction accuracy, we tend to propose a non-convex low-rank plus sparse decomposition model to separate the rearranged matrix into low-rank and sparse matrices. In particular, the low-rank matrix is essentially related to the stable change of traffic flow which most extensively occurs; whereas the sparse matrix corresponds to the drastic change of traffic flow which rarely occurs. The resulting non-convex optimization problem can be efficiently handled using the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) algorithm. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and wavelet neural network (WNN) are introduced to respectively predict the low-rank and sparse matrices (not the whole vessel traffic flow). The final vessel traffic flow can be correspondingly obtained by integrating the predicted low-rank and sparse components. The proposed two-step method is more robust to undesirable artifacts (i.e., data collection errors) and can generate high-accuracy prediction. Experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317741","","Sparse matrices;Optimization;Neural networks;Predictive models;Matrix decomposition;Conferences","autoregressive moving average processes;concave programming;marine communication;neural nets;sparse matrices;time series;wavelet transforms","original vessel traffic flow data;one-dimensional time series;two-dimensional matrix;rearranged matrix;low-rank matrix;sparse matrices;final vessel traffic flow;sparse components;nonconvex optimization problem;nonconvex low-rank plus sparse decomposition model;augmented Lagrange multiplier;ALM algorithm;autoregressive integrated moving average;ARIMA;wavelet neural network;WNN;vessel traffic flow separation-prediction","","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, we generate a set of clothoid tentacles in the egocentered reference frame related to the ego-vehicle, those tentacles represent possible local trajectories. Thirdly, we modify the evidential grid in order to take into consideration some traffic rules such as safety distance between vehicles.

One way to contradict this issue is more accurate range estimation, which can be achieved by reducing uncertainties in the energy consumption forecast on a selected route. In this work, we introduce a method for range estimation considering system uncertainties. To decrease aforementioned uncertainties, we present a recursive algorithm using multi-model estimation for including driving resistance parameters in the forecast. These parameters are transferred to a hybrid powertrain model which combines the standard longitudinal consumption model with a function approximation for the dynamic driving behavior on a specific route segment. This approximation relies on appropriate statistical driving features. With help of several real test drives we showed that the method reduces range estimation uncertainty significantly, it is less than half in one exemplary scenario.

Instead of handcrafting a set of features for classification, we scale each candidate as a 10-by-10 image patch and use its raw RGB pixel values as the input of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The classifiers are trained only using a Singapore dataset, and are tested on the US LISA dataset. The cross validation justifies the generalizability of our classifiers.

Therefore, a traffic state estimation (TSE) method based on higher-order models could have notable advantages over conventional method based on an equilibrium (first-order) model. First, they can encompass non-equilibrium traffic phenomena inherent to the nonlinearity of traffic flow. Second, they can directly fuse heterogeneous traffic data, such as flow measured by detectors and speed measured by probe vehicles. These features would be useful for large volumes of data. This article proposes a data-assimilation-based TSE method for capturing non-equilibrium traffic dynamics based on the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model, which is known as a physically-consistent higher-order model but not received as much attention as other models. The proposed method can efficiently and simply fuse heterogeneous data. Additionally, it is computationally efficient because it uses the extended Kalman filter with an analytical derivative. The features of the proposed method were investigated empirically and quantitatively using experimental dataset collected from actual traffic. We investigate the empirical relationship between the accuracy and amount of available data, and compare the proposed method with a conventional TSE method.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317597","","Probes;Mathematical model;Detectors;Data models;Vehicle dynamics;Computational modeling;Estimation","data assimilation;Kalman filters;road traffic;sensor fusion;state estimation","heterogeneous traffic data;data-assimilation;nonequilibrium traffic dynamics;Aw-Rascle-Zhang model;higher-order model;heterogeneous data;actual traffic;conventional TSE method;traffic state estimation method;higher-order traffic flow models;traffic oscillation;equilibrium model;nonequilibrium traffic phenomena","","2","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Work zone crashes are not only a problem for the drivers, they are a serious concern for highway workers who are injured or killed by errant vehicles. Each year, over 20,000 workers are injured in work zones. A number of factors contribute to work zone crashes, including inattention, speeding, and driving under influence, all driver behavior factors. Unfortunately, driver behavior in work zones is not well understood. The naturalistic driving study (NDS) data, collected by the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2), offers a rare opportunity for a first-hand view of crashes and near-crashes that occur around work zones and to compare them to non-work zone events. Four machine learning algorithms: Random forest, Deep Neural Network, Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network, and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), were applied to work zone events within NDS data. The Random forest algorithm performed the best in classifying NDS data into crashes, near-crashes, and baseline using pre-event variables. The prediction accuracy for work zone events was 97.7% for three classes: crash, near-crash, and baseline and 88.7% for two classes: crash and near-crash. These accuracies were significantly higher than a Naïve predictor's accuracies of 62.6% and 74.2%, respectively.

Experimental results show consistent accuracy improvements over the baseline FCN in several datasets and it is also visually evident in our test videos shared on YouTube.

Instead of relying on traffic demand, a novel model, called the ideal flow model, aids in this optimization by making use of traffic supply information. The model offers a unique approach to analyzing intersection capacity since it utilizes the network structure as well as the transition probability of a random walk or using Markov chain, as an alternative to the information that an OD matrix provides. In this paper, the ideal flow model is used to analyze a crossing type intersection. It investigates the steady state solution when the total flow is maximized and when the design of an intersection is optimum.

However, the nonstationary properties and abrupt changes of travel time series make challenges in obtaining accurate and reliable predictions. Recent achievements of deep learning approaches in classification and regression shed a light on innovations of time series prediction. This study establishes a series of long short-term memory neural networks with deep neural layers (LSTM-DNN) using 16 settings of hyperparameters and investigates their performance on a 90-day travel time dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Then competitive LSTM-DNN models are tested along with linear models such as linear regression, Ridge and Lasso regression, ARIMA and DNN models under 10 sets of sliding windows and predicting horizons via the same dataset.

As such, decisions made in design, implementation, and operation may precondition the successful performance of the overall urban system. To fully understand the impacts of these decisions there is a need for an integrated analysis, where rail is analyzed as a component of a larger and more complex transportation system. In this paper we present a new rail simulator as an integrated component of a comprehensive agent-based mobility simulation platform. By leveraging a multi-modal activity-based demand formulation and mesoscopic dynamic network supply simulation, our proposed design aims primarly to capture the impacts of complex dynamics between individual traveler behavior, the design and operation of a rail system, and the performance of all other modes. A second aim is flexibility; through the implementation of a flexible architecture, the simulation of a wide variety of different rail operational configurations and scenarios becomes feasible. As a demonstration of capabilities the simulator is used to replicate the operations and performance of a fully automated Mass Rapid Transit line in Singapore. The simulator was calibrated using a novel sequential calibration method with only automatic fare card data, without requiring automatic train control or manually collected data, and validated with another dataset. The proposed rail simulator can be used for the assessment of different rail control strategies under regular and disruption conditions, and to evaluate the performance of the road and other public transportation networks and users.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317890","","Rails;Schedules;Conferences;Roads;Public transportation;Vehicle dynamics","calibration;digital simulation;public administration;public transport;rail traffic;railways;rapid transit systems;software agents","rail simulator;integrated component;mobility simulation platform;mesoscopic dynamic network supply simulation;complex dynamics;rail system;fully automated Mass Rapid Transit line;different rail control strategies;public transportation networks;urban rail;multimodal environment;high-frequency rail transit systems;dense urban transportation;urban system;larger transportation system;rail operational configurations;complex transportation system;demand and supply","","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite well paved and maintained roads, sophisticated buses and modern bus control and monitoring systems, bus passengers, especially standing passengers, are frequently subjected to braking and acceleration actions along the way and sway discomforts along the curves. Modern buses come with rather powerful braking systems that are sensitive to slightest pressure on brakes by drivers. Passenger injuries as well as complaints increase as such. When crowd sourcing via using smartphone apps is employed, anyone ranging from a child to senior citizen can access and register a complaint about a discomfort moment along bus rides. Filtering genuine complaints is a challenge. We study a basic case of a person registering discomfort in a bus ride using the smartphone app developed for this purpose. At the back-end, the app keeps collecting sensor data. Findings provide a basis for developing machine-learning algorithms for big-data analytics of passenger feedback at a large-scale.

One of the major challenges for many years to come is to identify risks and benefits of these functions in order to enable a market introduction. Due to the fact that automated driving functions are working in large operation spaces with a driving behavior resulting from complex decision making algorithms, identifying their benefits and drawbacks by only using real world driving tests will not be feasible. In addition, it is possible that automated driving will lead to complete new accident scenarios while others such as rear end collisions may disappear. Therefore, new methods which incorporate virtual testing have to be developed. In this paper a framework for safety performance assessment of automated driving is developed by combining the advantages of learning- and model-based approaches for incorporating human behaviour as a reference for assessment. Whereas learning-based Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used for identifying the frequency of the occurrence of safety relevant scenarios in traffic, detailed models for human driver performance obtained from driving simulator studies are used for deriving the change of impact in these safety relevant scenarios induced by automated driving. Finally, it is analysed which distance behaviour of automated driving functions is optimal in terms of reduction of injury risk.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317706","","Hidden Markov models;Safety;Data models;Injuries;Predictive models;Analytical models;Accidents","decision making;driver information systems;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);road accidents;road safety;road vehicles","world driving tests;safety performance assessment;safety relevant scenarios;human driver performance;automated driving functions;human driver models;complex decision making algorithms;learning-based hidden Markov models;HMM;model-based approaches;driving simulator;injury risk reduction","","1","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mostly the problem is approached as a classification problem in which each class represents a possible action in the next few seconds. In this work, we re-define the task as a regression problem, in which the time until the ego-vehicle touches the other lane is predicted. In particular, we use Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) networks to learn to predict the time to lane change. Even though a regression-based formulation of the problem captures more information and should thus be harder to learn, we can show that it provides slightly better results than a comparable classification-based approach. Moreover, the additional precision that we get about the exact time of the impending the lane change could be used to further increase a user's acceptance of advanced driver assistance systems. We also show that it is possible to individualize the network by fine-tuning it to a particular driver's behavior. The fine-tuning results in an improvement of F1-Score while observing about 20 minutes of driving data from that driver.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317674","","Vehicles;Hidden Markov models;Labeling;Predictive models;Conferences;Advanced driver assistance systems","behavioural sciences computing;driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;road vehicles","time-to-lane-change prediction;deep learning;predicting driver behavior;impending lane change;classification problem;regression problem;Long-Short-Term-Memory networks;advanced driver assistance systems;ego-vehicle;regression-based formulation;user acceptance;F1-Score;fine-tuning","","3","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Once it has gathered enough information about the road ahead, then the autonomous car can safely overtake. We generate safe trajectories by solving, in real-time, a non-linear constrained optimization, formulated as a Receding Horizon planner. The planner is guided by a high-level state machine, which determines when the overtake maneuver should begin.

The obtained parameters of road environment in color on road structure are used to classify weather in video briefly, and the corresponding algorithm and features are applied for robust road edge detection. To visualize the road appearance as well as evaluate the accuracy of detected road, a compact road profile image is generated to reduce the data to a small fraction of video.

However, most existing work have studied the EAD application from an ego-vehicle perspective (Ego-EAD), where a single vehicle makes use of Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I2V) communication, without considering the effect on traffic throughput. To date, relatively limited research about EAD application takes into account cooperation among vehicles at intersections via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, aiming to benefit not only one vehicle but the entire traffic flow. In this study, we develop a cluster-wise cooperative EAD (Coop-EAD) system to further reduce energy consumption while increasing traffic throughput, compared to existing Ego-EAD applications. Instead of considering CAVs traveling through signalized intersections one at a time, our approach strategically coordinates CAVs' maneuvers to form clusters with the proposed methodologies: initial vehicle clustering, intra-cluster sequence optimization, and cluster formation control. The EAD algorithm is then applied to the cluster leader, and CAVs in the cluster can conduct EAD maneuvers by following the dynamics of the cluster leader. A comprehensive simulation study shows that, compared to an Ego-EAD system, the proposed Coop-EAD system achieves 50% increase on traffic throughput, 11% reduction on energy consumption, and up to 20% reduction on pollutant emissions, respectively.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317924","Eco-Approach and Departure;connected and automated vehicles;cluster;cooperative","Energy consumption;Throughput;Conferences;Optimization;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles;Clustering algorithms","cooperative communication;energy conservation;energy consumption;optimisation;road vehicles;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","signalized arterials;Departure application;signalized intersection;energy-efficient manner;EAD application;ego-vehicle perspective;traffic throughput;Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication;cluster-wise cooperative EAD system;energy consumption;initial vehicle clustering;intra-cluster sequence optimization;cluster formation control;cluster leader;Ego-EAD system;Coop-EAD system;traffic flow;cluster-wise cooperative eco-approach;Infrastructure-to-Vehicle communication;Ego-EAD applications;connected and automated vehicles;Signal Phase and Timing information","","2","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the scale of the transit network grows in terms of the number of stations, number of connections / services, and the number of transit operators, manual itinerary search may fail to detect best possible itineraries. Another challenging factor is the need to include the constraints imposed by intermediate stations on the creation of itineraries. One such constraint is the transfer time needed to alight one vehicle, and board another vehicle at a station. Other constraints such as non-availability of transport vehicles, and congestion have local origins, but affect the set of feasible itineraries. We introduce a generic model for a dynamic network. In our proposed dynamic network model, we incorporate both the local constraints (of a station), and the global constraints (user preferences). In this work, we use an Actor-based concurrent approach to design a transit scheduler. We model each transit station as an Actor, thereby gaining the advantage of accounting for dynamism in transit networks. Our system performs concurrent itinerary search over transit schedules. Our approach allows real-time updates to timetables, and status of transit stations. Our approach also solves the centralized schedule management problem by incorporating local update capability into the transit scheduler. Thus we enable local network operators to manage the vehicular traffic at their respective stations. We are also able to filter the itinerary search results based on user preferences. We have implemented a multimodal transit scheduler that has a median query completion time of ~0.9 seconds on the public transit networks of India.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317855","","Mathematical model;Schedules;Vehicle dynamics;Real-time systems;Bridges;Transportation;Conferences","mobile radio;scheduling;transportation","transport vehicles;dynamic network model;local constraints;global constraints;concurrent approach;transit station;centralized schedule management problem;local network operators;itinerary search results;multimodal transit scheduler;interactive journey planning applications;multimodal public transit networks;transit operators;actor-based concurrent approach;concurrent itinerary search;local update capability;vehicular traffic;median query completion time","","1","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sufficient charging infrastructure is, however, needed in order to accommodate their power demand and increase EV adoption. In this paper, we propose a simulation-based approach for charging station (CS) placement using an agent-based traffic simulation. The heuristic's objective is to achieve sufficient network coverage to keep charging related inconvenience within an acceptable range while minimising the overall number of CSs. For this purpose, the algorithm identifies locations at which the charging procedure seamlessly integrates into the drivers' itineraries, thus minimising detours and waiting times. At the same time, the algorithm attempts to maximise the utilisation of each CS throughout the day in order to minimise the number of CSs. The methodology is demonstrated at the example of Singapore. The investigation shows that the charging demand of 20,000 EVs can be covered with approximately 2,500 CSs by accepting average detours no greater than 410 metres and average waiting time below 10 minutes. This number can be further reduced by relaxing the inconvenience criterion.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317680","","Cascading style sheets;State of charge;Batteries;Vehicles;Energy consumption;Charging stations;Safety","electric vehicle charging","sustainable transportation system;city-scale electric vehicle charging station placement;agent-based traffic simulation","","2","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work explores the transferability of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) features by retraining the network using a minimal dataset incorporating training data specific to the local environment. A new local dataset is manually annotated and used to train a neural network for pixel-level semantic image information. Since data annotation is time-consuming, we evaluate the transferability of CNNs and the performance of different data augmentation methods for dataset expansion. Small datasets are normally considered not sufficient for training a neural network from scratch. This paper presents an incremental fine-tunning algorithm to update the pre-trained network.

Based on data collected by loop detectors, typical segments with two, three and four lanes in one direction are selected from the South-North Expressway in Shanghai. Rain intensity is classified into light, moderate, heavy and torrential in this study. Firstly, an exponential speed-density model is used to describe the relationship of speed and density under both clear weather and rainfall. Based on the results of model fitting, the effects of rainfall on free flow speed and operating speed are studied. Results show that free flow speed decreases most on segments with two lanes, with 0.3-5%, 5.1-7.4%, 4.6-8.2% and 9.8-13.3% reductions under light, moderate, heavy and torrential rain, respectively. This suggests that drivers' sight and judgement are easy to be affected on segments with only two lanes. In addition, a reduction factor is introduced to study the influence of rainfall on operating speed, and traffic flow is divided into congested and uncongested flow with the optimum density. The reduction of operating speed under congested conditions is larger than that under uncongested conditions, especially for segments with three and four lanes. So it is essential to make sure the traffic operation of segments with more than two lanes in each direction of urban expressways on rainy days.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317751","urban expressways;rainfall;free flow speed;operating speed","Rain;Mathematical model;Standards;Fitting;Roads;Data models","rain;road traffic;road vehicles;statistical analysis","speed characteristics;urban expressways;rainy conditions;rainfall;lanes;South-North Expressway;rain intensity;exponential speed-density model;free flow speed;operating speed;moderate rain;heavy rain;torrential rain;congested flow;uncongested flow;traffic operation;Shanghai","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach comprises two modules: a clustering module and classification module. The clustering module uses a K-means algorithm to distribute the vehicle travel mode into a proper cluster. The classification module uses the random forest classifier, which is assigned to each group of vehicle travel mode, to classify the road surface conditions.

First, the paper begins with a generic taxonomic survey of semantic segmentation algorithms and then discusses how it fits in the context of automated driving. Second, the particular challenges of deploying it into a safety system which needs high level of accuracy and robustness are listed.

Distinct propagation rules consider time-dependent travel speeds, turning fractions at intersections and vehicle gain-loss ratios between links. The rules are derived from recorded vehicle paths originating from a probe vehicle data (PVD) system including data from thousands of vehicles from several different fleets. The proposed approach introduces a algorithm with dedicated propagation rules and measures for evaluating propagation quality.

Although scene parsing is able to make segmentation of road area from other objects and background, it basically does not get involved in recognizing other on-road markings. In fact, detection and classification of road area are only one small step towards true autonomous driving, because there are many categories of informative markings embodied within road area, such as lane markings, arrows, guiding lines, pedestrian crosswalks, and no-vehicle signs. If system identifies those markings, more information for both ADAS and self-driving car system can be provided. For this purpose, we release a benchmark dataset named TRoM (Tsinghua Road Marking), which is served for detection of 19 road-marking categories in urban scenarios. TRoM was built by means of over one-month data covering a full spectrum of time, weather, and traffic-load. An annotation toolkit was also presented to facilitate enriching such dataset.

In addition, increasing costs and globally rising transport volumes are increasing the pressure on vehicle manufacturers to find the optimum fuel and powertrain setup for heavy-duty (HD) vehicles. This paper presents a new approach to optimizing HD truck powertrains with diesel, natural-gas, diesel-electric and natural-gas-electric engines. The contradiction between maximizing the transport efficiency and minimizing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) leads to a method of solving multi-objective problems (MOPs) using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The use of EAs to solve MOPs is mainly motivated by the population-based method of EAs, which allows several elements of the Pareto optimal set to be generated in a single run. The basic algorithm adopted for this purpose is K. Deb's NSGA-II. In order to optimize the vehicle drivetrain, not only are the sizes of the combustion engine, electric motor and the battery allowed to vary, but different component models are also considered, including different gearboxes, operating strategies and battery cell types. Several constraints are applied in the algorithm, such as climbing ability, minimum engine power, and battery charge rates. The designed vehicles are based on real engine maps and are simulated with real-life measured driving cycles, including autobahn and federal road elements. The results were validated with the simulation software AVL Cruise and Dyna4. The objective of the developed methodology is to present the best possible solution with respect to transport efficiency and TCO.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317753","","Mechanical power transmission;Engines;Optimization;Acceleration;Fuels;High definition video","air pollution control;design engineering;evolutionary computation;fuel economy;internal combustion engines;Pareto optimisation;power transmission (mechanical);road vehicles","minimum engine power;battery charge rates;engine maps;autobahn;federal road elements;TCO;multicriterion optimization;heavy-duty powertrain design;transport efficiency;commercial vehicle industry;regulatory program;greenhouse gas emissions;transport volumes;vehicle manufacturers;optimum fuel;powertrain setup;heavy-duty vehicles;optimizing HD truck powertrains;natural-gas-electric engines;multiobjective problems;evolutionary algorithms;Pareto optimal;vehicle drivetrain;combustion engine;electric motor;diesel-electric engine;carbon-dioxide targets;total cost of ownership minimisation;MOP;EA;simulation software AVL Cruise;Dyna4;CO<sub>2</sub>","","2","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Road traffic congestion is a critical socio-economic issue as it causes high fuel consumption, waste of time, increased environmental pollution, frustration and safety issues. Major reason for increased road traffic congestion is the suboptimal use of available resources such as time and road space due to the static traffic signal plan. Traffic density at multiple adjacent intersections is not effectively considered in current traffic signal control plans. Novel perimeter gating control mechanism based on the dynamic traffic conditions in multiple intersections is proposed using multi-agent systems to improve the throughput of macroscopic traffic networks. Multi-agent systems facilitate the communication and coordination between adjacent intersections. Goal is to attain the emerging effect of minimizing the time loss due to traffic congestion over time for a selected area. Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulation suite along with Java Agent Development Environment (JADE) is used to assess the proposed perimeter gating control mechanism.

This can impact traffic flow operations, especially the roadway capacity and flow stability. It is of paramount importance to understand and predict the implications of automated driving systems on traffic flow at the early design phase to avoid disruptive impacts on traffic. String stability properties of automated vehicle platoons are a fundamental block to understand their traffic flow stability impact. Previous reports on string stability analysis focussed on homogeneous vehicle strings and simplify the time delays in vehicle systems. This work propose an analytical approach to determine string stability conditions for non-connected vehicle platoons with heterogeneous parameters. To this end, a third-order linear vehicle dynamics model is used in the control design and Laplace transform of the spacing and speed error dynamics in time domain to frequency domain enables the determination of sufficient string stability criteria of heterogeneous vehicle strings. The analytical string stability conditions give new insights into the relationship between the string stability properties of vehicle strings in relation to the system properties of time delays and controller design parameters of feedback gains and desired time gap. Analytical results are verified via systematic simulation of both homogeneous and heterogeneous strings. Simulations demonstrate the predictive power of the analytical string stability conditions.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317792","","Stability criteria;Sensors;Delays;Vehicle dynamics;Actuators;Delay effects","adaptive control;control system synthesis;delays;feedback;Laplace transforms;road traffic control;road vehicles;stability criteria;vehicle dynamics","string stability criteria;heterogeneous vehicle strings;third-order linear vehicle dynamics model;heterogeneous parameters;nonconnected vehicle platoons;vehicle systems;homogeneous vehicle strings;string stability analysis;traffic flow stability impact;automated vehicle platoons;automated driving systems;roadway capacity;traffic flow operations;nonconnected automated vehicles;heterogeneous platoons;heterogeneous strings;homogeneous strings;controller design parameters;time delays;system properties;string stability properties;analytical string stability conditions","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a mechanism for driver identification based on driving dynamics signals currently available in production cars. The system collects and filters sensing data in a sliding window iteration, computes statistical and spectral features and finally provides driver identification for each window frame through a classification process. Finally, a decision function takes individual predictions and outputs a single prediction for the ongoing trip. We evaluate the impact of various elements of the process on identification accuracy, including sliding window size, classifier algorithms and feature sets. Results show that complementing gas pedal signal with steering wheel cepstral analysis improves identification accuracy by 22.4%. We also show that Boosting classifiers provide better predictions for our problem and the best results have been achieved using AdaBoost with 95,89,82 percent accuracies for 5,15,35 drivers respectively.

We propose a gated factor graph framework to use semantic information associated with visual features to make decisions on outlier/ inlier computation from three perspectives: the feature tracking process, the geo-referenced map building process, and the navigation system using pre-mapped landmarks. The class category that the visual feature belongs to is extracted from a pre-trained deep learning network trained for semantic segmentation. The feasibility and generality of our approach is demonstrated by our implementations on top of two vision-based navigation systems.

By spanning a three-dimensional grid of fixed size around each point cloud we are able to transform three-dimensional input to become processable by CNNs.

ETACP is useful in when for a user it is not important to choose the fastest route, but the one that guarantees with high probability to reach the desired destination within a given time (e.g., take a train, arrive to a office that is closing soon).

Weight data from such TECs can be useful for road authorities for purposes such as evaluating road wear and traffic safety. The first aim of this paper is to evaluate how accurate weight data from such systems are, while the second aim is to examine if one site's accuracy changes over time. We also want to see if calibration coefficients can be used to improve the accuracy of the acquired weight data. The last aim is to assess the weight data's accuracy classes and subsequent areas of application according to COST 323. The methods involve comparing dynamic weight data from a piezo-based TEC with corresponding static weights. This enables assessment of the system's accuracy and precision, and is performed on two dates to evaluate if it changes over time. Also, calibration coefficients are used to try to improve the accuracy. Lastly, accuracy classes are calculated according to COST 323. Our findings were that there was a systematic error between the dynamic and static weights, which increased with increasing vehicle weights. Also, the system's accuracy changed over time. One factor contributing to this was different mean static weights during the two data acquisitions, which was caused by different vehicle samples. Moreover, calibration coefficients generally improved the accuracy, but not the precision of the dynamic weight data. At their best, the dynamic weight data were found to have accuracy class B (10), which is accurate enough for pre-selection of vehicles and designing roads. The other weight data reached the less accurate accuracy class D (25).","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317612","weigh-in-motion;WIM;piezoelectric sensors;dynamic weight;traffic enforcement camera","Vehicle dynamics;Sensor systems;Calibration;Roads;Cameras;Weight measurement","calibration;cameras;condition monitoring;data acquisition;image processing;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;roads;traffic engineering computing","COST 323;vehicle weights;data acquisitions;calibration coefficients;dynamic weight data;vehicle weight estimation;TEC;speed limit enforcement;road wear;traffic safety;accuracy classes;mean static weights;traffic enforcement cameras;piezoelectric sensors;Norwegian system","","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pedestrian detection and tracking based on a single feature type cannot always achieve the desired performance, especially in low visibility conditions. To improve the pedestrian detection rate, in this paper we propose a method for high-level decision fusion based on the detection outputs from multiple cameras. Low-level processing entails the capture, calibration and registration steps. The high-level processing consists of pedestrian detection, tracking of the detected pedestrians, and fusing the tracking outputs into a common multi-camera view. By relying on parallel tracks we are able to detect objects and follow them more efficiently without losing track. Moreover, each target receives specific signature which serves as an identification of the individual target. When the target pedestrian from any of the side views enters the area of the front looking camera, the identity of its track is handed over to the corresponding front view tracker. The proposed strategy improves early detection of pedestrians, which is critical for driving safety.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317755","autonomous vehicles;vision;pedestrian detection;fusion;rgb;visible;thermal;infrared;ADAS","Cameras;Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Target tracking;Robustness","cameras;image fusion;mobile robots;object detection;object tracking;pedestrians;road vehicles;robot vision;traffic engineering computing","frontal-lateral collaborative pedestrian detection;autonomous driving;assisted driving;situation awareness tasks;pedestrian tracking;hybrid sensor fusion;high-level decision fusion;parallel tracks;target pedestrian;pedestrian detection;multicamera view","","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An often overlooked aspect is that motion planning is usually done using simplified models, which do not always sufficiently conform to the real behavior of vehicles. Thus, collision avoidance and drivability is not necessarily ensured. We address this problem by modeling vehicles as differential inclusions composed of simple dynamics and set-based uncertainty; conformance testing is used to determine the required uncertainty. To quickly provide the set of solutions for these uncertain models, we use pre-computed reachable sets (i.e., the union of all possible solutions) for pre-selected motion primitives. The reachable sets of vehicles are obtained through the novel combination of optimization techniques and reachability analysis in the controller synthesis - they enable us to guarantee safety by checking their mutual non-intersection for consecutive time intervals.

Recent efforts made in accurate aircraft taxi time prediction have shown significant advancement in generating more efficient taxi routes and schedules, benefiting other key airside operations, such as runway sequencing and gate assignment. However, little study has been devoted to quantification of uncertainty associated with taxiing aircraft. Routes and schedules generated based on deterministic and accurate taxi time prediction for an aircraft may not be resilient under uncertainties due to factors such as varying weather conditions, operational scenarios and pilot behaviours, impairing system-wide performance as taxi delays can propagate throughout the network. Therefore, the primary aim of this paper is to utilise multi-objective fuzzy rule-based systems to better quantify such uncertainties based on historic aircraft taxiing data. Preliminary results reveals that the proposed approach can capture uncertainty in a more informative way, and hence represents a promising tool to further develop robust taxi planning to reduce delays due to uncertain taxi times.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317826","","Public transportation;Uncertainty;Aircraft;Airports;Fuzzy sets;Conferences","air traffic;air traffic control;aircraft control;airports;fuzzy set theory;optimisation;scheduling;transportation","taxi routes;weather conditions;aircraft taxi time;impairing system-wide performance;air traffic management;taxi delays;pilot behaviours;operational scenarios;taxiing aircraft;key airside operations;schedules;robust ATM systems;air transportation networks;uncertainty quantification;multiobjective fuzzy rule","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mobility-on-demand systems have been proposed as a remedy to the problem of limited parking space because they are able to satisfy the existing transportation demand with fewer shared vehicles and consequently require less parking space. Yet, the impact of large-scale vehicle sharing on traffic patterns is not well understood. In this work, we perform a simulation-based analysis of consequences of a hypothetical deployment of a large-scale station-based mobility-on-demand system in Prague and measure the traffic intensity generated by the system and its effects on the formation of congestion. We find that such a mobility-on-demand system would lead to significantly increased total driven distance and it would also increase levels of congestion due to extra trips without passengers. In fact, 38% kilometers traveled in such an MoD system would be driven empty.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317830","","Roads;Urban areas;Space vehicles;Automobiles;Conferences","mobility management (mobile radio);road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","traffic congestion;simulation-based study;private vehicles;parking space;road network capacity;densely populated urban areas;transportation demand;large-scale vehicle sharing;traffic patterns;large-scale station-based mobility-on-demand system;traffic intensity;MoD system","","1","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More precisely, we show that characteristic profiles of handovers within and between clusters of mobile network cells exist. We base these profiles on models from road traffic flow theory, and show that they can be used for traffic state estimation using floating-car data as ground truth.

However, there is substantial evidence that as new levels of automation are introduced, systems still are prone to unsafe behaviors when interacting with humans. This means that the communication and interaction between the driver and the automation must be carefully modeled and optimized to guarantee safe performance. We present a framework that formalizes designing user interfaces for intelligent vehicles, by optimizing informativeness subject to brevity and utility. By modeling the system as a communication channel, we estimate the reduction of entropy of human-autonomy system, given a probability distribution over attributes obtained from user data, and information constraints to ensure brevity. Through this, we observe an approximately quadratic relationship between the amount of information displayed to the user and performance metrics, referred to as the information-performance trade-off curve. This trend was found in situational awareness, driving performance, and trust in the autonomy. Thus, in order to optimize interaction and performance, quantifying the informativeness of attributes and the conciseness of the interface is key in developing systems that must smoothly interact with humans.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317686","","Entropy;Automation;User interfaces;Autonomous vehicles;Monitoring;Conferences","probability;traffic engineering computing;user interfaces","information constraints;information-performance trade-off curve;interface design;fully autonomous vehicles;user interfaces;intelligent vehicles;informativeness subject;communication channel;human-autonomy system;probability distribution;quadratic relationship;performance safety;situational awareness;driving performance","","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We address the problem of reliable long term (&lt;; 5 sec) prediction of on-road pedestrian trajectories using track histories generated with two vehicle mounted cameras. Due to the relatively unconstrained nature of pedestrian motion, model based trajectory prediction approaches become unreliable for long term prediction. Data-driven approaches offer a viable alternative, but are susceptible to bias toward dominant motion patterns in the training set. This leads to poor prediction for under-represented motion patterns, which can be disastrous from a safety perspective. In this work, we extend the Variational Gaussian Mixture model (VGMM) based probabilistic trajectory prediction framework in [1]. We sub-categorize pedestrian trajectories in an unsupervised manner based on their estimated sources and destinations, and train a separate VGMM for each sub-category. We show that the sub-category VGMMs outperform a monolithic VGMM of equivalent complexity, especially for longer prediction intervals. We further analyze the errors made by the two models and the distributions learnt by them, to demonstrate that the sub-category VGMMs better model under-represented motion patterns.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317865","Multi-perspective vision;pedestrian trajectory prediction;surround behavior analysis;Variational Gaussian Mixture Models (VGMM)","Trajectory;Cameras;History;Gaussian mixture model;Chebyshev approximation;Conferences","Gaussian distribution;image motion analysis;image representation;mixture models;pedestrians;probability;road safety;traffic engineering computing;unsupervised learning","probabilistic trajectory prediction framework;sub-categorize pedestrian trajectories;separate VGMM;monolithic VGMM;on-road pedestrian behavior;pedestrian safety;autonomous vehicles;on-road pedestrian trajectories;pedestrian motion;data-driven approaches;dominant motion patterns;Variational Gaussian Mixture model;model based trajectory prediction;subcategory VGMM","","3","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complexity stems from the nonlinearity of the system and the non-convexity of the configuration space. This paper introduces a novel extend function called Hybrid Curvature (HC) Steer for sampling-based nonholonomic motion planning in tight environments. HC Steer solves the two-point boundary value problem by computing continuous curvature paths while the vehicle is going in one direction, but allows curvature discontinuities at switches in the driving direction. The resulting paths approximate Reeds-Shepp's paths and are directly drivable by an autonomous vehicle. BiRRT*, an optimal sampling-based motion planner, is used to evaluate and compare HC Steer's performance to state of the art steering functions, namely Reeds-Shepp (RS) and Continuous Curvature (CC) Steer. Extensive experiments in challenging environments show HC Steer's advantage of computing smoother paths than RS Steer in equally tight environments and finding solutions with less direction switches, higher success rates, and shorter planning time than CC Steer.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317757","","Planning;Automobiles;Conferences;Autonomous vehicles;Visualization;Optimization","boundary-value problems;collision avoidance;mobile robots;motion control;optimal control;path planning;steering systems","Hybrid curvature steer;nonholonomic motion planning;optimal paths;autonomous driving;nonconvexity;configuration space;two-point boundary value problem;continuous curvature paths;curvature discontinuities;driving direction;autonomous vehicle;optimal sampling-based motion planner;art steering functions;RS Steer;direction switches;CC Steer;planning time;novel extend function;HC Steer;tight environments;Reeds-Shepp paths;BiRRT","","4","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart transportation systems are needed for efficient operations of the core economic activities. To develop such systems, we focus on multimodal urban transport systems, particularly on the optimization of dedicated bus lanes which is regarded as one of the most promising traffic demand management measures. Although there exists a great body of literature on the operation and planning of the dedicated bus lanes, quantitative approach is still lacked for evaluating the relationship between lane space and traffic performance, especially at the system level. In this context, [8] proposed to decide the allocation of the dedicated bus lanes based on the three-dimensional macroscopic fundamental diagram (3D-MFD). The proposed bus lane optimization framework was applied and tested utilizing the Geneva network via simulation. This paper follows the direction of the 3D-MFD based macroscopic approach, and it implements this approach, with slight modification, to the Tokyo CBD area which has a complete different and more complex network structure, to verify the robustness and the universality of the approach. We illustrate the 3D-MFD for the current network. It is found that the results of 3D-MFD are consistent with the results of [9]. That is, it is crucial to ensure certain number of buses running in the network, in order to optimize the network performance in terms of passenger service throughput.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317936","Dedicated bus lane;Road Space Allocation Optimization;Multimodal system;3D-MFD;Passenger Flow","Roads;Resource management;Space exploration;Optimization;Automobiles;Conferences;Urban areas","complex networks;economics;optimisation;public transport;road traffic;road vehicles;town and country planning;traffic engineering computing","multimodal urban networks;Tokyo CBD network;traffic congestion;urban areas;smart transportation systems;multimodal urban transport systems;dedicated bus lanes;Geneva network;3D-MFD based macroscopic approach;Tokyo CBD area;economic loss;traffic demand management;complex network structure;road space allocation optimization;bus lane optimization;simulation analysis;microscopic traffic simulation;Aimsun","","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is in particular relevant for driving maneuvers such as lane changes. To predict them features have to be taken into account covering a wide range of situations and drivers. Against this background, an algorithm is proposed predicting situations of upcoming lane changes based on assessments of the driving situation, the driver's behavior and the vehicle's movement. It relies on a 360° sensory perception of the vehicular surroundings and on the analysis of the driver's gaze behavior preparing lane changes. The information gained is fused and used for classification by means of an artificial neural network that was parameterized by applying machine learning. The resulting prediction algorithm is working in real-time as a vehicular application.

ACC enables a vehicle to follow a preceding vehicle autonomously and without any additional input form the driver. A reliable ACC must be able to handle driving constraints especially due to safety requirements of the car-following. In practice, constraint handling can be achieved by solving a constrained moving horizon control problem with optimizing a cost function using a prediction of the preceding vehicle's motion. However, uncertainty in the measured data and modeling errors can result in constraint violation and harsh undesired accelerations. The proposed Tube-based MPC ACC uses a tube resulted from bounded additive uncertainties in the system, to achieve robust control with guaranteed constraint handling.

This dilemma manifested in several incidents over the last years, revealing that suitable methodologies for test and validation of autonomous driving are needed. In order to develop and research test and validation strategies, a testbed for autonomous driving functionality is under development at our institute. This testbed contains an autonomous vehicle, which itself consists of different systems providing its autonomy. Key subsystems for this functionality are a path planning and a localization system, supplying the ability to determine the vehicle's position and future track as precisely as possible. In this paper we present a multi-sensorial localization solution suitable for test and validation of autonomous driving. Within this solution, a position is calculated based on time-of-flight measurement within a ultra wideband (UWB) network in addition to odometry and inertial measurements, using a tightly coupled extended Kalman filter with a constant turn rate and constant velocity (CTRV) model to determine the position. The main contribution of this paper is an experimental evaluation of a UWB-based GPS-independent localization solution achieving a localization accuracy of in median 0.25 m with three anchors and up to 0.17 m with seven anchors in dynamic driving situations.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317763","","Mathematical model;Wheels;Kalman filters;Conferences;Autonomous vehicles;Global Positioning System","collision avoidance;distance measurement;Global Positioning System;inertial navigation;Kalman filters;mobile robots;nonlinear filters;off-road vehicles;robot vision;SLAM (robots)","testbed;autonomous driving functionality;autonomous vehicle;localization system;multisensorial localization solution;time-of-flight measurement;UWB;GPS-independent localization solution;localization accuracy;dynamic driving situations;off-road vehicles;ultrawideband network;odometry;inertial measurements;extended Kalman filter;constant turn rate and constant velocity model;CTRV model;path planning;size 0.25 m;size 0.17 m","","1","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An important idea is that fusion of geometry and appearance would boost the performance of each other. Stereo cameras and RGB-D sensors are widely used to realise 3D reconstruction and trajectory tracking, but they need heavy computation cost and storage in a dense way. Moreover, they lack flexibility of seamless switch between various scaled environments, i.e., indoor and outdoor scenes. Besides, autonomous vehicle would benefit from semantic information on the road, but it is hard to be sufficiently accurate and consistent in the 3D mapping. We address this challenge by fusion of direct Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) from a monocular camera in a semi-dense way and the state-of-the-art approaches of deep neural network. In our approach, 2D semantic information is transferred to 3D mapping via correspondence between consecutive Keyframes with spatial consistency. Since there are lots of semantic redundancies in consecutive frames, it is not necessary to process semantic segmentation for each frame in the entire sequence. Consequently, the segmentation could run in a reasonable speed (about 20Hz). We thoroughly evaluate our methods on road scene datasets. The experiments show a promising 3D semantic mapping in various road scenes.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317942","","Three-dimensional displays;Semantics;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Two dimensional displays;Conferences;Image segmentation;Roads","cameras;image colour analysis;image reconstruction;image segmentation;image sequences;mobile robots;neural nets;road vehicles;robot vision;sensor fusion;SLAM (robots);stereo image processing","fast semidense 3D semantic mapping;monocular visual SLAM;fast 3D reconstruction;semantic information;computer vision;stereo cameras;RGB-D sensors;trajectory tracking;indoor scenes;outdoor scenes;monocular camera;semantic redundancies;semantic segmentation;road scene datasets;computation cost;simultaneous localisation and mapping;autonomous vehicle;deep neural network","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The components are; i) human mimic Driver Model (DM) for lane recovery and keeping assessment, and ii) Predictive Model (PM) that has the ability to predict unintentional lane departure. The lane departure prediction is used to minimise the lane keeping steering angle (μ<sub>k</sub>) output from the Lane Keeping Driver Model (LKDM) and the lane recovery steering angle (μ<sub>r</sub>) from the Lane Recovery Driver Model (LRDM). With this design, a small corrective input (steering angle) that guides the vehicle to compensate disturbance (unintentional lane departure) shall reduce the intrusive behaviour during safety intervention of the LDAS. Both model, LKDM and LRDM, are combined to form a single DM. Subsequently, both of the DM and PM are merged to form the LDAS. Two methods were used to formulate the LDAS; i) Neural Network (NN, benchmark approach) and ii) Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NARX, proposed solution). Both LDAS models are evaluated against three road curvatures (ρ = 800m, 3000m, 10000m) and injected with a simulated unintentional lane departure disturbance. The response of each LDAS model is analyzed against the intrusive driving assessment data. The result shows that with a sufficient prediction of time to lane crossing (t<sub>LC</sub>) provided by the PM, the DM is able to provide a small lane recovery and lane keeping steering angle thus ensuring the LDAS to operate within the non-intrusive driving behaviour. This study is important in providing a more human-behavior like LDAS performance.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317655","","Vehicles;Navigation;Safety;Torque;Predictive models;Sensors;Roads","driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);road accidents;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles","Lane Keeping Driver Model;lane recovery steering angle;Lane Recovery Driver Model;intrusive behaviour;safety intervention;LDAS model;simulated unintentional lane departure disturbance;intrusive driving assessment data;lane crossing;nonintrusive driving behaviour;intrusive driving behaviour;lane departure avoidance system;machine learning approach;human mimic Driver Model;Predictive Model;lane departure prediction","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A random term is included in RUMs to resolve similar alternatives and model the unpredictable factors leading a person to make a choice among a discrete set of options. There is no agreed and scientifically proven best way of modelling this term despite having been applied in many diverse fields and little attention has been paid to the underlying phenomena that justify one choice over another. In this paper, we examine theoretically and in a particular taxi traffic simulation in Singapore, the most common choices for the random term, logit and probit, and also contrast them with simple alternatives such as the uniform or triangular distributions. We provide a Unified Random Graph Model (URGM) to explore randomness in RUMs, identify the differences between distribution choices, introduce a novel distribution distance metric, and explore the effect such choices have in a RUM. We contend that the theoretical and practical advantages of the Gaussian and the Gumbel distribution (GaGs) have been overrated in the traffic simulation literature, even without any categorical theoretical or empirical justification for one over the other (we show the Gaussian approximates the Gumbel 81-94% depending on the metric). We provide evidence in favor of the triangular distribution and show that it can approximate the GaGs in the 90s% without some of their demerits. These results are corroborated by our theoretical and experimental analysis, were the Triangular outperforms GaGs and has several theoretical advantages. The analysis is in many ways comparable to the activation function debate in the deep learning literature.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317726","Discrete choice random utility models;RUM;simulation;gumbel;gaussian;triangular distribution;traffic modeling and simulation;comparison of random distributions;SSSB;taxi;electric vehicles","Computational modeling;Public transportation;Analytical models;Random variables;Probability density function;Vehicles;Conferences","graph theory;random processes;statistical distributions;transportation;utility theory","taxi traffic simulation;deep learning literature;random distribution;discrete choice random utility models;unified random graph model;URGM;Gaussian and Gumbel distribution;human choices prediction;novel distribution distance metric;modeling driving decisions;RUM;triangular distribution;transportation utility models","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As AI and IoT technologies are becoming mature, in this paper, we propose to apply AIoT technologies for traffic light control, which is an essential component for intelligent transportation system, to improve the efficiency of smart city's road system. Specifically, various sensors such as surveillance cameras provide real-time information for intelligent traffic light control system to observe the states of both motorized traffic and non-motorized traffic. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic light control solution by using distributed multi-agent Q learning, considering the traffic information at the neighboring intersections as well as local motorized and non-motorized traffic, to improve the overall performance of the entire control system. By using the proposed multi-agent Q learning algorithm, our solution is targeting to optimize both the motorized and non-motorized traffic. In addition, we considered many constraints/rules for traffic light control in the real world, and integrate these constraints in the learning algorithm, which can facilitate the proposed solution to be deployed in real operational scenarios. We conducted numerical simulations for a real-world map with real-world traffic data.

The clustering stage generates subgraphs of road network according to different spatial and semantic parameters that allow considering a lot of features of real objects in a compressed form. A memetic algorithm finds optimal road network structure using obtained clusters. The study combines two approaches to develop a road network (the urban planning and the transport engineering). Therefore the fitness function of a memetic algorithm contains the following criteria from the both approaches: a connectivity, a pedestrian accessibility, a provision of the territory with transport system, a reliability, and an accident rate. The method was verified on two datasets: the city of Samara and Koshelev Project.

However, in dense urban areas, even if combined with vehicle on-board sensors, they lead to large localization errors due to multipath and signal blockage. In recent years, Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs) have gained increasing attention as they allow vehicles to cooperate and broadcast safety-related information to the neighbors through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. In this paper, a novel cooperative positioning method is developed by exploiting V2V communications without using explicit V2V ranging. Vehicles localize, in a distributed way, a set of jointly sensed non-cooperative features (e.g., people, traffic lights) and use them as common noisy reference points to implicitly enhance their own position accuracy. Distributed belief propagation is combined with consensus-based estimation of the features' positions to enable cooperative localization of vehicles. Numerical results show that the proposed method is able to significantly enhance the GPS-based vehicle location accuracy, especially in scenarios with dense feature deployments.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317801","","Global Positioning System;Iterative closest point algorithm;Sensors;Noise measurement;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Distance measurement","cooperative communication;Global Positioning System;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","satellite-based navigation systems;GPS;vehicle on-board sensors;Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems;Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications;vehicle location accuracy;vehicle positioning;V2V ranging","","1","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This estimate can then be used for example to adapt the systems' warning and intervention strategies according to the driver's needs. We propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) which operates in the ground plane at pixel level and simultaneously tracks two gaze motion models to model the driver's focus of attention. We introduce a new time variant transition probability for motion hypotheses of fixations and saccades combining spatial and temporal domain motivated by human gaze motion characteristics.

In this paper we present a method which enables the autonomous vehicles to increase the availability of lane change manoeuvres by reducing the required margins to ensure a safe manoeuvre. The required safety margins are first calculated by making use of the steering and braking capability of the vehicle. It is then shown that this method can be used to perform autonomous lane changes in dense traffic situations with small inter-vehicle gaps.

To achieve accurate results, the driver behavior in traffic simulation needs to be representative. Since the driver behavior are simulated by car following models, these models need to be calibrated to reproduce traffic flow as well as energy demand similar to drivers in real traffic. In this paper, three car following models commonly used in traffic simulation, i.e., the intelligent driver model (IDM), the Krauss car following model, and the Wiedemann car following model, are calibrated and verified on around 200 recorded trips. The trip data are collected from human drivers driving on the Drive Me route, which is an autonomous drive test route in Gothenburg, Sweden. To find the optimal parameters of the car following models, a Genetic Algorithm minimizes a performance index which is derived to reflect the error in the vehicle's impact on traffic flow as well as its energy demand, compared to a reference trip. The result of the simulation shows that in average, the optimized IDM can replicate driving behaviors best compared to the other two models. It is also shown that adding a time delay improves the performance of all the models.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317836","Car Following Model;Traffic simulation;Intelligent driver model;Krauss;Wiedemann;Performance Index;Drive Me","Automobiles;Acceleration;Data models;Optimization;Delay effects;Genetic algorithms","calibration;genetic algorithms;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","real-world driving data;traffic simulation software;vehicle technologies;traffic flow;energy demand;driver behavior;intelligent driver model;Wiedemann car;trip data;human drivers;Drive Me route;autonomous drive test route;genetic algorithm;performance index minimization;vehicle impact;Wiedemann car following model;Krauss car following model","","1","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, a method of estimating FD using measurements from GPS-equipped probe vehicles (also known as connected vehicles) is developed. Specifically, the proposed method estimate values of free-flow speed and backward wave speed of so-called triangular FD based on trajectories of multiple probe vehicles which are randomly sampled.

As LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods suffer from error accumulation, state-of-the-art approaches match the point cloud data acquired by LiDAR to the priori known 3D point cloud map to obtain the position of the vehicle within the map. However, 3D point cloud map is very expensive to store and download as it contains an enormous amount of data even for a small area (around 300 million points per km<sup>2</sup>). In this study, rather than using 3D point cloud directly as a map, we focused on the planar surfaces which are mostly available in urban areas, easy to extract, and at the same time clearly observable by LiDAR. Therefore, in our proposed map, we extract the planar surfaces from the 3D point cloud and calculate its uncertainty (deviation) and store them as a prior map. Accordingly, in this map, we can abstract several thousands of points by only one plane. As a result, we can extremely shrink the map size (25 million points to around 1000 planes). Later in the localization phase, we reconstruct Gaussian mixture model for each planar surface based on previously stored deviation, and match LiDAR data to it to obtain the precise location of the vehicle. Experiments conducted in one of the urban areas of Tokyo show that even though we extremely shrank the map size, we could preserve the mean error of the localization less than 43cm comparing to other point cloud based methods.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317840","LiDAR;planar surface map;Velodyne;self-localization;urban area","Conferences;Intelligent transportation systems","Gaussian processes;mobile robots;optical radar;position control;robot vision;satellite navigation;SLAM (robots)","probabilistic planar surface map;multichannel LiDAR;urban area;3D light detection;global navigation satellite system;mapping methods;point cloud data;3D point cloud map;prior map;map size;LiDAR data;point cloud based methods;autonomous vehicle self-localization;GNSS;simultaneous localization and mapping methods;SLAM;Gaussian mixture model;Tokyo","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is however still a long way to go before such maturity is seen in autonomous ground vehicles. One of the critical limitations of the existing technology is the inability to navigate complex dynamic traffic scenarios such as non-signalised roundabouts safely, efficiently and while maintaining passenger drive comfort. The navigation at roundabouts has often been considered as either a problem of collision avoidance alone or the problem of efficient driving (reducing congestion). We argue that for any autonomous planning solution to be accepted for replacing the human driver, it has to consider all the three objectives of safety, efficiency and comfort. With human drivers driving these complex and dynamic scenarios for a long time, learning from the human driving has become a promising area of research. In this work, we learn human driver's longitudinal behaviours for driving at a non-signalised roundabout. This knowledge is then used to generate longitudinal behaviour candidate profiles that give the autonomous vehicle different behaviour choices in a dynamic environment. A decision-making algorithm is then employed to tactically select the optimal behaviour candidate based on the existing scenario dynamics. There are two important contributions in this paper, firstly the adaptive longitudinal behaviour candidate generation algorithm and secondly the tactical, risk aware, multi-objective decision-making algorithm. We describe their implementation and compare the autonomous vehicle performance against human driving.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317907","Path Planning;Naturalistic Speed Planning;Behaviour Planning;Trajectories;Situation Awareness;Risk Aware","Autonomous vehicles;Decision making;Indexes;Planning;Navigation;Heuristic algorithms","collision avoidance;decision making;mobile robots;optimisation;road traffic;road vehicles;vehicle dynamics","ground vehicle application;human involvement;driving activity;autonomous ground vehicles;critical limitations;complex dynamic traffic scenarios;nonsignalised roundabout;passenger drive comfort;collision avoidance;autonomous planning solution;human driver;complex scenarios;dynamic scenarios;human driving;dynamic environment;optimal behaviour candidate;adaptive longitudinal behaviour candidate generation algorithm;autonomous vehicle performance;adaptive behaviour selection;naturalistic speed planning","","3","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the ego vehicle (i.e., the vehicle to be controlled) follows a given trajectory, an emergency maneuver should be kept available for all times in order to avoid collisions. However, generating an emergency maneuver for each time step is computationally expensive and often not required. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for determining the maximum time horizon under which the ego vehicle can safely follow a given trajectory. First, an upper and a lower bound of this time horizon are computed. Then, binary search is used to find the maximum time horizon for which safety is still guaranteed. Our algorithm reduces the frequency of generating emergency maneuvers while still guaranteeing collision-free trajectories. The approach is tested on real traffic data, and it is shown that our algorithm indeed reduces the frequency of generating emergency maneuvers compared to previous work.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317696","","Trajectory;Planning;Safety;Conferences;Intelligent transportation systems;Heuristic algorithms;Upper bound","collision avoidance;mobile robots;road safety;trajectory control","emergency maneuver;maximum time horizon;ego vehicle;collision-free trajectories;unknown future behavior;safe trajectories;autonomous vehicles;real traffic data;traffic participants","","","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It also uses the AFS to superimpose an additional angle to the steering column. This allows us to control the hand wheel rotation at different input feedback torque values. We use a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to compute the optimal torque feedback input to the hand wheel along with the commanded AFS superposition angle in both autonomous and assisted driving scenarios. The MPC employs a model of the steering dynamics and a driver steering behavior in order to obtain lesser hand wheel rotation during a same lane change maneuver as compared to a conventional EPAS system without AFS. We also make sure driver torque effort is within allowable limits. We validate the proposed approach by performing simulations for both autonomous and driver assisted scenarios.

Accurate extrinsic calibration is required to compute metric information. But the task is quite challenging, because of the wide-baseline and the vegetation. Also, pattern-based methods are hardly feasible without disrupting the traffic. Therefore, we propose a points-correspondence-free solution. Our method is fully-automatic and based on a joint analysis of vehicles motion and appearance. Provided the extrinsic calibration estimated, we achieve trajectory reconstruction with a Kalman filter. The tracking strategy relies on the identification of virtual planes tangent to vehicles bumpers. Extensive experiments are carried out in real conditions with a baseline greater than 22 meters.

As in reality, wayfinding is a more complex endeavor, results of studies using both random path or the most optimal shortest path approach might be misleading. In this paper we propose with the exploratory betweenness centrality (EBC) a more realistic set of measures that uses an exploratory path in calculating centrality rather than an optimal path in studying pedestrian movement. In particular we calculate EBC where the agent selects the longest street nearest to the destination (App-EBC) or any random street that is approaching the destination (Ran-EBC). In doing so, we compare how EBC and GBC correlate with aggregate pedestrian movement for two case studies in London. The result shows the EBC measures explains equal or greater variation of aggregate pedestrian movement than the GBC measure for both of the case studies, indicating the potential of using measures of EBC in modeling urban mobility.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317950","Street networks;space syntax;wayfinding;shortest path;spatial cognition;betweenness centrality;urban mobility","Conferences;Aggregates;Syntactics;Measurement;Roads;Cognition;Histograms","network theory (graphs);pedestrians","exploratory betweenness centrality;London;GBC measure;EBC measures;case studies;aggregate pedestrian movement;Ran-EBC;random street;App-EBC;longest street;optimal path;exploratory path;optimal shortest path approach;random path;complex endeavor;human wayfinding procedures;Dijkstra shortest path;spatial street network;urban mobility;urban studies;network sciences;street network level","","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, accurate positioning (e.g., with lane level accuracy) is very difficult to obtain due to lack of measurements with high confidence, especially in an environment without full access to a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). In this paper, a novel information fusion algorithm based on a particle filter (PF) is proposed to achieve lane level tracking accuracy under a GNSS-denied environment. We consider the use of both large scale and small scale signal measurements for positioning. Time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements using the radio frequency signals from known transmitters or roadside units, and acceleration or gyroscope measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) allow us to form a coarse estimate of the vehicle position using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Subsequently, small scale measurements such as lane-change detection, radar ranging from the guardrails and information from a high resolution digital map are incorporated to refine the position estimates using a PF. A probabilistic model is introduced to characterize the lane changing behaviors and a multi-hypothesis model is formulated for the radar range measurements to robustly weight the particles and refine the tracking results. The performance of the proposed tracking framework is verified by simulations using a four-lane highway.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317659","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317659","","Radar tracking;Atmospheric measurements;Position measurement;Particle measurements;Global navigation satellite system;Acceleration","gyroscopes;inertial navigation;Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;object detection;object tracking;particle filtering (numerical methods);probability;radar detection;radar tracking;radionavigation;road vehicles;sensor fusion;traffic engineering computing","intelligent transportation applications;accurate positioning;global navigation satellite system;GNSS;information fusion algorithm;particle filter;lane level tracking accuracy;scale signal measurements;time-of-arrival measurements;radio frequency signals;roadside units;inertial measurement unit;vehicle position;extended Kalman filter;scale measurements;lane-change detection;high resolution digital map;lane changing behaviors;radar range measurements;four-lane highway;vehicle tracking;vehicle positioning;gyroscope measurements;probabilistic model","","1","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, wireless communication technologies that are currently available for vehicles usually have unique sets of limitations in terms of latency, throughput, and/or signal propagation characteristics. A promising solution to break through these limitations is hybrid vehicular networking, in which on-board units in vehicles concurrently make use of multiple types of radios (e.g., DSRC, Wi-Fi, LTE, etc.), dynamically selecting the most suitable network interface(s) according to the performance requirements and network conditions. In this paper, we explore the potential of a quasi-centralized approach to hybrid vehicular networking. Vehicles opportunistically report their positions and channel load measurements to a cloud-based central server when they have access to network infrastructure (e.g., roadside units). Analyzing the wide-scale statistics on road and network conditions, the server derives and distributes recommended network selection strategy for each geographical region, allowing vehicles to make globally-optimized network selection.

From the perspective of priority level, feasible avoidance behaviour for critical crossing conflict was discussed in this paper with particular emphasis on swerving direction. To that end, a driving simulation experiment was conducted concerning how situational parameters of the conflict scenario relate to drivers' avoidance manoeuvre. The results proved the existence of drivers' same-direction-pattern (SDP) of their swerving manoeuvre.

Drivers' anticipation was abstracted as latent variable. Its hypothetic relationships with external stimulus the drivers perceive and their responses were formulated under the framework of structural equation model. The model was estimated based on the vehicle trajectory and field observation data.

However, these improvements in crash worthiness do little to protect other vulnerable road users such as pedestrians or bicyclists. Several manufacturers have developed a new generation of crash avoidance systems that attempt to recognize and mitigate imminent crashes with non-motorists. While the focus of these systems has been on pedestrians where they can make meaningful contributions to improved safety [1], recent designs of these systems have recognized mitigating bicyclist crashes as a potential co-benefit. This paper evaluates the performance of one system that is currently available for consumer purchase. Because the vehicle manufacturer does not claim effectiveness for their system under all crash geometries, we focus our attention on the crash scenario that has the highest social cost in the US: the cyclist and vehicle on parallel paths being struck from behind. Our analysis of co benefits examines the ability to reduce three measures: number of crashes, fatalities, and a comprehensive measure for social cost that incorporates morbidity and mortality. Test track simulations under realistic circumstances with a realistic surrogate bicyclist target are conducted. Empirical models are developed for system performance and potential benefits for injury and fatality reduction. These models identify three key variables in the analysis: vehicle speed, cyclist speed and cyclist age as key determinants of potential co-benefits.

Its ability to simulate real events in order to study perception and behaviour has led to safer and more controlled environments. In our study, an Immersive Head Mounted Virtual Reality (IHMVR) device is used to evaluate pedestrian crossing behaviour when 1) pedestrians are not distracted, 2) pedestrians are distracted with a hand held device, and 3) a safety measure is implemented on the road for distracted pedestrians with a hand held device. The proposed safety measure aims to alert distracted pedestrian by flashing LED lights on the crosswalk when pedestrian initiated crossing. A group of 25 students from Montréal, Canada, participated in the three crossing scenarios and their wait time, crossing time, speed, and acceleration were collected. For the safety analysis, both Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Post-Encroachment-Time (PET) surrogate measures were computed. The design and development of the road crossing implemented in the IHMVR is based on an existing road crossing in Montréal and its real time traffic information. The results from our study indicated safer crossing decisions from non-distracted pedestrian, compared to distracted pedestrian. The scenario with the implemented preventative measure did not improve safety, however it increased the successful crossing rate. Wait time for non-distracted pedestrian was shorter compared to distracted pedestrians who took longer to identify a safe crossing gap and initiate crossing. The crossing speed for distracted pedestrians with no safety countermeasure was higher due to their poor crossing choice compared to non-distracted participants.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317769","distracted pedestrians street crossing;cell phone use;immersive virtual reality;surrogate analysis","Solid modeling;Safety;Roads;Virtual reality;Automobiles;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","helmet mounted displays;pedestrians;road accidents;road safety;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;virtual reality","nondistracted pedestrian;distracted pedestrian;wait time;crossing speed;distracted pedestrians crossing;pedestrian crossing behaviour;safety measure;Montréal;crossing scenarios;crossing time;road crossing;immersive head mounted virtual reality device;crossing decisions;time-to-collision;post-encroachment-time;PET surrogate measures;Canada","","1","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, planning multi-modal journeys is still an unstructured and time-consuming experience for customers: they lose time assembling a comprehensive plan out of disparate data, spread over a multitude of information systems - each corresponding to a different company responsible for one of the legs in the journey. Also transport operators are affected by the sparsity of the transportation market, as they might lose potential customers who could not find or know about their services. In this paper, we propose Mobility as a Service (MaaS) as a solution to such problems. Key element of MaaS is that MaaS operators can aggregate solutions of multiple providers to deliver dynamic, transparent multi-modal travels to their users, who experience transportation as managed directly by a single operator. However, given the volume and sparsity of the transportation market, we argue that MaaS operators cannot rely on one-to-one, custom contracts of usage with single mobility operators. Instead, we envision the creation of platforms that automatise the marketing of services for mobility among many mobility providers. In this work, we detail the required features of a general software platform for such a MaaS market. In particular, we provide a precise definition of MaaS through the MaaS Stack - a tiered view of the components needed by entities to join the MaaS market. Then, through the lens of the MaaS Stack, we elicit the features of an enabling software platform. Finally, to validate our approach, we present a compliant prototype, called SMAll, and discuss its main design choices, among which: i) how SMAll supports the creation of a federation-based MaaS market and ii) how microservices - an emerging architectural style that fosters cohesiveness and minimality of components - enhance flexibility and let the platform and the services of its members efficiently scale according to dynamic demands.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317701","Mobility as a Service;Microservices;Federated Platforms","Delays;Legged locomotion;Real-time systems;Companies;Contracts;Automobiles","Internet;mobile computing;service-oriented architecture;traffic information systems;transportation;Web services","unstructured time;comprehensive plan;transport operators;sparsity;transportation market;potential customers;MaaS operators;single operator;single mobility operators;mobility providers;transparent multimodal travels;marketing;multimodal journeys;multimodal travelling;mobility-as-a-service operators;global federated market;smart mobility;MaaS Stack;MaaS market","","1","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This model could deal with the scenarios under practical constraints such as journey time, route altitude and speed limits. Thus, the model proposed in this paper is able to locate the speed trajectory with minimum energy consumption for practical train operation. Compared with previous research, the previous study could merely deal with monotonous trajectory, but the model in this paper has no such constraints and it able to deal with more complicated application scenarios. Model using mixed integer linear programming method is robust and adaptive in managing constraints. In future work, more constraints such as battery characteristic and motor efficiency will be considered in the model.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317807","","Trajectory;Traction motors;Energy consumption;Acceleration;Mathematical model;Force;Intelligent transportation systems","integer programming;linear programming;railway rolling stock;regenerative braking","practical train operation;optimal trajectory;rail vehicle traction system;energy efficiency;regenerative braking method;rail transportation;energy conservation;energy demand;speed trajectory optimization model;monotonous trajectory;minimum energy consumption;practical constraints;mixed integer linear programming method;braking distance","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead of modeling precise vehicle dynamics, which strongly restricts the planning horizon that can be considered in real-time, we use a simplified second-order integrator model which is constrained to match the vehicle's feasible dynamic envelope. Moreover, and contrary to many MPC approaches taking a target speed as input, our formulation also includes velocity planning, making the vehicle able to automatically adjust its speed to the layout of the road. Simulation results on a highly precise vehicle model show that our approach can be used in real-time to provide feasible trajectories that can be tracked using a simple control architecture. Moreover, the use of our simplified model makes the planner more robust and yields better trajectories compared to kinematic models commonly used in trajectory planning.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317632","","Wheels;Vehicle dynamics;Trajectory;Planning;Computational modeling;Roads;Mathematical model","mobile robots;optimal control;path planning;predictive control;road vehicles;trajectory control;vehicle dynamics;velocity control","model predictive control;vehicle dynamics;control architecture;dynamic envelope;high-speed trajectory planning;predetermined path;simple dynamic model;autonomous vehicles;velocity planning;target speed;MPC approaches;second-order integrator model;planning horizon","","4","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent research has shown the possibility of using near-collisions in order to estimate the frequency of actual collisions using Extreme Value Theory. In order to trust these estimations, the precision of these estimates needs to be validated.

Among conventional image processing algorithms deployed, optical flow is an appropriate approach towards the latter task, that is affected by translation and rotation of the ego vehicle.

An estimation engine is developed according to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) theory, that tries to estimate the real state of the multi-region dynamic system based on sparse traffic sensors measurements. First, a stochastic model is presented for the dynamics of the process (plant). Then, the EKF estimation scheme is described that is based on a simpler aggregated model of the dynamics and some real-time measurements. The accuracy of the estimations is investigated through simulation by studying a realistic configuration of real-time availability of measurements; however the developed methodology is generic and the vector state we seek to estimate as well as the available measurements can be altered according to the application. The resulting estimated traffic states (i.e., regional accumulations, demands, and distribution of outflows) are compared to the real ones that are obtained from the stochastic plant. The developed algorithm can be utilized by closed-loop online urban traffic management strategies to feed back to the controller the estimated traffic state.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317850","","Estimation;Real-time systems;Vehicle dynamics;Mathematical model;Kalman filters;Engines;Current measurement","Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;road traffic control;state estimation;stochastic processes","stochastic model;EKF estimation scheme;simpler aggregated model;real-time measurements;estimations;vector state;regional accumulations;closed-loop online urban traffic management strategies;aggregated traffic states;multiregion urban networks;traffic state estimation;large-scale urban networks;aggregated traffic dynamics;vehicle accumulation;neighbouring regions;real-time estimation problem;estimation engine;Extended Kalman Filter theory;multiregion dynamic system;sparse traffic sensors measurements;real-time estimation;estimated traffic states","","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One-way carsharing is a most recent and popular kind of shared mobility, that is growing and developing rapidly in various forms. These systems are considered to have a transformative impact on future urban transportation. Despite all of the benefits that have been reported from the use of new one-way carsharing (e.g. Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand systems), their impacts on the mobility are not certain yet. This comes from the fact that in such services supply and demand influence each other in a significant way in short-, mid-, and long-term. Also service characteristics at the level of each vehicle strongly affect the demand. In this paper methods, paradigms, toolkits and platforms used in the literature for the demand estimation of the new one-way carsharing systems, as well as their potential drawbacks are discussed. A review of the literature reveals that despite the considerable number of studies related to balancing vehicle stocks across stations in one-way systems, the investigation about demand estimation of such services for which the complex relationship between supply and demand is considered, remain very limited. The majority of current platforms and toolkits used for demand estimation of new one-way carsharing systems are based on activity-based multi-agent simulations. In these simulations several main components are not yet taken into account, which could dramatically change the results. Data detail, accessibility and reliability, high computational time, calibration and validation still remain major challenges for travel demand estimation for one-way carsharing systems.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317917","Carsharing;Shared Autonomous Vehicle;Shared Mobility;Free-floating;Station-based;Travel demand estimation;Agent-base simulation;Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand;Shared-use vehicle systems","Estimation;Computational modeling;Automobiles;Conferences;Reliability;Autonomous vehicles","multi-agent systems;transportation;travel industry","Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand systems;multi-agent simulations;shared mobility;private mobility;one-way carsharing systems;travel demand estimation","","","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel control method is introduced, which is specifically designed for maintaining efficient traffic control while adding stability to the control plan. The method is an extension to the current adaptive algorithm. The results show a large improvement between static and actuated control with 19% reduction of negative impact, and a further 11% reduction is achieved with adaptive control.

Due to the uneven distribution of the passenger flows, only operating full-length train services from the origin station to the destination station is not sufficient, especially for the central business district (CBD) areas during peak hours, where the load factors of train services could reach 100% or even 120%. Meanwhile, only operating full-length train services could result in the lack of rolling stocks because of the long cycling time. The short turning strategy can be adopted to enhance the passengers' satisfaction and reducing their waiting time.

This study evaluates the widely applied shortest path assumption and so user equilibrium state from two aspects; (i) user perspective: similarity between actual and shortest paths, (ii) network perspective: node loads that result from actual and shortest paths. This study uses the GPS trajectory data set of approximately 20,000 taxis from Shenzhen, China to estimate the travel costs and reveal the actual routes followed in the network. It also considers two types of shortest paths that are based on free flow and estimated travel time. User perspective analysis concludes that most travellers do not choose the shortest path based on neither free flow nor estimated travel time. On the other hand, network perspective examination demonstrates similar network-wide patterns with actual routes and shortest paths based on estimated travel time.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317669","","Public transportation;Roads;Global Positioning System;Biological system modeling;Urban areas;Conferences","Global Positioning System;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;transportation","GPS trajectory data;network perspective examination;traffic control strategy;infrastructure initiative;traffic conditions;road infrastructure","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, a connected ecodriving system for EVs is designed and evaluated with real-world test driving data. It is implemented in two stages: 1) driving assistance where the recommended instantaneous speed is presented to the driver via an on-board display; and 2) automatic longitudinal control where a model predictive controller (MPC) is developed to control the vehicle's longitudinal speed by following the trajectory reference. The system performance (in terms of energy and mobility) for both stages is compared with the baseline stage where no EAD assistance is provided.

Autonomous vehicles should also manage these situations by behaving cooperatively and naturally. The challenge of cooperative driving is estimating other vehicles' intentions. In this paper, we present a novel method to estimate other human-driven vehicles' intentions with the aim of achieving a natural and amenable cooperative driving behavior, without using wireless communication. The new approach allows the autonomous vehicle to cooperate with multiple observable merging vehicles on the ramp with a leading vehicle ahead of the autonomous vehicle in the same lane. To avoid calculating trajectories, simplify computation, and take advantage of mature Level-3 components, the new method reacts to merging cars by determining a following target for an off-the-shelf distance keeping module (ACC) which governs speed control of the autonomous vehicle. We train and evaluate the proposed model using real traffic data. Results show that the new approach has a lower collision rate than previous methods and generates more human driver-like behaviors in terms of trajectory similarity and time-to-collision to leading vehicles.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317887","","Merging;Autonomous vehicles;Automobiles;Computational modeling;Estimation;Trajectory;Autonomous automobiles","automobiles;driver information systems;mobile robots;remotely operated vehicles;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","interactive ramp merging planning;autonomous driving;driving behavior;autonomous vehicle;human-driven vehicles;multiple observable merging vehicles;leading vehicle;merging cars;multimerging leading PGM;ACC","","4","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Continuous online camera calibration is key to enable a long maintenance-free operation of autonomous vehicles. Conventional algorithms for online calibration usually assume a static world. This, however, is often violated in urban scenarios. In this paper an algorithm is presented that determines the twelve degrees-of-freedom (12-DoF) extrinsic calibration of a stereo camera system in dynamic, urban scenarios. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) continuously estimates the extrinsic stereo camera calibration by tracking the position of salient points in 3D space that are observed in both cameras. The EKF predicts the 3D position of tracked points based on the estimated calibration and the vehicle's motion, which is estimated using an inertial navigation system (INS) and odometry sensors. However, only static points can be reliable predicted. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to segment camera images on a pixel level. These segmented images are further converted to binary images labeling static and potentially dynamic pixels. Only salient points which are labeled as static are retained for estimation of the stereo camera calibration. While the stereo camera's extrinsic parameters are only observable under transformation and two independent rotations of the vehicle, we present a robust filter update scheme, that enables estimation of the 12-DoF extrinsic stereo camera calibration even in the absence of significant rotations. Test on urban roads show that minor road imperfections are sufficient to estimate all 12-DoF extrinsic parameters over time.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317675","","Cameras;Calibration;Heuristic algorithms;Robot vision systems;Three-dimensional displays;Vehicle dynamics;Prediction algorithms","calibration;cameras;computer vision;image reconstruction;image segmentation;image sensors;inertial navigation;Kalman filters;mobile robots;neural nets;nonlinear filters;robot vision;stereo image processing;tracking","static points;segment camera images;static pixels;potentially dynamic pixels;salient points;12-DoF extrinsic stereo camera calibration;12-DoF extrinsic parameters;continuous stereo camera calibration;urban scenarios;stereo images;continuous online camera calibration;long maintenance-free operation;online calibration;stereo camera system;dynamic scenarios;estimated calibration;odometry sensors","","1","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In line with existing work, a station based model is used to represent the movement of passengers and vehicles in an urban environment. The problem of how to best route vehicles, to minimizes either (i) the total system travel time, (ii) total passenger travel time, or (iii) a weighted combination of the two, is given as the solution of a integer linear program. The formulation captures the need to rebalance vehicles from popular destination stations to popular origin stations. Moreover, it allows trips to be chained together, such that a passenger may board a vehicle with one passenger already on board. Theoretical results address the stability of such systems in terms of fleet size and characteristics of the travel demand.

The larger the V2V-based clusters are, the higher the data compression ratio at the cluster head is, and the smaller the amount of required resource on the cellular link becomes. However, PLR becomes higher due to the collisions on the V2V channel when increasing the number of hops for cluster enlargement. The proposed algorithm thus dynamically adapts the maximum number of hops in clusters according to the vehicular traffic density.

Motivated by the dominant performance of convolution neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory neural networks (LSTMs), and with consideration of the spatial-temporal features, this study attempts to develop a hybrid deep learning framework fusing CNNs and LSTMs to forecast the travel time on urban expressways. A 2-dimension deep CNNs is exploited to capture spatial features of traffic states, and LSTMs are utilized to excavate the temporal correlation of travel time series. Then, these spatial-temporal features are fed into a linear regression layer. The travel time forecasting is achieved by fusing these abstract traffic features in a hybrid deep learning framework.

It has attracted increasing amounts of attention due to the rapidly-increasing number of vehicles. Identification of two vehicles of the same model is even more difficult than the identification of identical twin humans. Further-more, there is no vehicle re-identification dataset that considers the interference caused by the presence of other vehicles of the same model. Therefore, to provide a fair comparison and facilitate future research into vehicle re-identification, this paper constructs a new dataset called the vehicle re-identification dataset-1 (<sup>1</sup> VRID-1). VRID-1 contains 10,000 images captured in daytime of 1,000 individual vehicles of the ten most common vehicle models. For each vehicle model, there are 100 individual vehicles, and for each of these, there are ten images captured at different locations. The images in VRID-1 were captured by 326 surveillance cameras, and thus there are various vehicles poses and levels of illumination. Yet, it provides images of good enough quality for the evaluation of vehicle re-identification in a practical surveillance environment. In addition, according to the characteristics of vehicle morphology, this paper proposes a deep learning-based method to extract multi-dimensional robust features for vehicle re-identification using convolutional neural networks.

A commonly used method to solve this problem is the Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM), which could alleviate or even eliminate the perspective effect. However, it is time-consuming due to the interpolation operation. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to reduce the perspective distortion of road markings. First, we reconstruct the road images by changing the viewpoint, as if they are captured by the camera right in front of the road markings in each lane. Second, Region of Interest (ROI) of each lane could be confirmed in its corresponding image. The proposed method could provide a fast and stable view of road markings and make them easy to detect and recognize. The experiments on a road image dataset demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is much faster than IPM while maintaining the comparable accuracy in road marking recognition.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317821","Road marking recognition;Perspective distortion;Inverse Perspective Mapping","Roads;Cameras;Image reconstruction;Image recognition;Distortion;Mathematical model;Conferences","cameras;image recognition;interpolation;road vehicles","Inverse Perspective Mapping;road image dataset;road marking recognition;ROI;region of interest;interpolation operation;autonomous vehicles;fast reducing perspective distortion","","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a driver model learned from demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning is used to equip a host vehicle with the anticipatory behavior reasoning capability of common drivers. Second, inference on an interaction-aware augmented Switching State-Space Model allows the approach to account for the dynamic evidence observed. The use of a driver model that correctly balances the driving and risk-aversive preferences of a driver allows the computation of a planning-based maneuver prediction. Integrating this anticipatory prediction into the maneuver inference engine brings a degree of scene understanding into the estimate and leads to faster lane change detections compared to those obtained by relying on dynamics alone. The performance of the presented framework is evaluated using highway data collected with an instrumented vehicle. The combination of model-based maneuver prediction and filtering-based state and maneuver tracking is shown to outperform an Interacting Multiple Model filter in the detection of highway lane change maneuvers regarding accuracy, detection latency - by an average of 0.4 seconds- and false-positive rates.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317709","","Vehicles;Predictive models;Vehicle dynamics;Road transportation;Switches;Hidden Markov models;Cost function","inference mechanisms;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic;road vehicles","highway lane change maneuvers;interaction-aware driver maneuver inference;realistic driver models;lane change maneuver prediction;highway scenarios;perception systems;automated driving;prediction approach;driver model;Inverse Reinforcement Learning;host vehicle;anticipatory behavior reasoning capability;risk-aversive preferences;anticipatory prediction;maneuver inference engine;faster lane change detections;filtering-based state;maneuver tracking;Interacting Multiple Model filter;interaction-aware augmented Switching State-Space Model","","1","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cameras are particularly suited for this task, as the traffic relevant information of a scene is inferable from its visual appearance. In traffic scene understanding, semantic segmentation denotes the task of generating and labeling regions in the image that correspond to specific object categories, such as cars or road area. In contrast, the task of scene recognition assigns a global label to an image, that reflects the overall category of the scene. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN) capable of solving both problems in a computationally efficient manner. The architecture is designed to avoid redundant computations, as the task specific decoders share a common feature encoder stage.

This trajectory will serve as an intermediate reference trajectory for the vehicle in the next few seconds.

Results are obtained based on evaluating the proposed leader-following approach in a test containing sharp turns and a zig-zag pattern in the trajectory, and variation in the speed of the leader robot.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317748","","Trajectory;Estimation;Robot kinematics;Cameras;Tracking;Robot sensing systems","mobile robots;multi-robot systems;object tracking;path planning;probability;robot vision;trajectory control","probabilistic trajectory estimation;virtual train model;tracking control;vision detection;vision occlusion;time-varying linear velocity;intermittent inter-robot relative observations;trajectory tracking;multi-robot leader-following approach;motion blurring;leader robot trajectory;noise-corrupted odometry information;fiducial marker detection;RGBD camera","","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the most popular form of car sharing, one-way car sharing, still suffers from the vehicle unbalance problem. Innovative solutions to this issue rely on custom vehicles with stackable capabilities: customers or operators can drive a train of vehicles if necessary, thus efficiently bringing several cars from an area with few requests to an area with many requests. However, how to model a car sharing system with stackable vehicles is an open problem in the related literature. In this paper, we propose a queueing theoretical model to fill this gap, and we use this model to derive an upper-bound on user-based relocation capabilities. We also validate, for the first time in the related literature, legacy queueing theoretical models against a trace of real car sharing data. Finally, we present preliminary results about the impact, on car availability, of simple user-based relocation heuristics with stackable vehicles. Our results indicate that user-based relocation schemes that exploit vehicle stackability can significantly improve car availability at stations.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317752","","Automobiles;Queueing analysis;Delays;Mathematical model;Conferences;Urban areas","automobiles;queueing theory;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","car sharing system;shared stackable vehicles;vehicle unbalance problem;stackable capabilities;cars;queueing theoretical model;user-based relocation capabilities;legacy queueing theoretical models;vehicle stackability","","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed EF relay forwards the unconstrained minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the received signal at the relay node (vehicle/infrastructure) to the destination node (vehicle/infrastructure), which outperforms amplify-and-forward (AF) in terms of performance, and achieves lower complexity than decode-and-forward (DF).

Therefore tactical behaviour planning with respect to the intentions of the surrounding road users is an essential functionality at the maneuver level. Moreover, the incorporation of uncertainty in road users intentions and sensor measurements is of high importance, especially in urban scenarios. This paper presents a generalized approach towards high level decision making for automated vehicles encountering by formulating the problem as a continuous Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) by combining the advantage of two state of the art solvers - MCVI and SARSOP.

A transition process to a private vehicle dependent society could be found in many cities because local authority doesn't have appropriate planning to anticipate it while earlier studies also clearly identified that some countries has already finish the transition process from of the vehicle ownership such as Japan and Korea. This paper aims to analyze influential factors on transition phenomena of vehicle ownership by applying ordered logit model which consider socio-economic and geographical aspects. The empirical case study was conducted based on face to face interview survey in 2015 of 600 household in Bogor city Indonesia. The transition process of vehicle ownership could be obtained from aggregate data that show several type of ownership such as non-vehicle owner, single motorcycle, multiple motorcycle and multiple vehicle or combination of private car and motorcycle. The estimation was calculated by econometric software LIMDEP. It shows a robust and reliable estimation result. We found a clear and significant transition process which shown as estimated coefficient for different group of vehicle owner. The ordered logit model also be able to explore influential factors on vehicle ownership. First, household income and home ownership give positive influence on vehicle ownership. In contrast, age; education level; family size and residential location give negative influence on vehicle ownership. Household living in central business area did not indicate an interest in owning a private vehicle. The study also found a rapid growth of household income within last 10 years which may increase vehicle population and change its composition in next near future in Bogor city. Local policy makers should therefore aware on this situation and prepare appropriate action to control vehicle population and its use. The revitalization of central business district and its public transport system could play significant role to control vehicle ownership in Bogor city.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317966","motorization;vehicle ownership;ordered logit;Bogor city Indonesia","Automobiles;Motorcycles;Urban areas;Sociology;Statistics;Agriculture;Conferences","automobiles;econometrics;environmental economics;land use planning;public transport;regression analysis;road traffic;socio-economic effects","private vehicle dependent society;Asian city;Bogor city;Indonesia;socio-economic aspects;public transport service authority;motorization;ordered logit model;geographical aspects;LIMDEP econometric software;central business district revitalization;vehicle population control;vehicle ownership transition process planning","","1","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering the fact that the calibration is formulated as a non-linear least-square problem, the method is based on the analysis of the cost function properties in the neighborhood of the solution.

It has been shown to reduce GNSS error from several meters to sub-meter level by matching the biased GNSS positioning of four vehicles to a digital map with road constraints in our previous work. While further error reduction is expected by increasing the number of participating vehicles, fundamental questions on how the vehicle membership of the CMM affects the performance of the GNSS-based localization results need to be addressed to provide guidelines for design and optimization of the vehicle network. The quantitative relationship between the estimation error and the road constraints has to be systematically investigated to provide insights. In this work, a theoretical study is presented that aims at developing a framework for quantitatively evaluating effects of the road constraints on the CMM accuracy and for eventual optimization of the CMM network. More specifically, a closed-form expression of the CMM error in terms of the road angles and GNSS error is first derived based on a simple CMM rule.

For acquiring the traffic conditions of the preceding road section, a road-speed profile is proposed, which is dynamically updated using limited V2V data in a bi-level approximation framework. In the lower level of the framework, the state of the known vehicles within the communication range are predicted in a short horizon using a conditional persistence prediction model. The model parameter is determined by fitting with the experimental driving data. In the upper level, the time, position and speed of the vehicles obtained from the lower level are then mapped onto the road, which is represented by a sequence of connected cells.

Speed and steering angle which reflect the longitudinal and lateral behavior of drivers are two important parameters for behavior prediction. However, traditional behavior learning methods, especially the methods based on artificial neural networks rely on the human-selected features, and thus have poor adaptability to the highly changeable traffic environment. This paper aims to overcome this drawback by using deep learning which can learn features automatically from the driving data without human interventions. Specifically, the deep belief network (DBN) is used to build the learning model, and the training data are collected from drivers driving on the real-world road. Based on the model, the steering angle of the front wheel and the speed of vehicle are predicted. The prediction results show that, compared with the traditional learning method, DBN has a higher accuracy and can adapt to different driving scenarios with much less modifications.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317929","vehicle;driving behavior prediction;DBN;deep learning","Neural networks;Vehicles;Data models;Wheels;Predictive models;Training;Conferences","belief networks;driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;road safety;road traffic","lateral behavior;drivers;behavior prediction;traditional behavior;artificial neural networks;human-selected features;highly changeable traffic environment;deep learning;driving data;human interventions;deep belief network;learning model;steering angle;prediction results;traditional learning method;different driving scenarios;intelligent vehicles;human driving behavior;advanced driving assistance systems;DBN;real-world road;longitudinal behavior","","1","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome this problem, we proposed behavioral trajectory planning which generates a macro-scale trajectory to define a spatiotemporal boundary of vehicle motion. This planner focuses on searching for a driving maneuver considering lane structure and traffic flow. As a result, this trajectory can reduce a searching area to generate a motion-level trajectory.

By using a virtual environment that has been constructed from high-fidelity measurements of a real world scenario, we are able to establish a direct link between real and virtual world sensor data.

While approaches to object detection have experienced tremendous improvements since the introduction and combination of region proposal and convolutional neural networks in one framework, the detection of distant objects occupying just a few pixels in images can be challenging though. The convolutional and pooling layers reduce the image information to feature maps; yet, relevant information may be lost through pooling and convolution for small objects. In order to address this challenge, a new approach to proposing regions is presented that extends the architecture of a region proposal network by incorporating priors to guide the proposals towards regions containing potential target objects. Moreover, inspired by the concept of saliency, a saliency-based prior is chosen to guide the RPN towards important regions in order to make efficient use of differences between objects and background in an unsupervised fashion. This allows the network not only to consider local information provided by the convolutional layers, but also to take into account global information provided by the saliency priors. Experimental results based on a distant vehicle dataset and different configurations including three priors show that the incorporation of saliency-inspired priors into a region proposal network can improve its performance significantly.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317756","","Proposals;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Visualization;Conferences;Intelligent transportation systems;Object detection","convolution;driver information systems;feedforward neural nets;object detection","convolutional layers;pooling layers;image information;proposing regions;CNN based object detection;convolutional neural networks;target objects;saliency-guided region proposal network;environmental robust sensing;driver assistance systems;saliency-based prior;RPN;local information;global information;distant object detection;image pixels;distant vehicle dataset","","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, developing a smartphone-based vehicle speed estimation system could improve the performance of the MOD services, and an independent smartphone-based application without any connection with the car also satisfies the convenience demand of MOD service applications.

In our system, we extract the features of interest and detect the lane markings or foreground regions in each frame. We develop a spatio-temporal incremental clustering algorithm coupled with curve fitting for detecting the lanes on-the-fly. The spatio-temporal incremental clustering is performed over the detected foreground region for finding the lanes accurately. Each cluster represents a lane across space and time. The lanes are then identified by fitting curves on these clusters. Our system is capable of accurately detecting straight and curved lanes, non-continuous and continuous lanes and is independent of number of lanes in the frame and the system is fast because we have not used any database for processing the images.

Traffic congestion forecasts estimate an increase of about 60% in 2030. At present, poor choice of signal timings by isolated intersection controllers cause traffic delays that have enormous negative impacts on the economy and environment. Signal timings can be improved by using vehicles' GPS information to overcome the control action deficit at isolated intersections. This new signal control algorithm is beneficial for traffic engineers and governmental agencies, as traffic flow can be optimised and, hence, fuel consumption and emissions decreased. Under the open European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) framework, a traffic responsive GPS based vehicle actuation algorithm (GPS-VA) is proposed. GPS-VA uses position and heading data from vehicle status broadcasts, and inferred velocity information to determine vehicle queue lengths and detect vehicles passing through the intersection. The gathered information is then used to actuate intersection signal timings. Microscopic simulations comparing GPS-VA to fixed-time control and inductive loop based vehicle actuation (Loop-VA) on four urban road networks were performed to see how the proposed GPS-VA algorithm performs compared to existing control strategies. The results show that GPS-VA is an effective alternative to traditional intersection control strategies, offering delay reductions of up to 50% for connected vehicle fleet penetrations above 30%.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317795","","Global Positioning System;Roads;Junctions;Delays;Standards;Receivers","Global Positioning System;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic control;traffic engineering computing","traffic responsive intersection control algorithm;GPS data;vehicle GPS information;inductive loop based control;isolated intersection controllers;traffic delays;traffic engineers;traffic responsive GPS based vehicle actuation algorithm;vehicle status broadcasts;vehicle queue lengths;fixed-time control;inductive loop based vehicle actuation;GPS-VA algorithm;vehicle fleet penetrations;governmental agencies;fuel consumption;ETSI;CAM;cooperative awareness message framework;microscopic simulations;Loop-VA;urban road networks;open European telecommunication standards institute;signalised intersection control performance","","","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rather than being anonymous, the population is described by a distribution over the type parameter (that can be supported on any compact interval of the real line). At equilibria, no member of the population can improve their type dependent cost either by switching sets of routes or by switching routes within their chosen set. From this equilibrium condition, we derive how the population mass will divide up among the various routing options.

This article presents an approach to cooperative intention detection of starting cyclists using smart devices and infrastructure-based sensors. A smart device is carried by the cyclists and the infrastructure is equipped with a wide angle stereo camera system. The approach is based on a two-stage cooperative intention detection process consisting of a movement primitive detection in the first stage, used to recognize the current movement type, and a trajectory forecast in the second stage. In the first stage, cooperation is conducted by means of a stacking ensemble on the level of detected movement primitives. These cooperatively detected movement primitives are used in the second stage in an adaptive gating function that weights between multiple specialized forecasting models. Our cooperative method yields an earlier detection of starting motions compared to a non cooperative approach while retaining robustness. Moreover, we also show that the cooperative method using multiple models is able to reduce the effective forecasting error, reaching the same performance as the system with perfect movement primitive classification.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317691","","Trajectory;Smart devices;Intelligent sensors;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Cameras","cameras;driver information systems;road traffic control;road vehicles;stereo image processing","smart device;situation prediction;starting cyclists;wide angle stereo camera system;movement primitive detection;multiple specialized forecasting models;starting motions;perfect movement primitive classification;movement type;cooperative starting intention detection;infrastructure-based sensors;two-stage cooperative intention detection process;adaptive gating function","","3","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While current head pose estimation (HPE) algorithms are suitable for many applications under controlled conditions, the performance drops in driving environments where images commonly have varying illumination, occlusions, and extreme head rotations. It is important to understand the limitations of current HPE algorithms to create computer vision solutions that target in-vehicle applications. This paper analyzes the HPE algorithms OpenFace, IntraFace and ZFace, with images recorded under natural driving environment where the goal is to find consistent conditions that affect the performance of current HPE systems. The key feature of the recordings is the use of a headband with AprilTags, which are used to estimate reference head pose angles. We study the effect of different factors including head pose angles, illumination in the frames and occlusions due to glasses. We identify the range of yaw and pitch rotations for which these HPE algorithms provide reliable estimations. While the HPE algorithms work reasonably well for normal/rimless glasses, occlusion due to thicker glasses is a major problem. We identified frames where all the HPE algorithms failed to provide an estimate. We are releasing the data to serve as a benchmark for future HPE algorithms in naturalistic driving conditions.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317870","","Magnetic heads;Vehicles;Pose estimation;Lighting;Face;Cameras","computer vision;face recognition;feature extraction;pose estimation","naturalistic driving conditions;naturalistic recordings;in-vehicle applications;natural driving environment;head pose estimation","","3","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dynamic programming algorithm is solved by considering four specific types of transitions: transitions between the same gear, coasting in neutral gear, coasting with a gear engaged with no fuel injection and transitions involving gear changes. Simulations are performed on a driving cycle commonly used for testing distribution type of driving. In order to make sure that the truck does not deviate too much from a normal way of driving, restrictions on maximum and minimum allowed velocities are imposed based on statistics from real traffic data.

The usage of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication enables short following distances, thereby increasing road capacity and fuel reduction (especially for trucks). Control designs for CACC use the wirelessly communicated intended acceleration of a preceding vehicle as a feedforward action in a following vehicle. This feedforward action may determine approximately 80% of the total control action. In case of a communication failure, this feedforward is no longer available, and a larger time gap is needed to ensure high performance and robustness in terms of stability and safety. However, such a larger time gap is not instantly realizable. Therefore, a CACC design is needed which is robust against intermittent communication failures. This paper proposes to share model-based predictions of the intended acceleration via V2V communication, which are stored in a buffer of the following vehicle. This buffer is used in case a packet dropout occurs. Further, since the communication frequency is lower than the frequency of the control-platform, this buffer is also used to virtually upgrade the communication frequency. The design has been tested in experimental vehicles and shows an increased control performance, also in periods of packet dropouts.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317758","Model Predictive Control;Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control;Vehicle-to-vehicle communication;Packet loss","Acceleration;Packet loss;Delays;Robustness;Feedforward systems;Frequency control","adaptive control;control system synthesis;feedforward;predictive control;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles;robust control;stability;vehicular ad hoc networks","robust model predictive control;V2V impairments;intermittent communication failures;CACC design;feedforward action;fuel reduction;road capacity;Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication;traffic throughput;adaptive cruise control","","3","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the proposed techniques for addressing the intent prediction problem have been focusing mainly on two methodologies, namely dynamical motion modelling and motion planning. Despite how powerful these techniques are, but they both rely on hand crafting a set of specific features which are scene specific, which in return affects their generalization to unseen scenes which involves VRUs. In this paper a novel end-to-end data-driven approach is proposed for long-term intent prediction of VRUs such as pedestrians in urban traffic environment based solely on their motion trajectories. The intent prediction problem was formulated as a time-series prediction problem, whereas by just observing a short-window sequence of motion trajectory of pedestrians, a forecasting about their future lateral positions can be made up to 4 secs ahead. In the proposed approach, we utilized the widely adopted architecture of recurrent neural networks, Long-Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) architecture to form a deep stacked LSTM network. The proposed stacked LSTM model was evaluated on one of the popular datasets for intent and path prediction of pedestrians in four unique traffic scenarios that involve pedestrians in an urban environment. Our proposed approach demonstrated competent results in comparison to the baseline approaches in terms of long-term prediction with small lateral position error of 0.39 meters, 0.48 meters, 0.46 meters and 0.51 meters respectively in the four scenarios of the testing dataset.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317941","","Trajectory;Predictive models;Recurrent neural networks;Task analysis;Dynamics;Logic gates;Vehicle dynamics","driver information systems;path planning;pedestrians;recurrent neural nets;road traffic","vulnerable road users;VRUs;dynamical motion modelling;motion planning;urban traffic environment;time-series prediction problem;recurrent neural networks;Long-Short Term Memory networks architecture;LSTM model;automated vehicles","","5","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this purpose, 3D road markings from the combination of high-resolution aerial image and Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) are considered as a reference for the registration. For the 3D registration, a method based on a dynamic-size sliding window over each MMS survey is proposed to preserve the registration accuracy.

While the standard describes a systematic process to incorporate functional safety in the development process of Electrical & Electronic (E/E) systems, it fails to address the needs of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) systems. In order to ensure the safety of ADAS and AD systems, it is important to incorporate the changing nature of interactions between the system and the environment, in the safety analysis process for ADAS and AD systems. In this paper, the authors argue the need for a dynamic approach for automotive safety analysis by adapting the tactical safety for ADAS and AD systems depending on the real-time operational capability and real-time ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) rating of a situation, and discuss a framework for this process. The novelty and therefore contribution of this paper lies in the proposed ASIL inspired dynamic tactical safety framework, which evaluates the severity, controllability and exposure ratings in real-time based on the real time values of the various vehicle and environment parameters. These ratings are used to assign a real-time ASIL value which is used to determine the tactical decisions in order to lower the ASIL value in real-time by altering the functional (operational) capability of the system. Furthermore, the framework is explained with the help of a case study based on a combined Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317868","ISO 26262;Tactical decisions;Hazards;HARA","Safety;Real-time systems;Vehicle dynamics;Risk analysis;Task analysis;Accidents","adaptive control;automotive engineering;braking;driver information systems;hazards;ISO standards;risk management;road safety;road vehicles;velocity control","ADAS;AD systems;changing nature;safety analysis process;dynamic approach;automotive safety analysis;real-time operational capability;ASIL inspired dynamic tactical safety framework;time values;tactical decisions;functional capability;dynamic tactical safety decision framework;automated vehicles;international standard ISO 26262;systematic process;functional safety;development process;automotive safety integrity level;risk assessment process;advanced driver assistance systems;automated driving systems;autonomous emergency braking system;automotive hazard analysis and risk assessment;electrical & electronic systems","","","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In emergency situations in particular, it is crucial that feedback controllers steer the vehicle as close as possible to the planned trajectory to remain within a safe corridor. While there exists much work on the design of trajectory and path tracking controllers for vehicles, little work has been done to systematically compare different approaches, especially when considering extreme situations, uncertain parameters, and disturbances. In this work, we compare eight tracking controllers in a systematic way, each of them representing a different controller family.

Forecasting can be useful in order to plan both services and trips. Depending on the considered time horizon, prediction can output average travel demand in the long term while short-term forecasting can be useful in order to match transport supply to real-time demand. This paper investigates the problem of passenger flow forecasting in multimodal transport and considers train stations and bus and tram stops. The aim is to be able to predict the number of passengers entering each station or boarding at each stop. Both long- and short-term forecasting models are developed using machine learning models such as Random Forests (RF), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks as well as calendar models. Forecasting is performed either for the next year (in the case of long-term models) or for the next 15 minutes for train stations and tram stops and within the next 30 minutes for buses, which could be helpful for both passengers and operators. The experiments are carried out on a real 2 year smart card dataset provided by the Transport organization authority of Ile-de-France.

Equipping those systems with multiple fisheye cameras is a common design solution, since fisheye sensors provide a wide field of view at a cost and size comparable with rectilinear cameras. Unfortunately, a straight line in the world corresponds to a segment of conic section in fisheye images, hence the detection of parking lot markings have to deal with non trivial problems. This paper proposes a method that implements the Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform in the space obtained from the reprojection of the fisheye image points in the equivalence sphere. The presented solution allows to identify road marking segments directly on the fisheye image, providing long range accuracy un-like typical bird's-eye view based approaches.

Previous state of the art approaches use sophisticated vehicle behavior model describing these factors and derive the complex trajectory prediction algorithm, which requires a system designer to conduct intensive model optimization for practical use. Our approach is data-driven and simple to use in that it learns complex behavior of the vehicles from the massive amount of trajectory data through deep neural network model. The proposed trajectory prediction method employs the recurrent neural network called long short-term memory (LSTM) to analyze the temporal behavior and predict the future coordinate of the surrounding vehicles. The proposed scheme feeds the sequence of vehicles' coordinates obtained from sensor measurements to the LSTM and produces the probabilistic information on the future location of the vehicles over occupancy grid map. The experiments conducted using the data collected from highway driving show that the proposed method can produce reasonably good estimate of future trajectory.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317943","","Trajectory;Hidden Markov models;Predictive models;Conferences;Computer architecture;Vehicle dynamics;Microprocessors","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;recurrent neural nets;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","occupancy grid map;recurrent neural network;deep neural network model;road structure;vehicle behavior model;probabilistic vehicle trajectory prediction algorithm;traffic rules;driver intention;long short-term memory;highway driving data collection;LSTM training","","11","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among various ADASs, the collision warning system is one of the representative technology and contributed to prevent the accident and mitigate the severity of the accident. However, existing collision warning systems are designed to prevent the forward collision in an uninterrupted flow, so the safety performance in the interrupted flow near intersection have not been intensively studied. In this paper, the safety performance of Camera-Based collision warning system (CBS) and Radar-Based collision warning system (RBS) are evaluated near the intersection. For this, we newly derived the sixteen vehicle-to-vehicle accident scenarios near the intersection with a crash and near-crash data according to the movements of the subject vehicle and the opponent vehicle. Scenarios derived in this paper differs from the derived scenarios in the previous researches by dealing with more various movements of the subject vehicle such as turning movement. With the derived sixteen vehicle-to-vehicle accident scenarios, we evaluate how effectively CBS and RBS work in the intersection accident scenarios. The results show that CBS and RBS cannot prevent the all accident scenarios due to the limited field-of-view. With the 0.7 accident prevention rate, CBS can prevent the accident in five scenarios, and RBS can prevent the accident in four accident scenarios. To prevent all accident scenarios, another system that can detect the vehicle movement with longer range than CBS and RBS is needed. In the future study, communication-based collision warning system will be developed to further improve the safety performance of collision warning system.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317660","intersection accident;collision warning system;CWS;accident scenario","Accidents;Turning;Alarm systems;Radar;Sensor fusion;Safety","accident prevention;alarm systems;cameras;collision avoidance;driver information systems;road accidents;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles","safety performance;vehicle-to-vehicle accident scenarios;subject vehicle;intersection accident scenarios;accident prevention rate;major accident scenarios identification;collision warning system evaluation;advanced driver assistance system;ADAS;camera-Based collision warning system","","1","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we demonstrate how charging operations can be supported with a novel type of Green Light Optimal Dwell Time Advisory (GLODTA) system dedicated to electric buses. It not only can support on-route battery charging so that charging operations are integrated into schedule constraints but it can also replace existing holding strategies used to regulate punctuality of bus services.

In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to learn the behavior of traffic agents at an intersection by observing several episodes of real-life scenarios captured through a static camera. We develop a feed-forward artificial neural network called the influence-network, which can simultaneously reason over the influence that agents and the environment have on each other. We compare it to an extension of popularly used Dynamic Bayesian Network. Based on data captured at a busy city intersection, we show that our model can predict trajectories of different classes of traffic agents with improved accuracy, and capture higher-level agent behavior.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317731","","Predictive models;Trajectory;Object oriented modeling;Vehicle dynamics;Bayes methods;Cameras;Urban areas","feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);object tracking;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","higher-level agent behavior;feed-forward artificial neural network;single object tracking;complex urban environment;learned interactions;urban intersections;traffic agents;trajectory prediction","","1","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are still few studies on the optimization of autonomous driving control reflecting passenger characteristics and different stress factors during the ride. In this study, passenger stress characteristics were objectively analyzed using physiological indices such as heart rate and galvanic skin response, during autonomous wheelchair usages, as well as using different types of stress factors. Two different experimental results from 12 participants suggest that there are always at least two types of passengers: one who experiences stress and the other who does not, depending on the stress factors considered.

Over the last decade there have been significant increases in both the number of individuals cycling and the quality of cycle infrastructure being provided in Ireland, and specifically in the greater Dublin region. As an increasing number of individuals either start to cycle, or return to cycling after a prolonged break, it is important for researchers to gain an understanding of cyclists' ability to assess potential hazards in complex urban environments.

While the location of the pupil can provide accurate information about gaze, the vehicle environment poses challenges that prevent the use of off-the-shelf gaze detection algorithms in the car. Head pose can be used to approximate the driver's visual attention, providing a coarse estimate which can be good enough for many applications. However, the relation between head pose and gaze is not one-to-one, depending on the driver, cognitive load, and visual task. Instead of detecting a precise gaze direction, this paper proposes a novel approach which creates a probabilistic map describing visual attention. The approach relies on Gaussian process regression (GPR), which takes the position and orientation of the drivers' head to estimate the probability that the driver is looking at a given point. The approach creates confidence regions describing the most likely gaze directions.

However, due to operational challenges among others, many mobility applications still remain niche products. This paper addresses rebalancing needs that are critical for effective fleet management in order to offset the inevitable imbalance of vehicle supply and travel demand. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning approach which adopts a deep Q network and adaptively moves idle vehicles to regain balance. This innovative model-free approach takes a very different perspective from the state-of-the-art network-based methods and is able to cope with large-scale shared systems in real time with partial or full data availability. We apply this approach to an agent-based simulator and test it on a London case study. Results show that, the proposed method outperforms the local anticipatory method by reducing the fleet size by 14% while inducing little extra vehicle distance traveled. The performance is close to the optimal solution yet the computational speed is 2.5 times faster. Collectively, the paper concludes that the proposed rebalancing approach is effective under various demand scenarios and will benefit both travelers and operators if implemented in shared mobility-on-demand systems.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317908","rebalancing;mobility-on-demand;reinforcement learning;deep Q network;ride-sharing;agent-based simulation","Conferences;Learning (artificial intelligence);Real-time systems;Data models;Heuristic algorithms;Automobiles","learning (artificial intelligence);traffic engineering computing;transportation","mobility applications;vehicle supply;travel demand;reinforcement learning approach;idle vehicles;innovative model-free approach;large-scale shared systems;extra vehicle distance;rebalancing approach;travelers;shared mobility-on-demand systems;fleet management;deep Q network","","1","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their precise effects are understudied. The primary aim of this article is to present a model for lane changing that is tractable for system-level analysis and yet captures qualities of microscopic vehicle dynamics. We present a stochastic lane changing model, which permits a two-stage reduction: 1) of the (microscopic) multi-lane problem into a stochastic single-lane problem, and 2) of the stochastic single-lane model into a Markov chain macroscopic model which captures system-level lane-changing characteristics. The first reduction contributes the first model of lane changing as a single-lane process, which permits the simplification of theoretical analysis. The Markov chain macroscopic model permits the computation of statistics on the traffic parameters, such as expected velocity and headway, thus permitting the quantification of the effect of lane changes on traffic flow. We validate the proposed model on NGSIM and confirm the accuracy of the Markov chain for computing headway statistics. Finally, counter to a common view of lane changes as perturbations which contribute to shockwave formation, we observe that lane changes reduce the variance of the velocity by 10% on a 230-meter ring road benchmark, which suggests that discretionary lane changes may serve to reduce stop and go waves rather than increase them.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317733","Modeling;Lane Changing;Stochastic Processes;Markov Chain;Microscopic;Macroscopic;Traffic Dynamics;NGSIM","Computational modeling;Microscopy;Analytical models;Markov processes;Roads;Vehicle dynamics","Markov processes;road traffic;road vehicles;vehicle dynamics","discretionary lane changes;multilane reduction;stochastic single-lane model;stochastic lane changing model;stochastic single-lane problem;Markov chain macroscopic model;system-level lane-changing characteristics;single-lane process","","1","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Vehicles spend significant time searching for a parking space near their intended destination and, as a result, city traffic grows. With new technologies, it is possible for searching vehicles to share parking-related information to increase search efficiency. In this paper, we investigated whether cooperation during parking search reduces search time as well as total travel time, which includes the final stage of walking to the destination. We modeled the cooperation between vehicles using a centralized approach: vehicles repeatedly send their current location, destination, and their past and intended search routes to a central instance. This instance optimizes the search routes and sends back an individualized route suggestion to each vehicle. Using the traffic simulator SUMO, we designed an exemplary city district in which vehicles search for roadside parking spaces. We divided the active search process into two stages: before reaching the destination and after reaching the destination without having found a parking space yet. For the first stage, we developed an algorithm which incorporates a modification of Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm to reduce “double-searching” of street segments. If no parking space has been found prior to reaching the destination, an iterative decision on the next road segment based on a cost function is applied. The computational results showed benefits in search time for all investigated cases with a reduction up to 30 percent, when many vehicles search and parking spaces are limited. Search time reductions were observed both when approaching the destination and when circling after passing the destination.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317697","","Space vehicles;Routing;Space exploration;Urban areas;Roads;Search problems","optimisation;road traffic control;search problems","free parking space;intended destination;city traffic;searching vehicles;search efficiency;parking search;intended search routes;roadside parking spaces;active search process;search time reductions;cooperative parking search;total travel time reduction;information exchange;innercity regions;vehicle search;SUMO traffic simulator;Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm;cost function","","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different from the conventional space-discretization approach (the so-called power-flow equations), we introduce an alternative approach for the assessment based on a continuum representation of distribution voltage profile. The continuum representation explicitly keeps spatial (or geographical) information on a distribution grid and hence enables us to quantify the spatial impact of EV charging, for example, how far the charging operation of EV at a particular location affects the voltage profile.

This paper presents a method measuring the confidence in the information provided by the positioning system using a metric called Map Aided Horizontal Uncertainty Level (MA-HUL). It relies on a map-matching algorithm designed to keep all likely hypotheses that are coherent with the vehicle odometry. Additionally, exteroceptive information is compared to the map data to remove ambiguities (i.e. lane marking detection from a camera). Some hypotheses are then trimmed if a mismatch is detected with sufficient confidence, keeping their number to a minimum. The use of a reference frame linked to the road is also studied to represent uncertainty independently in the along-track and cross-track axes.

To support decision making in an early stage of development, we propose a mobility on-demand simulation that reflects its system behavior on an operational level. Its core forms a discrete event simulation combined with a multi-agent approach. The main entities are fully-automated electric taxis, a central dispatcher and customers. All agents live in a shared environment consisting of a street network and charging infrastructure. The dispatching center handles matchmaking between customers and vehicles with the help of a Contract Net Protocol. Taxis compete for customer transportation requests broadcasted by the dispatcher. Routing and charging decisions are made individually by each agent. A simulation study evaluates three mobility on-demand services for Munich. The basic scenario analyzes a limited service area, where a shared vehicle fleet is responsible for the entire local traffic demand.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS, GLONASS or Galileo, meet the requirements demanded from road-level navigation systems, but with lane-level assistance being the next step, more accurate localization technologies are needed. A lot of effort has been put in improving localization relative to lanes in scenarios with simple road geometry, whereas more complex scenarios such as intersections have received less attention, even though being a key factor in navigational tasks. In this paper, we focus on self-localization in the vicinity of intersections by using the trajectories of other cars as spatial cue. The geometry of the considered intersections as well as the ideal routes of cars traversing the intersection are derived from enhancements of freely available and crowdsourced map data. The trajectory of each car is compared to possible intersection routes in order to find the route which most likely corresponds to the actual trajectory. Subsequently, a geometrical transformation is computed to align the trajectory to the corresponding route and to estimate the position of the ego-vehicle with respect to the intersection. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on multiple scenes from the KITTI Benchmark Dataset [1]. We show that the presented approach is suitable for self-localization in intersection scenarios.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317772","","Roads;Global navigation satellite system;Trajectory;Geometry;Automobiles;Global Positioning System;Task analysis","automobiles;distance measurement;driver information systems;geometry;Global Positioning System;object detection;road vehicles;satellite navigation","navigational tasks;car;crowdsourced map data;intersection scenarios;relative self-localization;map-relative localization;driver assistance tasks;Global Navigation Satellite Systems;road-level navigation systems;lane-level assistance;road geometry;intersection routes","","1","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed autonomous braking system automatically decides whether to apply the brake at each time step when confronting the risk of collision using the information on the obstacle obtained by the sensors. The problem of designing brake control is formulated as searching for the optimal policy in Markov decision process (MDP) model where the state is given by the relative position of the obstacle and the vehicle's speed, and the action space is defined as the set of the brake actions including 1) no braking, 2) weak, 3) mid, 4) strong brakiong actions. The policy used for brake control is learned through computer simulations using the deep reinforcement learning method called deep Q-network (DQN). In order to derive desirable braking policy, we propose the reward function which balances the damage imposed to the obstacle in case of accident and the reward achieved when the vehicle runs out of risk as soon as possible.

One of the biggest challenges in the smart mobility domain is the use of data science as an enabler for the implementation of large scale transportation sharing solutions. In particular, the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) requires the combination of artificial intelligence and discrete simulations when exploring the effects of what-if decisions in complex scenarios with millions of users. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting an innovative data modelling framework that can be used for ITS related problems. We demonstrate that the use of graphs and time series in multi-dimensional data models can satisfy the requirements of descriptive and predictive analytics in real-world case studies with massive amounts of continuously changing data. The features of the framework are explained in a case study of a complex collaborative mobility system that combines carpooling, carsharing and shared parking. The performance of the framework is tested with a large-scale dataset, performing machine learning tasks and interactive realtime data visualization.

This type of ADS is typically limited to restricted-access freeways only, that is, the transition from manual to automated modes takes place only after the ramp merging process is completed manually. One major challenge to extend the automation to ramp merging is that the automated vehicle needs to incorporate and optimize long-term objectives (e.g. successful and smooth merge) when near-term actions must be safely executed. Moreover, the merging process involves interactions with other vehicles whose behaviors are sometimes hard to predict but may influence the merging vehicle's optimal actions. To tackle such a complicated control problem, we propose to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for finding an optimal driving policy by maximizing the long-term reward in an interactive environment. Specifically, we apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to model the interactive environment, from which an internal state containing historical driving information is conveyed to a Deep Q-Network (DQN). The DQN is used to approximate the Q-function, which takes the internal state as input and generates Q-values as output for action selection. With this DRL architecture, the historical impact of interactive environment on the long-term reward can be captured and taken into account for deciding the optimal control policy. The proposed architecture has the potential to be extended and applied to other autonomous driving scenarios such as driving through a complex intersection or changing lanes under varying traffic flow conditions.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317735","Autonomous Driving;Highway On-Ramp Merge;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Long Short-Term Memory;Deep Q-Network;Control Policy","Merging;Computer architecture;Machine learning;Acceleration;Learning (artificial intelligence);Conferences;Intelligent transportation systems","driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimal control;road traffic control;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","deep reinforcement learning architecture;driving systems;ADS;freeway-pilot functions;restricted-access freeways;automated modes;ramp merging process;automation;automated vehicle;long-term objectives;near-term actions;vehicles whose behaviors;merging vehicle;complicated control problem;optimal driving policy;long-term reward;interactive environment;Long Short-Term Memory architecture;internal state;historical driving information;Deep Q-Network;DQN;action selection;DRL architecture;optimal control policy;autonomous driving scenarios;Q-function approximation;on-ramp merge;DRL techniques;automated driving systems","","2","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We firstly cluster lines according to their delay patterns in order to extract lines of most need for timetable revisions. We then develop a simple approach to modify the timetable. The main effect of the different timetable options can be illustrated graphically by showing the aforementioned trade-off as Pareto optimal front of timetable options.

However, we propose an approach in which we normalise the training data and use the predicted probabilities of the resulting tree, confronted with a threshold value, to determine multiple target labels. This enables us to predict sets of junction design alternatives with traditional algorithms and thus having the advantage of using profoundly proven and widely available methods with a range of modelling options. We evaluate our approach based on its performance concerning tree complexity and predictive accuracy, for which we introduce new set comparison measures.

We conducted two studies evaluating the effects of this system on driver performance and user experience. The first is a quantitative controlled study examining driving performance after an abrupt loss of autonomous vehicle control. The participants (N = 56) experienced a simulated driving scenario that varied the behavior of the steering wheel (transforming and non-transforming) and the transition time (2 seconds and 5 seconds). Drivers who experienced the transforming steering wheel performed significantly better than those who experienced a non-transforming steering wheel. The second study is qualitative and exploratory, where interaction experts (N = 14) evaluated the transforming steering wheel using design improvisation.

To enable these intelligence vehicles to acquire driving skills at a level comparable to that of human drivers, long short-term memory of previous self-driving processes is necessary, but is difficult to introduce into the above-mentioned frameworks. In this paper, we propose a model for self-driving cars called the cognitive map-based neural network (CMNN). Our framework consists of three parts: a convolutional neural network that can perceive the environment in the manner that the human visual cortex does, a cognitive map to describe the locations of objects in a complex traffic scene and the relationships among them, and a recurrent neural network to process long short-term memory from the cognitive map, which is updated in real time. The proposed model is built to simultaneously handle three tasks: i) detecting free space and lane boundaries, ii) estimating vehicle pose and obstacle distance, and iii) learning to plan and control based on the behaviors of a human driver. More significantly, our approach introduces external instructions during an end-to-end driving process. To test it, we created a large-scale road vehicle dataset (RVD) containing more than 50,000 labeled road images captured by three cameras.

VT number is obtained using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained by the data from multiple simulation experiments. The results show that: 1) the Colored PCD can reveal more useful signal coordination information; 2) VT number can indicate the potential of improvement for the subject coordination system; and 3) the proposed VT number prediction approach can give a robust VT number.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317810","Colored PCD;VT number;Signal Coordination;Potential of Improvement;SVM;Simulation Experiments","Detectors;Data models;Mathematical model;Measurement;System performance;Support vector machines;Conferences","data visualisation;image colour analysis;road traffic;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing","speed patterns;subject coordination system;regional travel times;coordination signal system;visualization tool;Purdue Coordination Diagram;visual assessment;HSV color model;vehicle arrival visualization;arterial signal coordination system performance;VT number prediction;signal coordination information;Support Vector Machine;Colored PCD concept;traffic signals","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) are communication systems, which allow humans to mentally interact with external devices and machines. They detect, record and analyze electroencephalography (EEG) waves, which reflect certain brain functions or commands. In this paper, EEG data readings are collected and classified, using a cost-efficient BCI headset and Neural Network (NN) classifier. The objective is to classify and identify the users route decisions, while being on-board of an automated vehicle. The system takes advantage of the capacity of the automated vehicle for autonomous maneuvering, and the brainwave sensor allows the user to take route decision.

The main contribution of this work is to construct a method to classify drivers as the fundamental model to consider characteristics of each driver under a scene that the target vehicle follows the preceding vehicle. Many methods have been proposed using data-driven approaches, however, each driver has an own driving style and shows different characteristics to be influenced by traffic conditions. As the result, the performance of previous methods to detect common patterns trained by machine learning techniques may realize the limitation. The proposed method extracts a new feature to describe a driving style by using a dynamic potential field method, and it can be a significant feature to classify drivers.

Future Intelligent Vehicles (IVs) are expected to have higher perception ranges, faster reactions and coordinated mobility capability. At early market penetration, IVs will share road with MDVs and will adjust its driving dynamics according to the dynamics of other neighboring vehicles. In such a scenario, we investigate how IVs can compensate for human factors impacting MDVs and accordingly improve traffic safety in mixed traffic conditions. We model a centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) based controller and integrate constraints derived from human factors. We show that IVs may not only reduce collisions, but also increase traffic density without negatively impacting traffic safety. We finally assess the impact of a gradual penetration of IVs in a mixed vehicle scenario.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317953","","Human factors;Mathematical model;Conferences;Safety;Acceleration;Intelligent vehicles","accident prevention;collision avoidance;control engineering computing;driver information systems;human factors;predictive control;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","manually driven vehicles;human factors;human errors;human weaknesses;MDVs;Future Intelligent Vehicles;IVs;neighboring vehicles;mixed vehicle scenario;collision mitigation strategy;centralized Model Predictive Control based controller;MPC;traffic safety","","2","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper focuses on a special speed trajectory optimization problem for urban railway transportation, in which the train is required to alter its speed from one to another either by traction or regenerative braking within the time and distance constraints. Previous papers in this area propose a comprehensive Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to solve this problem considering route gradients and speed limits etc. Further to the previous work, this paper tries to contribute in two aspects. First, this paper explicitly proves the rationality of the assumption of monotonicity of the speeds during the speed-changing process using Pontriyagin's Maximum Principle with some basic assumptions for engineering applications. Second, this paper proposes an improved optimization model which takes into account the motor efficiency during traction and braking. Optimization results verify and demonstrate the significant impact of the motor efficiency on energy saving.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317702","","Trajectory optimization;Rail transportation;Traction motors;Conferences","integer programming;linear programming;railways;regenerative braking;traction;transportation","speed-changing process;mixed integer linear programming model;regenerative braking;urban railway transportation;railway traction energy;motor efficiency;urban rail vehicles;partial speed trajectory optimization","","1","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The assessment of collision risk against moving vehicles in the occluded area is difficult because vehicle motion information for perception is not available. In order to overcome this difficulty, this paper presents a probabilistic approach of collision risk assessment for the potential collision of vehicles in the occluded area. The probabilistic assessment consists of three steps: a field of view (FoV) modeling of perception, a motion prediction of potential collision, and a probabilistic collision risk assessment. The first step is a FoV modeling of perception to classify the occluded region of perception visibility. The second step is motion predictions of the potential collision vehicles by applying the modeled FoV to the roadway geometry in the precise map. The final step is a probabilistic assessment of the collision risk for the occluded vehicles based on the motion predictions and probabilistic modeling of vehicle speed on the road. The proposed collision risk assessment was evaluated using various occlusion scenarios in real traffic situations, such as an alleyway.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317666","Collision risk assessment;Occluded vehicle;Roadway geometry model;Probabilistic speed modeling","Roads;Geometry;Sensors;Risk management;Probabilistic logic;Predictive models;Vehicles","collision avoidance;optical radar;probability;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;stereo image processing;traffic engineering computing","occluded area;precise map;vehicle motion information;probabilistic assessment;motion prediction;probabilistic collision risk assessment;perception visibility;potential collision vehicles;occluded vehicles;vehicle speed;collision vehicle;traffic situations;field of view modeling;FoV modeling","","2","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the same purpose, CBTC systems are to be deployed on suburban railway lines where operating principles and constraints are significantly different. In this paper, we present the research methodology we apply to develop regulation strategies adapted to CBTC railway lines. A regulation method for CBTC trains on a suburban line is introduced. This method is designed to combine CBTC functionalities with suburban operating principles. It includes a traffic management method in station, and a rescheduling method in case of disturbances. The proposed regulation method is integrated into the railway system simulation tool SIMONE developed by SNCF. This simulation tool includes models of the whole CBTC system, as well as the classic signaling system, train dynamics and railway infrastructures. Models of these different agents are briefly described. The integration of the proposed regulation method into the tool SIMONE allows evaluating performances while taking into account the functional complexity of a CBTC railway system. The approach is illustrated with a realistic case: simulations of a CBTC traffic on the urban part of a railway line in the Paris region network are described. The proposed regulation method shows interesting results in disturbed situations according to the railway operating principles.","2153-0017","978-1-5386-1526-3978-1-5386-1525-6978-1-5386-1527","10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8317670","CBTC;railway;traffic management;suburban;rescheduling;optimization","Rail transportation;Tools;Communication system signaling;Computational modeling;Public transportation;Integrated circuit modeling;Real-time systems","optimisation;rail traffic control;railway engineering;vehicle dynamics","automatic train supervision;CBTC suburban railway line;CBTC system;suburban railway lines;regulation strategies;CBTC railway lines;regulation method;CBTC trains;suburban line;CBTC functionalities;suburban operating principles;traffic management method;rescheduling method;railway system simulation tool SIMONE;classic signaling system;train dynamics;railway infrastructures;CBTC railway system;CBTC traffic;railway operating principles;communication-based train control systems","","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
