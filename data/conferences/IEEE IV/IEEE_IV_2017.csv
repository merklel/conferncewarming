As a novel breakthrough, PArallel VEhicles (PAVE) incorporate the ACP theory, which facilitates real-time interaction and optimization of the actual self-driving vehicles and the artificial ones. As a result, PAVE can maintain intelligent control of the actual self-driving vehicles and achieve the global optimization via software-defined self-driving vehicles, intelligent infrastructure construction, and parallel control center.

Among them, we publish 10000 kilometers driving data for end-to-end autonomous driving research. The BDD consists of two parts: forward images and vehicle motion attitude. The vehicle motion attitude is derived from real time kinematic GPS location data with standard deviation of 3 centimeters. Our reactive control model consists of lateral control and longitudinal control. We employ curvature instead of steering angle for lateral control, and leverage acceleration, not throttle or brake, for longitudinal control. CNN network is employed for lateral control model, mapping a single image from forward camera directly to corresponding curvature. For longitudinal control, stacked convolutional LSTM is used to extract spatial and temporal features from a sequence of frames, and to map the features with longitudinal control commands.

The NLP stage is based on a Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework, which contains sentence-level sentiment analysis and word/phrase-level context extraction. Experiments are conducted using the CU-Move in-vehicle speech corpus. Results indicate that the DNN architecture is effective for navigation dialog language understanding, whereas the NLP performances are affected by ASR errors.

To address this problem, we present a model predictive-based approach for longitudinal control in autonomous driving by taking the lateral interruptions into account. First, a virtual lead vehicle scheme is introduced to predict the future behavior of the actual lead vehicle. By following the virtual lead vehicle rather than the actual lead vehicle, the control of the host vehicle is simplified to keep a proper following gap problem. Then, a strategic car-following gap (CFG) model, generated from highway naturalistic driving data, is employed to describe the safety hazard and the probability of cut-ins by other vehicles. A model predictive controller, incorporating the strategic CFG model as well as the acceleration and jerk limitations in the objective function, is designed for the longitudinal control of the host vehicle. Solving the optimal control problem can not only smooth the oscillation and overshoots caused by the lateral interruptions but also reduce the probability of cut-ins from the adjacent lanes. The proposed approach is simulated and validated through some predefined test scenarios in CarSim software.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995745","Model predictive control;Autonomous driving;Virtual lead vehicle;Strategic car-following gap model","Lead;Acceleration;Safety;Predictive models;Kalman filters;Control systems;Mathematical model","optimal control;predictive control;road safety;road vehicles","model predictive-based approach;longitudinal control;autonomous driving;lateral interruptions;driving safety;virtual lead vehicle scheme;strategic car-following gap;strategic CFG model;highway naturalistic driving data;optimal control problem;CarSim software","","2","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the queue length estimation at isolated intersections is explored to be transformed into the problem of deriving the number of queued vehicles. Two models, the improved and advanced interpolation methods, are then introduced to the condition of single cycle and multiple cycles, respectively. The microscopic simulation software VISSIM is adopted to evaluate the effect of the derived models. Its analysis shows that, under the condition of single cycle, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the improved interpolation method is less than 2 vehicles when the equipped rate of i-VICS OBU is higher than 50% and the maximum MAE with 30% equipped rate will be no more than 4 vehicles. On the other hand, under the condition of multiple cycles, the MAE of the advanced interpolation method with very low OBU-equipped rates will be less than 6 vehicles.

Thereby, vehicle sensor data can be leveraged for the design and implementation of entirely new services even beyond traffic-related applications (such as hyper-local traffic forecasts). This paper presents the architecture for a Vehicle Big Data Marketplace as enabler of cross-sectorial and innovative vehicle data services. Therefore, the novel Common Vehicle Information Model (CVIM) is defined as an open and harmonized data model, allowing the aggregation of brand-independent and generic data sets. Within this work the realization of a prototype CVIM and Marketplace implementation is presented.

The required highly accurate dead-reckoning localization can be achieved by a well-calibrated kinematic odometry model. For this purpose, the presented Extended Kalman filter approach combines a Differential-Velocity system model and a GNSS measurement model. Subsequently the intelligent self-adaptive modifications are introduced to allow the SA-RAKPE to work even under difficult conditions The self-adaptive modifications include a GNSS-Delay-Finder Module that calculates variable delays of the signals used in complex vehicle architectures. The newly developed SA-RAPKE deals with changes in the system and measurement mode accuracies and even works during interruptions caused by GNSS-shortages. To do this, it changes the update equation and fills the interruptions with virtual parameter measurement to avoid estimation inaccuracies from observability loss and even to store the level of learned parameters. After passing the GNSS-shortages, the filter compensates the error in the system model depending on the length of the GNSS-shortage This makes it possible to continue the parameter learning while passing a great number of bad condition passages. This newly developed self-adaptive filter learns the true axle parameter faster than a restartable filter. The results show that despite numerous high-rise zones, tunnels and bridges, outstanding performance and a short learning phase ensue, especially in urban areas.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995760","","Mathematical model;Axles;Kalman filters;Delays;Covariance matrices;Kinematics;Wheels","adaptive filters;axles;estimation theory;intelligent transportation systems;Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;parameter estimation;road vehicles;satellite navigation","Global Navigatior Satellite System;GNSS-shortages;self-adaptive rear axle kinematic parameter estimator;SA-RAKPE;intelligent self-adaptive modification;automatic-driving-system;passenger vehicle;kinematic odometry model;extended Kalman filter;differential-velocity system model;virtual parameter measurement;parameter learning;self-adaptive filter;intelligent transportation systems;ITS","","1","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of a safety indicator is to determine the correct moment for initiating a Collision Avoidance brake action to prevent a collision with the preceding truck in threatening situations. Three safety indicators are selected for an evaluation: the intended acceleration of the preceding truck, which is shared via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, the Brake Threat Number (BTN - based on simple vehicle models and an emergency brake assumption of the lead), and the Time-To-Collision (TTC - based on a constant velocity assumption). The latter two do not rely on V2V communication, but are obtained via on-board signals. Requirements for the amount of false negatives (missing a threatening situation) and the false positives (identifying a safe situation as threatening) are derived from a functional safety perspective. To find thresholds for the safety indicators that minimize the false negative rate, emergency brake tests are used. To evaluate the number of false positives, a set of data of two trucks driving in a platoon at 0.5 s at mixed-traffic highways in Belgium and the Netherlands, collected during 8 hours of automated driving in a platoon, is used. The results indicate that the communicated intended acceleration of the preceding truck might be able to distinguish safe and threatening situations in a vehicle platoon. Furthermore, for situations without V2V, both the BTN and the TTC are not capable to distinguish between threatening and safe situations. The amount of false positives found in the safe driving data-set does not fulfill the requirements derived from functional safety perspective.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995847","","Safety;Collision avoidance;Brakes;Vehicles;Acceleration;Hardware;Roads","braking;collision avoidance;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;vehicular ad hoc networks","safety indicators;truck platooning;intervehicle distances;collision avoidance brake action;threatening situations;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;V2V;brake threat number;BTN;time-to-collision;TTC;constant velocity assumption;functional safety perspective;emergency brake tests;mixed-traffic highways;Belgium;Netherlands","","3","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead of using explicit rules, we propose a unified path planning approach using Model Predictive Control (MPC), which automatically decides the mode of maneuvers. To ensure safety, we model surrounding vehicles as polygons and develop a type of constraints in MPC to enforce the collision avoidance between the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles.

Here the challenge is to optimize the driving comfort and travel-duration, while always keeping within the safety limits. Human drivers analyze and try to anticipate the traffic situation choosing their actions not only based on current information but also based on experience. The decision making process can be treated as a planning problem. Classical planning systems consider the autonomous driving task as a global numeric optimization problem, which in populated dynamic environments can become computationally intractable. In addition, purely numeric computations hamper the understanding of the decision making for the human user. We propose a planning system that presents a multi-level architecture, similar to the human reasoning process, which combines continuous planning with semantic information. This allows the planning system to deal with the complexity of the problem in a computationally efficient way and also provides an intuitive interface to communicate the decisions to the driver.

The predictor generalizes historical speed data's underlying pattern and predicts from probability aspect. One novelty of the method is the usage of fuzzy modeling to eliminate the resolution limitation in vehicle acceleration state definition, classification, and prediction. The method uses Auto-regressive (AR) model to capture vehicle speed data's short term dynamics, and classifies the data into multiple acceleration states by fuzzy membership. In the prediction process, acceleration measurements are mapped to the Markov states by fuzzy encoding, and future acceleration states are predicted by Markov transition. Deterministic speed prediction is calculated from the trained AR models, which are selected by fuzzy state membership similarity. The developed predictor is tested with a vehicle's real urban driving data, and the effectiveness of the incorporated techniques is verified by a comparison study.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995827","","Acceleration;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Hidden Markov models;Vehicle dynamics;Markov processes;Vehicles","acceleration measurement;autoregressive processes;fuel economy;fuzzy set theory;Markov processes;road vehicles;velocity measurement","vehicle speed prediction;fuzzy Markov model;autoregressive model;vehicle control designs;fuel economy;computationally light vehicle short term speed predictor;speed measurement;fuzzy modeling;vehicle speed data short term dynamics;acceleration measurements;fuzzy encoding;Markov transition;deterministic speed prediction;fuzzy state membership similarity;urban driving data","","2","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we examine a number of CAV applications whose system effectiveness focus is targeted on the three key areas of safety, mobility and environment, and then examine whether some PIs are synergistic or antagonistic. Using the Lane Speed Monitoring application as a specific example, we explore the in-depth relationship between different types of measures of effectiveness (MOEs) under different penetration rates of the technology, in order to show the association between the application focus and tradeoffs to be made among different performance measures. As part of the analysis, several future research directions are discussed, including the identification of key influential factors on system performance to obtain co-benefits in terms of different types of MOEs.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995838","","Safety;Fuels;Vehicles;Adaptive systems;Cruise control;Brakes","intelligent transportation systems;performance index;road safety;road vehicles","co-benefit and tradeoff evaluation framework;connected vehicle applications;automated vehicle applications;CAV applications;transportation systems;safety;performance indices;lane speed monitoring application;measures of effectiveness","","","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A platoon-based intersection management system for autonomous vehicles","M. Bashiri; C. H.

Autonomous intersection management is among the more challenging traffic scenarios, which involves coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through a conflict zone. Intersection management is also potentially one of the more beneficial traffic scenarios in terms of mobility and environmental impact. In this paper we propose a platoon-based approach for the cooperative intersection management problem. We assert that leveraging the platooning capability of autonomous vehicles could improve the efficiency of any policy at an intersection, in terms of average delay time per vehicle and can reduce the communication overhead in the vicinity of intersections by a factor of up to the average platoon size. We also develop a new autonomous intersection management method that guarantees the safety of traffic by allowing one platoon in the conflict zone at any time. We examine the effects of platooning on a simple stop sign at a single 4-way intersection in a simulated environment and report the results in terms of average delay per vehicle and communication overhead. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method in a simulated environment and compare the results in terms of average wait time per vehicle and variance in delay with that of a stop sign.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995794","","Delays;Safety;Autonomous vehicles;Scheduling;Schedules;Roads;Accidents","environmental factors;intelligent transportation systems;road safety;road traffic","platoon-based intersection management system;autonomous vehicles;intelligent transportation systems;autonomous intersection management;traffic scenarios;mobility;environmental impact;traffic safety","","4","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The analysis is based on fleet test data, which was collected by 16 different commercial companies and 32 individual vehicles in the area of Munich. The approach in this paper is to use a simulation model, in which a backward-facing longitudinal dynamic model can simulate different types of electric vehicles. In addition, a charging simulation is integrated which includes the charging behavior of the user and different types of charging stations in the fleet test area of Munich. With the electric vehicle and charging simulation, it is possible to evaluate the current and future charging infrastructure of Munich.

This paper tackles the scenario of a left turn maneuver in an urban environment with the presence of blind corners.

In these cases, our approach allows to safely merge into traffic by using an environment representation based on tracked objects as well as an object-free sensor fusion including the calculation of unobservable regions in a digital map.

The advantage of the new proposed method, as opposed to those that resort to the global optimization methods, is the low computing time that lines up with the standardA-Star (A*) method. The strategy consists of looking for a practical path in the potential field-according to the potential gradient descent algorithm (PGDA) - and adding a repulsive potential to the current state, in case of blocking configuration, a local minimum. When the PGDA reaches the global minimum, a new potential field will be constructed with only one minimum that matches the final destination of the robot, the global minimum.

Thus, the development of high accuracy vehicle recognition algorithms is essential for safe and efficient automated driving. However, detecting vehicles with consistently high accuracy is difficult because there are various vehicle types with different appearances, such as sedans, buses, trucks, and SUVs. This intra-class variation must be addressed or, irregular recognition performance can occur, depending on vehicle type. Conventional machine learning-based algorithms are inadequate to address this problem because they are mostly trained on samples of entire appearance. Considering the wide variability in vehicle appearance, collecting samples of every vehicle type may not be ideal. In this study, we propose a vehicle recognition algorithm using common appearance characteristics of every vehicle type. Rectangular shapes are captured by a 3D LIDAR while tires and bumpers are captured by a monocular camera. Angular features extracted from these common appearances are then fused by the Dempster-Shafer theory framework for vehicle recognition. By performing real-world experiments, we demonstrated that common appearances captured by the proposed algorithm provide sufficiently generalized features to recognize diverse vehicle types in urban driving environments.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995751","","Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Laser radar;Cameras;Tires;Machine learning algorithms","cameras;feature extraction;image capture;inference mechanisms;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;optical radar","common appearance capture;3D LIDAR;monocular camera;high-accuracy vehicle recognition algorithms;vehicle detection;ego-vehicle;safe-and-efficient automated driving;irregular recognition performance;conventional machine learning-based algorithms;common appearance characteristics;angular feature extraction;Dempster-Shafer theory framework;urban driving environments","","","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet until high driving automation and full driving automation is achieved, a human driver is expected to respond appropriately to any malfunction or adverse on-road conditions preventing the ADS from reliably sustaining the dynamic driving task performance. However, automation causes drowsiness and hypo-vigilance, which can compromise a human driver's ability to respond to ADS-issued requests. Hence the necessity of defining dynamic driving task fallback strategies that can be performed by the ADS, if and when necessary. The proposed fallback strategy is aimed at level 4 ADS features designed to operate a vehicle on a road whose characteristics make any attempt at stopping hazardous. It naturally applies to level 5 ADS-operated vehicles and to ADS-dedicated vehicles as well. The transition stage, during which the strategy is triggered, consists in the replacement of missing vehicles and obstacles in the world model with ghost objects. An embedded visibility map is then used to retrieve the maximum distance at which the ADS-operated vehicle can be seen, when driving behind it. The speed profile underlying the fallback strategy meets a time to collision criterion of 4 s, which enables the avoidance and the mitigation of rear-end collisions. The behaviour of drivers in collision imminent situations cannot be observed in test track studies due to safety concerns. As a result, experiments were conducted in the driving simulation software SCANeR studio.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995973","","Roads;Vehicles;Automation;Vehicle dynamics;Monitoring;Meteorology;Software","hazards;intelligent transportation systems;road vehicles;simulation","dynamic driving task fallback;automated driving system;driving environment;ADS;hazardous weather conditions;road vehicle;driving simulation software;SCANeR studio","","2","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One recently proposed method used deep neural networks(DNN) to learn the relationship between the actual parking trajectories and the corresponding steering actions, so as to find the best parking trajectory via direct recalling. However, this method can only handle a special vehicle whose dynamic parameters are well known. In this paper, we use transfer learning technique to further extend this direct trajectory planning method and master general parking skills. We aim to mimic how human drivers make parking by using a specially designed deep neural network. The first few layers of this DNN contain the general parking trajectory planning knowledge for all kinds of vehicles; while the last few layers of this DNN can be quickly tuned to adapt various kinds of vehicles.

To do this, not only the error to the path is minimized, but also the error to the desired orientation and the control signals requests. The controller uses an extended kinematic model that takes into consideration the vehicle crabbing capability and is able to track not only kinematically feasible paths, but also plan and track over non-feasible discontinuous paths. Ackermann steering geometry is used to transform the control requests, curvature, and crabbing angle, to wheel angles.

The method uses lane-level accurate maps with dedicated attributes, such as connectedness and adjacency, and an automotive Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver assisted with dead-reckoning (DR) sensors.

In particular, since it is unknown during planning whether a certain decision, such as passing another traffic participant on the left or right, will result in a safe and comfortable motion. Exhaustive exploration of all principle driving paths is computationally expensive, so that one typically reverts to heuristics - this, however can be unsatisfactory in situations when the heuristics fail to find a solution although it exists. We address this problem by computing the union of all possible motions for a sequence of high-level decisions (e.g. overtake vehicle on the left and then another one on the right), which we refer to as a driving corridor. Our proposed algorithm is over-approximative, i.e. the union of driving corridors provably encloses all possible motions. Thus, if the set of reachable positions within a driving corridor becomes empty, the corresponding sequence of high-level decisions is infeasible and can be discarded by the motion planner. Driving corridors also facilitate selecting high-level plans: Large driving corridors should be preferred since they provide more opportunities for optimizing motions and are more robust towards unpredicted changes. Numerical examples demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995714","","Trajectory;Planning;Computational modeling;Optimization;Space vehicles;Vehicle dynamics;Space exploration","mobile robots;path planning;road vehicles","possible driving corridors;automated vehicles;motion planing;dynamic traffic scenes;comfortable motion;driving paths;high-level decisions;high-level plans","","3","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our proposal, stereo camera is applied to generate visual odometry and reconstruct the building scene. The accumulated building scenes form local building map. We integrate the local building map and Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) map generated from 3D building map in particle filter. Lane detection result helps to rectify the inner lane positioning error and keep lane with the aid of 2D road map.

It is mainly used to increase the individual's benefit such as decreasing travel time. However, the selfish decision on the lane-changing behavior can sometimes make a negative impact on the overall traffic flow. As autonomous vehicle technology develops, modeling lane changing action as well as lane changing decision making falls within the control category of autonomous vehicles. In this study, we focused on decision making of lane change for autonomous vehicles considering traffic flow, and accordingly, we propose a lane change control system considering whole traffic flow. The lane change control system predicts the future traffic situation using Cell Transmission Model and determines the lane change probability for each lane that minimizes the total time delay through the genetic algorithm. The lane change control system then provides the lane change probability to the vehicles. Performance evaluation of the proposed system in macroscopic simulation shows reduction in the overall travel time delay. The performance of proposed system is also evaluated in microscopic traffic simulation, evaluating the potential performance when it is applied to the actual traffic system: The maximum traffic flow was increased, and the congestion area was greatly reduced and the time required for individual vehicles was reduced.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995799","","Control systems;Autonomous vehicles;Predictive models;Genetic algorithms;Computational modeling;Delay effects","decision making;genetic algorithms;minimisation;mobile robots;position control;probability;road traffic control;road vehicles","simulation-based lane change control system;autonomous vehicles;lane-changing behavior;lane changing decision making;traffic flow;cell transmission model;lane change probability;time delay minimization;genetic algorithm","","2","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Range Extended (R-EX) hybrid technology represents a valuable option to address these issues, since it offers the benefits of an EV, such as the electric driving for medium distances, while still maintaining the internal combustion engine, which can be operated at its optimal efficiency to recharge the battery, thus eliminating the driver's range anxiety.

Modern electric vehicles usually still have difficulties in reaching similar travel distances as combustion engine powered vehicles. While increasing the range of electric vehicles continues to be an active field of research, it is already possible to increase the energy efficiency by applying a more energy efficient driving behavior. A forward-backward Dynamic Programming model predictive optimization approach is used to generate an energy efficient velocity and gear change trajectory. Due to the finite length of the computation horizon, common Dynamic Programming approaches sometimes have problems of choosing the optimal state at the end of the horizon. To address this problem, a method is presented that makes use of historic accumulated minimum costs to create a separate time-invariant auxiliary horizon that grows during the journey. The auxiliary horizon is used to yield a better long range estimation of the optimal terminal behavior of the optimal trajectory within the regular horizon. While the proposed method can be applied to different types of optimization problems, the focus is on the predictive energy efficiency optimization of electric vehicles.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995883","Dynamic Programming;long distance horizon estimation;reuse historic costs;monetary costs;energy efficiency driving;model predictive optimization;REM 2030 electric vehicle","Optimization;Electric vehicles;Trajectory;Dynamic programming;Gears;Energy consumption;Engines","dynamic programming;electric vehicles;energy conservation;engines;optimisation","predictive energy efficiency optimization;long distance horizon estimation;environment protection;electric vehicles;travel distances;combustion engine powered vehicles;energy efficient driving behavior;forward-backward dynamic programming model predictive optimization approach;energy efficient velocity;gear change trajectory;computation horizon;historic accumulated minimum costs;separate time-invariant auxiliary horizon;optimal terminal behavior;optimal trajectory","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a point feature map is created using images from a previous pass of the area to map. Thereafter, the map is used for high-precision localization in real-time. While localization, a rough prior estimate of the current pose is used to shrink the search space for feature matching by projecting mapped landmarks into current images.

The solution of the POMDP is a policy determining the optimal acceleration of the ego vehicle along a preplanned path. Therefore, the policy is optimized for the most likely future scenarios resulting from an interactive, probabilistic motion model for the other vehicles. Considering possible future measurements of the surroundings allows the autonomous car to incorporate the estimated change in future prediction accuracy in the optimal policy.

In particular, real-world driving data collected on public roads with only standard production sensors is utilized to synthesize a hidden Markov model with the aid of unscented Kalman filtering and the expectation maximization technique. Exact probabilistic inference is used to obtain a posterior probability distribution over the driver's intention.

However, the occurrence of unexpected events may require vehicles to perform aggressive maneuvers, near the limits of their dynamic capacities. In order to ensure the occupant's safety in these situations, the ability to plan controllable but near-limits trajectories will be of very high importance. One of the main issues in planning aggressive maneuvers lies in the high complexity of the vehicle dynamics near the handling limits, which effectively makes state-of-the-art methods such as Model Predictive Control difficult to use. This article studies a highly precise model of the vehicle body to derive a simpler, constrained second-order integrator dynamic model which remains precise even near the handling limits of the vehicle.

Maintaining the system's states in a control invariant set of the system guarantees the persistent feasibility of the corresponding MPC scheme. Therefore, the persistent feasibility concern can be expressed as the problem of computing an effective control invariant set of the system and maintaining the system states inside it. In this paper, two approaches are presented to compute control invariant sets for the motion planning problem, the linearization-convexification approach and the brute-force search approach. The control invariant sets calculated via these two approaches are numerically analyzed and compared.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995821","","Planning;Safety;Silicon;Autonomous vehicles;Real-time systems;Heuristic algorithms;Predictive models","collision avoidance;convex programming;linearisation techniques;mobile robots;predictive control;road vehicles;search problems;set theory","persistent feasibility;model predictive motion planning;MPC;decision making;autonomous vehicle motion planning;obstacle detection;control invariant set;linearization-convexification approach;brute-force search approach","","2","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quality of the prediction directly affects the frequency of trajectory planning. With a poor estimation of the future development, more computational effort has to be put in re-planning, and a safe vehicle state at the end of the planning horizon is not guaranteed. A holistic probabilistic prediction, considering inputs, results and parameters as random variables, highly reduces the problem. A time frame of several seconds requires a probabilistic description of the scene evolution, where uncertainty or accuracy is represented by the trajectory distribution. Following this strategy, a novel evaluation method is needed, coping with the fact, that the future evolution of a scene is also uncertain. We present a method to evaluate the probabilistic prediction of real traffic scenes with varying start conditions. The proposed prediction is based on a particle filter, estimating behavior describing parameters of a microscopic traffic model.

We collect a large set of data using The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) and classify the image features into three categories (sky-related, roadside-related, and road-related features). We then design two experimental frameworks to investigate the importance of each single feature for training a CNN controller. The first framework uses the training data with all three features included to train a controller, which is then tested with data that has one feature removed to evaluate the feature's effects. The second framework is trained with the data that has one feature excluded, while all three features are included in the test data. Different driving scenarios are selected to test and analyze the trained controllers using the two experimental frameworks. The experiment results show that (1) the road-related features are indispensable for training the controller, (2) the roadside-related features are useful to improve the generalizability of the controller to scenarios with complicated roadside information, and (3) the sky-related features have limited contribution to train an end-to-end autonomous vehicle controller.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995850","","Training;Autonomous vehicles;Roads;Neural networks;Automobiles;Training data","cellular neural nets;convolution;feature selection;image classification;mobile robots;neurocontrollers;road traffic control;traffic engineering computing","feature analysis;feature selection;end-to-end autonomous vehicle controller;deep learning;autonomous vehicles;nonlinear functions;convolutional neural networks;CNNs;computation cost reduction;the open racing car simulator;TORCS;image feature classification;CNN controller training","","5","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To predict future behavior and potential risks associated with surrounding vehicles, their lateral position information is required. However, existing computer vision algorithms tend to either focus on longitudinal measurements or provide lateral position information with limited performance for limited scenes (i.e no viewpoint change and occlusion). In this paper, feature-based lateral position estimation algorithm is proposed using stereo vision and provides lateral position regardless of viewpoint change and occlusion by extracting a pixel-wise feature. In the preprocessing step, v-disparity from stereo depth map is calculated and used for ground detection. Then, vehicle candidates are created based on image thresholding and filtering, removing the ground portion from the camera image. These generated candidates are verified as vehicles by using deep convolutional neural network. In order to track and estimate the lateral position of the detected vehicles, speeded up robust feature (SURF) points are matched in consecutive image frames, and the feature point is projected onto the ground; defined as the grounded feature point. Finally, inverse perspective mapping (IPM) is applied on the original image to estimate the lateral position of the grounded feature point. The proposed algorithm successfully detects a feature point of neighboring vehicle and estimates its lateral position by tracking the grounded feature point. For testing the algorithm, the datasets in a highway and an urban setting are used and provide zero mean error and 0.25m standard deviation error in lateral position estimation.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995811","","Feature extraction;Estimation;Robustness;Advanced driver assistance systems;Cameras;Support vector machines;Stereo vision","computer vision;convolution;driver information systems;feature extraction;image filtering;image segmentation;neural nets;object detection;object tracking;pose estimation;road vehicles;stereo image processing","feature-based lateral position estimation;surrounding vehicles;stereo vision;driver behavior prediction;advanced driver assistance systems;ADAS;computer vision;viewpoint change;occlusion;pixel-wise feature extraction;v-disparity;stereo depth map;ground detection;image thresholding;image filtering;camera image;deep convolutional neural network;speeded up robust feature;SURF;image frames;inverse perspective mapping;IPM;feature point detection;grounded feature point tracking","","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several MPCs are designed first considering the fact that the driver can avoid obstacles either by braking or moving to the left or right lanes. The control input to avoid the collision is calculated for each MPC such that its intervention can be minimized reflecting the driver's intention.

Traffic control methods that efficiently route traffic at intersections and interchanges also enhance the overall evacuation performance. This paper proposes an autonomous reservation-based intersection control (AReBIC) system for evacuation traffic control. The AReBIC system receives and processes reservation requests from approaching vehicles in real-time and routes them free of conflict. The results of a case study of Hampton Roads, Virginia, showed that the AReBIC system outperformed the existing traffic control practice in terms of mobility and safety. The average speeds increased by 29% and total delays reduced by 88% when intersection control was changed to the AReBIC system. The number of crossing conflicts decreased by 88% and lane change conflicts decreased by 47%.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995980","","Traffic control;Roads;Delays;Hurricanes;Trajectory;Autonomous vehicles","emergency management;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic control;storms","AReBIC system;autonomous reservation-based intersection control system;emergency evacuation;connected vehicle;autonomous vehicle;hurricane evacuation;evacuation traffic control;Hampton roads;Virginia","","","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The principle is to select, at each time, the best set (sensor, detector, landmark) to reach the fixed objective (accuracy and reliability) and thereafter to update the position of the vehicle by using an Extended Kalman Filter and the confidence by using a Bayesian Network. Each vehicle can share its position and its trajectory with the other vehicles in an absolute reference. Thus, a vehicle can track automatically a trajectory shared by another vehicle.

However, uncoordinated charging of mass EVs bring huge burden to power grids. To tackle this problem, a coordinated charging strategy of EVs is necessary. EV aggregator could play as a coordinator between EV owner and power grids, both meeting owner driving requirements and power grids operation requirements. However, a owner-aggregator economic inconsistency issue appears, that is EV owner get a higher charging cost in aggregator scheduling than self scheduling. In order to mediate owner-aggregator economic inconsistency issue, this paper designed a centralized two-stage EVs charging/discharging scheduling strategy in a residential community within 24 hours from the viewpoint of two stakeholders: EV owners (to minimize each EV owner charging cost) and aggregator (to maximize aggregator revenue). In the first-stage, EVs operation are scheduled from EV owners viewpoint, to obtain the minimal charging cost for each EV owner. Then, in the second-stage, the scheduling results in the first-stage are involved as constraints. The objective in the second-stage is to maximize aggregator revenue, without sacrificing each EV owner's economic benefit (no charging cost increment). A rebate factor is introduced in this model, which is the pay back for each EV owner provided by aggregator. Case study shows the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling strategy: the aggregator revenue is maximized without sacrificing each EV owner's economic benefit so that owner-aggregator economic inconsistency issue is mediated.

We developed a machine vision based framework to model driver's behavior by representing the gave dynamics over a time period using gaze fixations and transition frequencies. As a use case, we explore the driver's gaze patterns during maneuvers executed in freeway driving, namely, left lane change maneuver, right lane change maneuver and lane keep.

This article presents the results of an escooter pilot study conducted in Munich, Germany, in order to broaden the understanding of the low distribution and of the field of application, usage, and constraints this kind of vehicle is facing in a European city. Therefore this article gives a summary about the subject of low-powered two-wheelers. In order to analyze the gathered data, a method to minimize irregularities in completion of a trip diary is presented. Final results of this pilot study show that escooters are particularly utilizable for commuting and leisure trips and can thereby substitute up to 64% of average daily distances. Additionally, weather conditions as constraints for escooter usage are examined. Even with weather conditions prevailing in Central Europe, escooters can be used at 58% of days per year without weather adjusted gear.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995946","","Motorcycles;Europe;Urban areas;Automobiles;Bicycles;Engines;Economics","electric vehicles","escooter usability;urban environments;Central Europe;Munich;Germany;electric-powered two-wheelers;European markets;2-stroke engines;escooter pilot study;low-powered two-wheelers;parking shortage reduction;weather conditions;leisure trips","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thereby the vehicle speed resulting from the driver demand has a major influence on the energy consumption. Thus, if the individual speed profile of a driver can be predicted accurately, the energy demand of a vehicle for a given route can be estimated, enabling better range calculation and optimization strategies. However, the driver behavior depends on multidimensional input factors, varies from driver to driver and can change over time. In this paper a learning approach is proposed to predict the individual speed profile. This approach takes environmental influences on the driver behavior into account. Different artificial neural network models and a Kernel regression approach for driver velocity prediction are investigated. The learned models are evaluated on real drive data from different drivers on a specified route. Results show that Long Short-term Memory networks can predict the driver behavior very accurately, leading to small prediction error.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995770","","Vehicles;Predictive models;Training;Prediction algorithms;Kernel;Navigation;Biological system modeling","driver information systems;neural nets;regression analysis","driver velocity prediction;data-driven driver models;environmental features;driver behavior;vehicle energy demand calculation;vehicle optimization strategies;electric vehicles;vehicle speed;driver demand;energy consumption;speed profile;multidimensional input factors;artificial neural network models;Kernel regression;learned models;real drive data;long short-term memory networks;prediction error","","3","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In challenging but common tunnel environments, prolonged GNSS outages and unsustainable error accumulation of inertial sensors over time (e.g., gyroscopes) lead to the fast divergence of position estimates.

Traditionally, behavioral safety aspects are combined with mission-related tasks. The consequence may be unmanageable vehicle's complexity as well as unpredictable effects during the interaction with the environment leading to inapplicability of traditional safety assurance methods. Furthermore, real-time vehicle's hardware reliability assessment and management are often not considered. This paper introduces a novel simplified real-time environmental situation risk assessment approach for determination of required situational vehicle's reliability. Furthermore, the novel real-time vehicle's hardware reliability assessment and situational hardware structure and behavior control for vehicle's safe behavior assurance is presented. The introduced approach can verify vehicle's safe situational behavior by real-time environmental risk assessment and vehicle's hardware structure and emergency behavior control to minimize the situational risk.

Specifically, we employ Chamfer matching to register edges of road markings against a lightweight 3D map where road markings are represented as a set of sparse points. By only matching geometry of road markings, our localization algorithm further gains robustness against photometric appearance changes in the environment. We take vehicle odometry and epipolar geometry constraints into account and formulate a non-linear optimization problem to estimate the 6 DoF camera pose.

To extend the range of the environment representation, sharing the environment detections of multiple vehicles via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is a promising approach. In this paper, we present a method to fuse shared free space detections from multiple vehicles. The detections are represented as Parametric Free Space (PFS) maps, which are especially suitable for real-time radio V2V-transmission due to their compactness. A graph-based algorithm to fuse PFS maps is proposed that solves possible contradictions between the maps and incorporates the maps' uncertainty attributes. By solely operating on the contour, the fusion can be carried out by a simple path search in a fusion graph that is constructed from the maps. This results in an efficient method that finds the fusion result within few iterations. To account for possible errors in the relative poses between the PFS maps, we furthermore present an adapted Iterative Closest Point (ICP) matching to align the maps before the fusion. Therein we employ a modified soft-assign scheme for robust outlier rejection, and incorporate the PFS maps' boundary orientation to improve the matching process. We show the capabilities of our method by presenting results on real test drive data.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995843","","Aerospace electronics;Space vehicles;Fuses;Semantics;Sensors;Merging;Feature extraction","driver information systems;graph theory;sensor fusion;vehicular ad hoc networks","graph-based V2V free space fusion;driver assistance systems;automated driving;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;V2V communication;free space detection fusion;multiple vehicles;parametric free space maps;PFS map fusion;real-time radio V2V-transmission;graph-based algorithm;fusion graph;iterative closest point matching;ICP matching;modified soft-assign scheme;robust outlier rejection","","2","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first layer, which computes the operating points optimal in steady-state conditions is based on the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS). During transient phases, a second control layer allows to reduce pollutant peaks by smoothing the engine torque trajectory.

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model have been widely utilized for predicting traffic information since it is appropriate to represent the non-linear characteristics inherent in traffic prediction. However, the MLP model doesn't reflect local dependencies of traffic data and is prone to noise in traffic data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based model, on the other hand, can capture the local dependencies of traffic data and is less prone to disturbance in data.

In this contribution, an approach for the model-based development of transmission concepts for PHEVs is presented.

This paper proposes a new structure of map which is a multilayer 2D vector map and localization methods based on multi-channel LiDAR. Proposed map is extremely small in size comparing to 3D point cloud maps while preserving the localization accuracy. As this 2D map is generated by accumulating different layers of buildings, it has less uncertainty. Further, this map provides more features for map matching comparing to the conventional 2D maps and as a result, the accuracy of localization is improved. On the other hand, vector structure of the map bring more precise NDT (normal distribution transform) representation and as a result, more accurate matching.

Here we propose a data-driven modeling approach to capture the lane change decision behavior of human drivers. We collect data with a test vehicle in typical lane change situations and train classifiers to predict the instant of lane change initiation with respect to the preferences of a particular driver.

Green routing is one such connected vehicle strategy under which drivers receive information about the most fuel-efficient route before departing for a given destination. This paper introduces an evaluation framework for estimating the benefits of green routing based on large-scale, real-world travel data. The framework has the capability to quantify fuel savings by estimating the fuel consumption on alternate routes that could be taken between two locations and comparing these to the estimated fuel consumption of the actual route taken. A route-based fuel consumption estimation model that considers road traffic conditions, functional class, and grade is proposed and used in the framework. A study using a large-scale, high-resolution data set from the California Household Travel Survey indicates that 31% of actual routes have fuel savings potential, and among these routes the cumulative fuel savings could reach 12%. Alternately calculating the potential fuel savings relative to the full set of actual routes (including those that already follow the greenest route recommendation), the potential savings relative to the overall estimated fuel consumption would be 4.5%. Notably, two thirds of the fuel savings occur on green routes that save both fuel and time relative to the original actual routes. The remaining third would be subject to weighing the potential fuel savings against required increases in travel time for the recommended green route.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995882","","Roads;Routing;Estimation;Green products;Vehicles;Fuel economy","energy consumption;environmental factors;fuel economy;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;transportation","green routing fuel saving opportunity assessment;connected vehicle;automated vehicle;energy efficiency;environmental impact;transportation systems;route-based fuel consumption estimation model;road traffic conditions;functional class;California Household Travel Survey;cumulative fuel savings","","1","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite of several reliable traffic light state detection approaches in literature, traffic light state recognition still remains an open problem due to outdoor perception challenge which includes occlusions, illumination and scale variations. This paper presents a vision-based traffic light structure detection and convolutional neural network (CNN) based state recognition method, which is robust under different illumination and weather conditions. In the first step, traffic light candidate regions are generated by performing HSV based color segmentation, which are then filtered out using shape and area analysis. Further, in order to incorporate the structural information of traffic light in diverse background scenarios, Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) approach is employed, which helps to localize the correct traffic light structure in the image. To further validate the traffic light candidate regions, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features are extracted for each region and traffic light structures are validated using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

We propose a two-step Sweep-to-Sweep Motion Estimation and Sweep-to-Map Registration framework that compensates for the distortion of the point cloud, estimates the vehicle's motion and generates a 3D map of the world. The rotating motion of LiDAR and the longitudinal motion of the vehicle together create an inherent distortion in relative motions observed in each scan per sweep. Hence applying the same translation and rotation values to the entire sweep does not guarantee the optimum estimation for LiDAR's relative motion from sweep to sweep. Therefore, the key idea in this paper is to obtain accurate localization of the vehicle by processing LiDAR sweep in a batch-wise fashion followed by 3D Map Registration using Iterative Closest Point (ICP). To reduce drift in localization ICP utilizes local map information in a radius of about 100m from the position of vehicle. Our main contribution is to introduce an innovative CPU-only pipeline for simultaneous localization and mapping that runs real-time on Intel architecture. We have tested our algorithm by processing every sweep from Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR at about 50ms on vehicle moving at speeds up-to 25mph in urban roads and parking lot structures.

In contrast to traditional traffic engineering approaches, our approach gives agency and decision-making influence to individual drivers and exploits auction mechanisms to make traffic control decisions. Drivers make payments to their corresponding movement managers (each responsible for a particular directional flow through the intersection), and movement managers then compete for control of the signal. These financial transactions, if treated literally provide an alternate source of funding transportation infrastructure. Previous work with this model has demonstrated the ability to achieve better overall traffic flow performance than actuated control, a simple adaptive traffic signal control strategy based on detection and monitoring of waiting vehicles. Here we consider the design and analysis of bidding strategies capable of factoring in a given driver's value of time (VOT), as indicated by the amount of voluntary contributions that are made on top of the fixed fee that every driver is charged. We analyze the potential for expediting high VOT drivers without undue disruption of overall traffic flows.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995888","","Vehicles;Delays;Economics;Safety;Discharges (electric);Robots","adaptive control;decision making;road traffic control;transportation","market-driven traffic signal control;traffic engineering approaches;decision-making;traffic control decisions;financial transactions;transportation infrastructure;traffic flow performance;adaptive traffic signal control strategy;waiting vehicle monitoring;waiting vehicle detection;VOT drivers","","2","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the key problems is nonholonomic path planning in maze-like environments (e.g. parking lots). To balance efficiency and passenger comfort, the planner needs to minimize the length of the path as well as the number of gear shifts. Lattice A* search is widely adopted for optimal path planning. However, existing heuristics do not evaluate the nonholonomic dynamic constraint and the collision avoidance constraint simultaneously, which may mislead the search. To efficiently search the environment, the boundary layer heuristic is proposed which puts large cost in the area that the vehicle must shift gear to escape. Such area is called the boundary layer. A simple and efficient geometric method to compute the boundary layer is proposed. The admissibility and consistency of the additive combination of the boundary layer heuristic and existing heuristics are proved in the paper. The simulation results verify that the introduction of the boundary layer heuristic improves the search performance by reducing the computation time by 56.1%.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995819","","Gears;Path planning;Lattices;Vehicle dynamics;Nickel;Collision avoidance;Search problems","collision avoidance;geometry;intelligent transportation systems","boundary layer heuristic;search-based nonholonomic path planning;maze-like environments;automatic valet parking;autonomous driving;gear shifts;lattice A* search;collision avoidance;geometric method","","1","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance is characterized using CAM CCDFs which serves as a base for the evaluation of a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control application. Two important effects has been identified that affect to the reliability of the communications. Firstly, there is a degradation with the distance that appears to be stronger for cars and more gentle for trucks. This indicates that occlusions heavily affect the connectivity of ITS-G5A.

While simple predictions, e.g. based on assuming constant velocity, may suffice for deciding a driving strategy, predicting the set of all possible behaviors is required to ensure safe motion plans. In this work, we propose a novel tool for the latter problem based on reachability analysis: Set-Based Prediction Of Traffic Participants (SPOT). Our tool can predict the future occupancy of other traffic participants, including all possible maneuvers (e.g. full acceleration, full braking, and arbitrary lane changes), by considering physical constraints and assuming that the traffic participants abide by the traffic rules. However, we remove assumptions for each traffic participant individually as soon as a violation of a traffic rule is detected. Removal of assumptions automatically results in larger occupancies and thus a smaller drivable area for the ego vehicle, ensuring that the ego vehicle does not cause a collision during the time horizon of the prediction. Experimental results show that we obtain the set of future occupancies within a fraction of the prediction horizon.

Point-cloud map-based localization methods enable autonomous vehicles to accurately estimate their own positions. However, accurate localization and “matching error” estimations cannot be performed when the appearance of the environment changes, and this is common in rural environments. To cope with these inaccuracies, in this work, we propose to estimate the error of NDT scan matching beforehand (off-line). Then, as the vehicle navigates in the environment, the appropriate uncertainty is assigned to the scan matching. 3D NDT scan matching utilizes the uncertainty information that is estimated off-line, and is combined with a road-marker matching approach using a particle-filtering algorithm. As a result, accurate localization can be performed in areas in which 3D NDT failed. In addition, the uncertainty of the localization is reduced. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995900","","Three-dimensional displays;Convergence;Uncertainty;Robustness;Roads;Iterative closest point algorithm;Wheels","image matching;normal distribution;optical radar;particle filtering (numerical methods);road vehicles;traffic engineering computing;transforms","3D NDT scan matching;road marker matching;point-cloud matching method;normal distribution transform;light detection and ranging intensity;point-cloud map-based localization;autonomous vehicles;matching error estimations;particle-filtering algorithm","","10","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of such tasks is the planning of safe trajectories with the simultaneous intervention in both the longitudinal and the lateral dynamics of the vehicle in complex traffic-scenarios with multiple static and dynamic objects. A recently proposed hybrid statistical learning approach uses a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-ConvNet) to predict suitable longitudinal acceleration profiles in combination with an RRT variant called the Augmented CL-RRT algorithm. This algorithm is not effective in complex traffic-scenarios, i.e., traffic scenarios with more than 4 dynamic objects, because of the lack of flexibility and biasing in the longitudinal and the lateral dynamics intervention, respectively. Therefore, an extension to the Augmented CL-RRT algorithm is introduced to improve the longitudinal dynamics intervention with actuator and stable profile constraints and named as the Augmented CL-RRT+ algorithm. A biased-sampling strategy is also proposed based on the predicted longitudinal acceleration and steering wheel angle profiles provided by a trained 3D-ConvNet. Simulations are performed to compare different trajectory planning algorithms based on efficiency and safety. The results show vast improvements in terms of the efficiency without harming the safety.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995735","","Acceleration;Trajectory;Heuristic algorithms;Vehicle dynamics;Planning;Prediction algorithms;Roads","convolution;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;steering systems;traffic engineering computing;trees (mathematics);vehicle dynamics","machine learning;biased-sampling approach;safe trajectory planning;complex traffic;dynamic traffic;rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm;hybrid statistical learning;3D convolutional neural network;3D-ConvNet;longitudinal acceleration profiles;augmented CL-RRT algorithm;lateral dynamics intervention;longitudinal dynamics intervention;actuator;biased-sampling strategy;steering wheel angle profiles","","1","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, these technologies can enhance the efficiency of drivers/vehicles' decision-making by managing and coordinating the interactions among human-driven and connected, automated vehicles. Such management and coordination can lead to developing a collaborative connected, automated driving environment. Game theory, as a methodology to model the outcome of the interactions among multiple players, is a perfect tool to characterize the interaction between these vehicles. One of the most challenging maneuvers to model is drivers/vehicles' tactical decisions at intersections. Focusing on unprotected left turn maneuvers, this study aims at developing a game theory based framework to characterize driver behavior in unprotected left turn maneuvers in a connected, automated driving environment. A two-person non-zero-sum non-cooperative game under complete information is selected to model the underlying decision-making. NGSIM data is used to calibrate the payoff functions based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Validation results indicate that this framework can effectively capture vehicle interactions when performing conflicting turning movements while achieving a relatively high accuracy in predicting vehicles' real choice.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995894","","Games;Acceleration;Vehicles;Game theory;Turning","behavioural sciences computing;decision making;game theory;maximum likelihood estimation;traffic engineering computing","collaborative connected automated driving environment;game theory based decision framework;unprotected left turn maneuvers;transportation systems;driver behavior;two-person nonzero-sum noncooperative game;maximum likelihood estimation","","2","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then examine the intersection usage statistics in the area and select only the most frequently used intersections locations for RSU deployment.

However, in urban traffic environments, autonomous vehicles need wider field of view to perceive surrounding things and stuff, especially at intersections. This paper describes a CNN-based semantic segmentation solution using fisheye camera which covers a large field of view. To handle the complex scene in the fisheye image, Overlapping Pyramid Pooling (OPP) module is proposed to explore local, global and pyramid local region context information. Based on the OPP module, a network structure called OPP-net is proposed for semantic segmentation. The net is trained and evaluated on a fisheye image dataset for semantic segmentation which is generated from an existing dataset of urban traffic scenes. In addition, zoom augmentation, a novel data augmentation policy specially designed for fisheye image, is proposed to improve the net's generalization performance. Experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of the OPP-net for urban traffic scenes and the effectiveness of the zoom augmentation.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995725","","Semantics;Image segmentation;Cameras;Kernel;Neural networks;Autonomous vehicles;Roads","cameras;feedforward neural nets;image segmentation;mobile robots;robot vision;traffic engineering computing","CNN based semantic segmentation;urban traffic scenes;fisheye camera;visual scene understanding;autonomous driving;convolutional neural network;narrow-angle pinhole camera;wide-angle pinhole camera;urban traffic environments;autonomous vehicles;field of view;overlapping pyramid pooling module;OPP module;global region context information;pyramid local region context information;OPP-net;fisheye image dataset;zoom augmentation;data augmentation policy;net generalization performance","","2","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in some situations such a map may be invalid and therefore unusable. This can be a driving area which was never mapped or regions where the map is outdated because the environment has changed. The following paper addresses the problem of building a road model without using a map by only fusing measurements from different sensors mounted on the ego vehicle. As sensor measurements various information like lane markings painted on the ground, the position of other cars or occupancy grids can be used. They are transformed into a grid-based model and a geometrical description is extracted out of this model by the use of a novel path-planning based method.

In this paper, we present a novel learning-based method to efficiently estimate other vehicles' intentions and interact with them in ramp merging scenarios, without over-the-air communication between vehicles. The intention estimate is generated from a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) which organizes historical data and latent intentions and determines predictions. Real driving trajectories are used to learn transition models in the PGM. Thus, besides the structure of the PGM, our method does not require human-designed reward or cost functions. The PGM-based intention estimation is followed by an off-the-shelf ACC distance keeping model to generate proper acceleration/deceleration commands. The PGM plays a plug-in role in our self-driving framework [1]. We validate the performance of our method both on real merging data and using a designed merging strategy in simulation, and show significant improvements compared with previous methods. Parameter design is also discussed by experiments. The new method is computationally efficient, and does not require acceleration information about other vehicles, which is hard to read directly from sensors mounted on the autonomous vehicle.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995935","","Merging;Automobiles;Acceleration;Estimation;Autonomous automobiles;Graphical models;Cost function","adaptive control;automobiles;digital simulation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;sensors;statistical distributions;traffic engineering computing","intention estimation;ramp merging control;autonomous driving;cooperative driving behavior;lane changing;intersection navigation;autonomous vehicles;learning-based method;ramp merging scenarios;probabilistic graphical model;PGM;historical data;latent intentions;real driving trajectories;transition model learning;ACC distance keeping model;acceleration/deceleration command generation;self-driving framework;real merging data;merging strategy;simulation;sensors;adaptive cruise control","","13","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed parking scheme allows vehicles to park either perpendicular to the driveway or in double-ended queues with k parking spots (k-deque) on the side of the driving lane. Leveraging the potential of such a layout increases the capacity of a parking lot by up to 25 %, while keeping the maximum number of shunts per car below [k/2] +1 between entry and exit.

Therefore, it is considered as a fundamental requirement for such systems. The accuracy of Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS), one of the main vehicle-based 3D laser scanning technologies, is significantly degraded due to the blockage of GPS signals in deep urban areas where tall buildings are surrounding streets. Existing solutions for the adjustment of the MMS data which require a manual measurement of the Ground Control Points (GCP) are labor-intensive and costly. In this paper, a fully-automatic framework for the calibration of the MMS is presented which corrects the 3D laser scanning data based on the road markings extracted from the aerial surveillance data. The proposed framework consists of three main steps: road marking extraction from aerial data, road marking extraction from the MMS point cloud, and the registration of the MMS road markings to the aerial reference. For the registration, a method based on the dynamic sliding window is introduced. The experimental results of the Hitotsubashi intersection in Tokyo demonstrate that the proposed method is practical for the MMS calibration in the urban area and it could achieve a pixel-level accuracy, where the Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) of the airborne image was 12cm.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995873","","Roads;Three-dimensional displays;Buildings;Data mining;Surveillance;Image color analysis;Measurement by laser beam","cartography;feature extraction","3D mobile laser scanning;automatic calibration;aerial surveillance data;precise urban mapping;mobile mapping systems;vehicle-based 3D laser scanning technologies;ground control points;GCP;MMS road markings;MMS point cloud;road marking extraction;dynamic sliding window;Hitotsubashi intersection;Tokyo;Japan;pixel-level accuracy;ground sampling distance;GSD","","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The idea is to understand the traffic phase by learning the moving features of road users. Moving features are extracted and labeled according to two traffic signal lights (i.e., green, red) and different learning methods such as K Nearest Neighborhood (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are applied on training data.

A novel scene-based particle filtering algorithm is used to estimate and track the steering angle using images obtained from a monocular camera. Highly accurate proposal distributions and likelihood are modeled for the second order particle filter, at the scene-level, using deep learning. For every road scene, an individual proposal distribution and likelihood model is learnt for the corresponding particle filter. The proposal distribution is modeled using a novel long short term memory network-mixture-of-expert-based regression framework. To facilitate the learning of highly accurate proposal distributions, each road scene is partitioned into straight driving, left turning and right turning sub-partitions. Subsequently, each expert in the regression framework accurately model the expert driver's behavior within a specific partition of the given road scene. Owing to the accuracy of the modelled proposal distributions, the steering angle is robustly tracked, even with a limited number of sampled particles. The sampled particles are assigned importance weights using a deep learning-based likelihood. The likelihood is modeled with a convolutional neural network and extra trees-based regression framework, which predicts the steering angle for a given image. We validate our proposed algorithm using multiple sequences. We perform a detailed parameter analysis and a comparative analysis of our proposed algorithm with different baseline algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can robustly track the steering angles with few particles in real-time even for challenging scenes.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995709","","Proposals;Roads;Prediction algorithms;Turning;Neural networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Markov processes","cameras;computer vision;image filtering;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;roads;steering systems;trees (mathematics)","monocular camera;real-time vision-based filtering algorithm;steering angle estimation;autonomous driving;scene-based particle filtering algorithm;likelihood model;distribution model;road scene;memory network-mixture-of-expert-based regression framework;right turning sub-partitions;left turning sub-partitions;deep learning-based likelihood;convolutional neural network;trees-based regression framework","","2","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This makes techniques important that allow to obtain a dense but still approximative representation of a desired 2D structure (e.g., depth maps, optical flow, disparity maps) from a very sparse measurement of this structure. The method presented here exploits the complete information given by the principal component analysis (PCA), the principal basis and its prior distribution. The method is able to determine a dense reconstruction even if only a very sparse measurement is available. When facing such situations, typically the number of principal components is further reduced which results in a loss of expressiveness of the basis. We overcome this problem and inject prior knowledge in a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach.

To test this assumption, N = 17 drivers completed two simulator drives, once with ('Speech + generic') and once without additional speech output (`Generic'). Having interacted with the automated system in different scenarios (i.e., letting the system execute a maneuver vs. taking over control from the vehicle), drivers completed comparative questionnaires on trust, anthropomorphism and usability. The applied questionnaire on trust in automation was structured after theoretical implications and derived from previous research on trust in automation. Results showed that the `Speech + generic' system was rated as superior for all three attitude measures compared to the `Generic' system.

By firing high-rate laser beams, a LiDAR device is able to project its surroundings as 2D or 3D point cloud, which can be used for different purposes such as object detection, map generation, localization, and navigation. Autonomous vehicles are often equipped with at least one multi-layer LiDAR sensor with 360-degree coverage to include as much information as possible in the point cloud. Such a device generates enormous amount of data which poses a challenge for data storage, real-time computation, and data transmission, as autonomous vehicles are typically resource-constrained systems. This paper proposes a lightweight and adaptive point cloud data structure to reduce the size of a 3D point cloud. The suggested data structure can be flexibly configured with different parameters to adapt for precision, distance coverage, and reflectivity resolution. The precision of the data structure is evaluated using a 16-layer Velodyne LiDAR sensor (VLP-16) to collect data in the city area of AstaZero proving ground and Gothenburg downtown. Our results show that the adaptive data structure can consume only 1/8th of the original point cloud size and hence, it is particularly suitable for applications with limited hardware resources or certain tolerance to precision of the point cloud.

In contrast to radar sensors, laser scanners provide precise spatial information, which can be used to identify critical traffic situations and trigger reversible or irreversible safety systems. As a consequence, already small errors in sensor data measurements could lead to severe accidents. The performance of surround sensors depends on the ambient atmosphere and weather condition. It is known that rain and fog have negative influence and leads to signal degradation. In winter time or cold climate, the ambient air temperature requires less moisture to attain high relative humidity or to become saturated. Therefore, the hot exhaust gases of vehicles are condensed instantly and can be seen as a distinct mass of fog. To the best of our knowledge, nobody has investigated effects of exhaust gases at low temperatures on sensor quality so far. Based on static and dynamic tests at different temperatures, we have shown that exhaust gases are visible for laser scanners and lead to degraded performance.

Vegetation in off-road environments poses great challenges to this task. Usually, vegetation should not be considered as obstacles for off-road UGVs since they are soft and drivable. On the other hand, there are also possibilities that real obstacles exist in the vegetation, which makes the problem difficult. In this paper, a novel multi-spectrum data fusion based algorithm for partial occluded obstacle detection under complex vegetation environment is proposed. First a RGB and Near-infrared (NIR) multi-spectrum superpixel based segmentation strategy is employed to accurately segment the objects in the image. Obstacle candidate superpixels are then obtained through simple geometric computation in 3D laser data. Finally, the heterogeneous texture and 3D features are extracted from each candidate superpixel and fed in Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish the real obstacles from vegetation. Experimental results on real data acquired from various vegetation environments demonstrate our success.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995877","","Vegetation mapping;Three-dimensional displays;Image segmentation;Laser radar;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Clustering algorithms","collision avoidance;feature extraction;geometry;image segmentation;mobile robots;object detection;remotely operated vehicles;robust control;sensor fusion;support vector machines;vegetation","multispectrum superpixel based obstacle detection;vegetation environments;unmanned ground vehide;UGV;off-road environments;multispectrum data fusion based algorithm;RGB near-infrared multispectrum superpixel based segmentation strategy;NIR;object image segmentation;geometric computation;3D laser data;heterogeneous texture;3D feature extraction;support vector machine;SVM;robust obstacle detection","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The solution will satisfy both differential and obstacle imposed constraints and is intended either as a part of an autonomous system or as a driver support system to automatically plan complicated maneuvers in backward and forward motion. The proposed framework relies on a precomputing step that is performed offline to generate a finite set of kinematically feasible motion primitives. These motion primitives are then used to create a regular state lattice that can be searched for a solution using standard graph-search algorithms. To make this graph-search problem tractable for real-time applications a novel parametrization of the reachable state space is proposed where each motion primitive moves the system from and to a selected set of circular equilibrium configurations.

One way to reduce this test load is virtual testing or hardware in-the-loop testing. The major challenge is to create realistic test cases that closely resemble the situation on the road. We present a way to use data of naturalistic driving to generate test cases for Monte-Carlo simulations of ADS.

In this paper, we propose a supervised learning-based approach to detect dynamic points in consideration of noisy input data. First of all, to consider depth ambiguity that proportionally increases according to the distance to the ego-vehicle, we divide the XZ-plane (bird-eye view) into several subregions. Then, we train a random forest for each subregion by constructing motion vectors computed based on two motion metrics. Here, in order to reduce errors of the input data, the motion vectors are filtered based on a pairwise planarity check and then filtered motion vectors are used for training.

This rasterization step loses information that could be retained if new methods were developed that work directly on the LiDAR point could for feature extraction and mapping, without rasterization. This article presents one such approach that operates on a road surface point cloud, processing small patches at a time using a locally adaptive version of Otsu's method to discard low intensity reflections while retaining reflections from roadway markings. The main new aspect of the approach is a graph-based clustering algorithm implemented directly on the point cloud.

When visual feedback is limited or only partial road is visible, driver steering performance declines. To solve this problem, haptic feedback is expected to assist drivers by providing guidance torque on the steering wheel. This paper focuses on the effect of haptic guidance on driver steering performance during curve negotiation when visual feedback is limited. Twelve subjects participated in the experiment conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Levels of haptic guidance were none, weak, and strong, and levels of visual feedback were whole, near, medium and far. The steering performance was assessed by drivers' turning maneuver when approaching and leaving curves, and time-to-lane crossing during curves. Results indicate that mean value of time-to-lane crossing decreased due to the implementation of strong haptic guidance when visual feedback was limited. The start point of turning maneuver was earlier resulting from the implementation of strong haptic guidance under the condition of visual feedback from near segment. In conclusion, the drivers tended to rely on haptic guidance to achieve better steering performance when visual feedback was limited.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995784","","Haptic interfaces;Visualization;Vehicles;Roads;Torque;Turning;Wheels","driver information systems;haptic interfaces","limited visual feedback;car steering;haptic feedback;driver assistance;guidance torque;steering wheel;driver steering performance;curve negotiation;high-fidelity driving simulator;visual feedback levels;driver turning maneuver;approaching curves;leaving curves;time-to-lane crossing","","4","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Easy, smooth driving depends on drivers' awareness to develop situation-specific expectations, where infrequent or unexpected situations are not taken into account. Understanding these unexpected situations provides important insight on driver situation awareness and accident prevention. This study takes advantage of recent development of wearable devices and uses driver physiological signals to identify such unexpected situations during driver hard brake. Based on a naturalistic driving dataset, we define two types of hard brake behavior: reactive and intended hard brake. The reactive hard brake relates to drivers reacting to unexpected situations that usually leads to deviated physiological signals due to stress. The intended hard brake relates to planned maneuver implementation that consists of stable physiological signals. By using the human evaluation, we identified the different situations in which these two types of hard brake occurs. Clear difference is observed between these two groups of situations. Our goal is to identify features that are representative of these two type of road environment, especially the situations where unexpected reactive hard brake happens. Following this direction, we extracted features from Lidar depth scanner to represent the road scene, and applied both lasso regression and logistic regression classifier for feature analysis. The regression model achieves high correlation of 0.77 between the prediction and the ground truth while the classification achieves F-score of 0.76.

For an autonomous agent, it is fundamental to understand what other drivers are doing before deciding their own manoeuvres. These are seldom be the same as intersections differ and the situations too. Whilst, learning techniques can be used to process features of trajectories and to predict manoeuvres of others cars. The problem with such approaches is the difficult process of recording data for each intersection, not only of the subject vehicle but of the other vehicles. To address this problem, a hybrid data set was constructed. It is built in a simulated environment and completed with real data after has driven multiple times across the intersection. To analyze these data, classification technique is used to find the common range of features for each manoeuvre. Random forest classifiers are used in conjunction with our functional discretization to analyze the trajectories of cars approaching an intersection. The classifiers can determine the longitudinal manoeuvre as well as the direction. We show how our approach performs compared to other classifiers and space discretization. In addition, we demonstrate the impact and the usefulness of the mixture between simulated and real data.

In this paper we show that semantic knowledge can be obtained from a radar grid by classifying the containing objects on the cell level.

However, due to imperfect control and sensing, the actual state of the vehicle cannot be flawlessly predicted or measured, but estimated with uncertainty. Therefor, it is important to consider the execution risk advance in motion planning for a solution with a high success rate. The Space Exploration Guided Heuristic Search (SEHS) method is extended to deal with perception and control uncertainty in its two planning stages. First, the localization uncertainty is evaluated with a simple probabilistic robot model by the Space Exploration to find a path corridor with sufficient localization quality for the desired motion accuracy. Then, a trajectory controller is modeled with nonholonomic kinematics for the belief propagation of a robot state with primitive motions. The dynamic model and the control feedback are approximated in a close neighborhood of the reference trajectory. In this case, the Heuristic Search can propagate the state uncertainty as a normal distribution in the search tree to guarantee a high probability of safety and to achieve the required final accuracy. The belief-based SEHS is evaluated in several simulated scenarios. Compared to the basic SEHS method that assumes perfection, motions with higher execution successful rate are produced, especially the human-like behaviors for driving through narrow passages and precise parking. This confirms the major contribution of this work in exploiting the uncertainties for motion planning in autonomous driving.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995801","","Uncertainty;Robot sensing systems;Planning;Space exploration;Kalman filters","automobiles;feedback;normal distribution;path planning;risk management;road safety;robot dynamics;robot kinematics;search problems;trajectory control;uncertain systems","motion planning;perception;control uncertainties;space exploration guided heuristic search;reliability;safety;autonomous driving;real traffic scenarios;execution risk advance;localization uncertainty;probabilistic robot model;path corridor;localization quality;motion accuracy;trajectory controller;nonholonomic kinematics;belief propagation;robot state;primitive motions;dynamic model;control feedback;reference trajectory close neighborhood;state uncertainty propagation;normal distribution;search tree;belief-based SEHS;narrow passages;precise parking","","2","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first method is object candidate filtering by analyzing the disparity values inside an object candidate. The second method applies the relative positioning filter. Using the depth measurement obtained from the disparity image as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration, a three dimensional distance from an object to the vehicle can be calculated. Based on known real world traffic light locations, the filter is able to suppress thirty to seventy percent of false positives while only decreasing the detection rate by one percent. This result shows the huge potential for range filtering in traffic light recognition in general. The third method is the hypothesis size enhancement when re-projecting a hypothesis into the image. This process is enabled by a real world traffic light model in conjunction with the depth measurement. It is shown that all true positive hypotheses will benefit from this technique, resulting in a massively better overlap with the ground truth labels. When evaluated frame wise, re-projection can improve detection rate by up to fifteen percent. This work primarily enhances traffic light hypotheses obtained by a baseline detector and thus requires a hypothesis disparity value.

However, the conventional CNN models have a high computational cost and require high memory capacity, which is impractical and unaffordable for commercial applications such as real-time on-road object detection on embedded boards or mobile platforms. To tackle this limitation of CNN models, this paper proposes a wide-residual-inception (WR-Inception) network, which constructs the architecture based on a residual inception unit that captures objects of various sizes on the same feature map, as well as shallower and wider layers, compared to state-of-the-art networks like ResNets. To verify the proposed networks, this paper conducted two experiments; one is a classification task on CIFAR-10/100 and the other is an on-road object detection task using a Single-Shot Multi-box Detector (SSD) on the KITTI dataset.

The methods will be investigated for the personalization of an intersection assistant, which we are currently developing. We start with the hypothesis that the size that constitutes an acceptable gap is driver-dependent. To test this hypothesis, we have performed a simulator study with 9 participants. The results reveal that there is a significant inter-individual difference in the critical gap between the drivers, as postulated. Next we investigate how well we can predict which gap the driver will take when we use the previously estimated personalized critical gap versus a driver independent one. Using the personalized gap compared to a driver independent one reduces the error from 11.8 % to 9 8 %. These results are a clear indication that personalization can be utilized to increase the effectiveness and usability of an intersection assistant.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995776","","Roads;Maximum likelihood estimation;Automobiles;Turning;Bayes methods","maximum likelihood estimation;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","maximum likelihood method;driver-specific critical-gap estimation;ML method;intersection assistant;simulator study;personalized critical gap","","5","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our scale correction scheme combines cues from both dense and sparse ground plane estimation; this makes the proposed method robust towards varying availability and distribution of trackable ground structure. Instead of optimizing the parameters of the ground plane related homography, we parametrize and optimize the underlying motion parameters directly. Furthermore, we employ classifiers to detect scale outliers based on various features (e.g. moments on residuals).

However, this approach requires a higher number of cameras to be considered in the optimization: in practice, more than 30 cameras are necessary, while a typical vision-only BA can succeed with as few as 10 cameras. This problem dimensionality makes the method unsuitable for autonomous embedded platforms of low computational capacity (e.g. MAVs). In this paper, we present a hybrid constrained BA/pose-graph approach using BTO, which is motivated by theoretical observations about covariance changes as a function of the gauge. We show that our method has desirable properties that allows its successful use in a BTO context, and present two different formulations. The experimental validation of our method shows that both our formulations reduce the computational cost in comparison with constrained BA using BTO, without any significant loss of precision. In particular, our first formulation yields a 60% reduction in execution time.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995957","","Cameras;Optimization;Global Positioning System;Minimization;Three-dimensional displays;Pose estimation","Global Positioning System;graph theory;image fusion;image reconstruction;optimisation;pose estimation;robot vision;SLAM (robots)","hybrid bundle adjustment/pose-graph approach;VSLAM/GPS fusion;low-capacity platforms;real-time fusion;monocular visual SLAM;GPS data;city-scale georeferenced pose estimations;pose reconstructions;constrained local key-frame;barrier term optimization;BTO;vision-only BA;hybrid constrained BA/pose-graph approach;visual simultaneous localization and mapping","","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here a variant of a fully convolutional network is proposed to predict a pixel-wise semantic labeling of (i) free-space, (ii) on-road unexpected obstacles, and (iii) background.

As a result, developing efficient methods of compressing cloud point data has become an urgent task. Current methods compress the data directly using tree structures or height map-based methods. Taking into consideration the specialized requirements of autonomous driving, in [1] we proposed a method of compressing raw point cloud data using image compression methods and obtained superior results. Image compression-based methods are not able to utilize the 3D characteristics of point clouds, however.

Proposed method can take advantage of the 3D characteristic of point cloud by a predicting process which simulating the working procedure of 3D LiDAR. Strategies from MPEG and DPCM compression are utilized and several issues which can affect performance are discussed.

Training classifiers for this task would not be possible without the existence of large datasets of pixelwise labeled images. Manually annotating a large number of images is an expensive and time consuming process. In this paper, we propose a new semi-automatic annotation tool for scene labeling tailored for autonomous driving. This tool significantly reduces the effort of the annotator and also the time spent to annotate the data, while at the same time it offers the necessary features to produce precise pixel-level semantic labeling. The main contribution of our work represents the development of a complex annotation framework able to generate automatic annotations for 20 classes, which the user can control and modify accordingly.

Hence, in this paper, we focus on improving the late-fusion scheme for pedestrian classification on the Daimler stereo vision data set. Each image modality, Intensity, Depth and Flow, is classified by an independent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the outputs of which are then fused by a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) before the recognition decision. We propose different methods based on Cross-Modality deep learning of CNNs: (1) a correlated model where a unique CNN is trained with Intensity, Depth and Flow images for each frame, (2) an incremental model where a CNN is trained with the first modality images frames, then a second CNN, initialized by transfer learning on the first one is trained on the second modality images frames, and finally a third CNN initialized on the second one, is trained on the last modality images frames. The experiments show that the incremental cross-modality deep learning of CNNs improves classification performances not only for each independent modality classifier, but also for the multi-modality classifier based on late-fusion.

Local structure and context are captured from both monocular color and depth modalities in the form of image channels. We define multiple channel types at three different levels: low, intermediate and high order channels. The low order channels are computed using a multimodal multiresolution filtering scheme and capture structure and color information from lower receptive fields. For the intermediate order channels, we employ deep convolutional channels that are able to capture more complex structures, having a larger receptive field. The high order channels are scale invariant channels that consist of spatial, geometric and semantic channels. These channels are enhanced by additional pyramidal context channels, capturing context at multiple levels. The semantic segmentation is achieved by a boosting based classification scheme over superpixels using multi-range channel features and pyramidal context features. A pre-segmentation is used to generate semantic channels as input for more powerful final segmentation. The final segmentation is refined using a superpixel-level dense conditional random field. The proposed solution is evaluated on the Cityscapes segmentation benchmark and achieves competitive results at low computational costs.

Our approach focuses entirely on the sparse distance and reflectance measurements generated by a LiDAR sensor. The main contribution of this paper is a combined segmentation and upsampling technique that preserves the important semantical structure of the scene. Data from the point cloud is segmented and projected onto a virtual camera image where a series of image processing steps are applied in order to reconstruct a fully sampled depth image. We achieve this by means of a multilateral filter that is guided into regions of distinct objects in the segmented point cloud. Thus, the gains of the proposed approach are two-fold: measurement noise in the original data is suppressed and missing depth values are reconstructed to arbitrary resolution. Objective evaluation in an automotive application shows state-of-the-art accuracy of our reconstructed depth images. Finally, we show the qualitative value of our images by training and evaluating a RGBD pedestrian detection system.

This paper introduces a flexible and extendible mobility model - to represent a user's movement and habits - using a Variable-order Markov Model (VOMM) based on users' mobility patterns enriched with different temporal context information. Since this model uses a tree like data structure, it is possible to find patterns of different lengths in the same training data.

The user interface is designed using a hand posture and gesture recognition algorithm in deep learning framework. The hand posture recognition algorithm is formulated using the convolutional neural network to perform the fundamental tasks in the user interface. The hand gesture recognition algorithm is formulated using the long-term recurrent convolutional neural network to intuitively interact with the touchless automotive user interface in a detailed manner. In the recurrent deep learning framework, typically, the gesture frames are taken from a uniformly sampled image sequence. In this work, the recurrent structure is enhanced using a reduced number of input frames captured from the image sequence. The reduced input frames or key frames represent the action present in the video sequence. Sparse dictionary learning provide reliable key frame extraction from video sequences. However, sparse dictionary learning is computationally expensive, and are individually optimized for every video sequence. In this paper, we propose to approximate sparse dictionary learning using a non-linear regression framework. The multilayer perceptron is utilized to model the non-linear regression framework. The optimal neural network architecture is identified after a detailed evaluation. We evaluate the proposed recognition methods on public datasets. The proposed methods yield a recognition accuracy of 92% and 90% for pose and gestures, respectively. The combined hand posture and gesture recognition takes 82ms which is a reasonable for real time implementation.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995825","","Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Gesture recognition;Image sequences;Training;User interfaces;Machine learning","feature extraction;gesture recognition;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pose estimation;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;traffic engineering computing;video signal processing","real-time hand posture user interface;gesture-based touchless automotive user interface;deep learning;vision based in-car entertainment user interface;hand posture recognition algorithm;hand gesture recognition algorithm;recurrent convolutional neural network;image sequence;video sequence;sparse dictionary learning;frame extraction;nonlinear regression framework;multilayer perceptron;optimal neural network architecture","","1","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our method does not require any human interaction and bridges the gap between classical offline and target-less online calibration approaches as it provides both a stable initial estimation as well as a continuous online correction of the extrinsic parameters. During training we randomly decalibrate our system in order to train RegNet to infer the correspondence between projected depth measurements and RGB image and finally regress the extrinsic calibration.

A fast variational dense 3D reconstruction algorithm was developed which robustly integrates data terms from multiple images. This mitigates the effect of the aperture problem and is demonstrated on synthetic and real data. An additional property of the variational reconstruction framework is the ability to integrate sparse depth priors (e.g. from RGB-D sensors or LiDAR data) into the early stages of the visual depth reconstruction, leading to an implicit sensor fusion scheme for a variable number of heterogenous depth sensors. Embedded into a keyframe-based SLAM framework, this results in a memory efficient representation of the scene and therefore (in combination with loop-closure detection and pose tracking via direct image alignment) enables us to densely reconstruct large scenes in real-time. Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset shows that our method can recover large-scale and dense reconstructions of entire street scenes in real-time from a driving car.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995899","","Image reconstruction;Cameras;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Visualization;Real-time systems;Three-dimensional displays;Cost function","image fusion;image reconstruction;image representation;pose estimation;SLAM (robots);stereo image processing;variational techniques","large-scale visual SLAM;commodity notebook;fast variational dense 3D reconstruction algorithm;data term integration;multiple images;aperture problem;synthetic data;sparse depth prior integration;visual depth reconstruction;implicit sensor fusion;heterogenous depth sensors;keyframe-based SLAM;memory efficient representation;loop-closure detection;pose tracking;direct image alignment;KITTI dataset;large-scale reconstructions;dense reconstructions;street scenes;driving car;real-time variational stereo reconstruction","","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, we build our analysis upon two questions: where and what the driver is looking at? Second, we model the driver's gaze by training a coarse-to-fine convolutional network on short sequences extracted from the DR(eye)VE dataset. Experimental comparison against different baselines reveal that the driver's gaze can indeed be learnt to some extent, despite (i) being highly subjective and (ii) having only one driver's gaze available for each sequence due to the irreproducibility of the scene.

In the case of infrequent objects, such as traffic signs, hand labeling many hours of road scene video becomes impractical. In this paper, we propose an iterative Search & Learn method capable of quickly creating object detection datasets numbering in the 10's of thousands of real-world examples within days, using only a few hours of human labelling. The approach can be initiated using a few hundred hand labeled objects or a single exemplar. This is used to create a “search-detector” with sufficient precision to find a larger collection of real-world examples from a large video library. These examples can then be used to train an improved search-detector. A similar approach can be simultaneously applied to traffic sign classification, where a preliminary classifier can be used to minimize human sorting in the creation of very large classification datasets. Results are shown on 3 traffic sign detection and classification tasks; speed-limit (10 subclasses), minimum-speed (3 subclasses), and no-entry. The resulting datasets contain over 200K, 100K, and 80K real-world examples respectively in 3-5 iterations of the method. Classification accuracy rapidly improves with the number of real-world examples and generally approaches 99% accuracy once the number of objects surpasses 100K images.","","978-1-5090-4804-5978-1-5090-4803-8978-1-5090-4805","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995906","","Detectors;Training;Labeling;Training data;Robustness;Libraries;Neural networks","neural nets;object detection;object recognition;traffic engineering computing","iterative search & learn;large datasets;object recognition;neural networks;traffic signs;hand labeling;road scene video;object detection datasets;human labelling;hand labeled objects;search detector;video library;traffic sign classification;traffic sign detection","","","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, with the rise of deep neural networks and their success in ADAS systems, it is natural to investigate the suitability of CNN for road marking recognition. Unlike others, our focus is solely on road marking recognition and not detection; which has been extensively explored and conventionally based on MSER feature extraction of the IPM images. We train five different CNN architectures with variable number of convolution/max-pooling and fully connected layers, and different resolution of road mark patches. We use a publicly available road marking data set and incorporate data augmentation to enhance the size of this data set which is required for training deep nets.

So far many researchers have investigated systems combining a high density LIDAR with cameras or stereo, which results in an expensive and complex setup where the LIDAR data is mostly used to extract regions of interest for the 2D sensor. Very few work has focused on using pure 3D data coming from the LIDAR to recognize pedestrians, and even less have made an intensive use of the intensity information returned by the LIDAR. The intensity information displays a high frequency change between neighboring points of similar material, this can be due to the angle or distance. Due to this, it has not been frequently investigated as a potentially interesting feature as it would require extensive time consuming feature engineering to be worthwhile. In this paper we present a novel 2D representation of a 3D point cloud including the intensity information. We show the ability of convolutional neural networks to handle this data in order to accurately recognize pedestrians in complex driving scenes.

Unlike prior next-frame prediction approaches, we take advantage of the scene geometry and use the predicted depth for generating the next frame prediction. Our approach can produce rich next frame predictions which include depth information attached to each pixel. Another novel aspect of our approach is that it predicts depth from a sequence of images (e.g. in a video), rather than from a single still image. We evaluate the proposed approach on the KITTI dataset, a standard dataset for benchmarking tasks relevant to autonomous driving.
