Recent developments in vehicle onboard computers and wireless communications devices, also known as dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) devices allow the exchange of information between vehicles (inter-vehicle communications). In an application of vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication, the most important issue is to handle delay which has a negative impact on safety issue since communication networks generally introduce delays. To cope with this problem, the inter-vehicle communication system is firstly modelled by reflecting signal characteristic.

Unlike the Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Torque-Vectoring influences the vehicle dynamics not only through braking forces but also by setting up positive driving torques allowing for a new way of dynamic driving. In this paper two different control algorithms are developed in order to calculate a desired yaw moment to influence vehicle dynamics.

Previous algorithms that use Time-to-Collision (TTC) as a measure of threat tend to assume constant state and constant input; e.g. constant yaw rate and constant acceleration. Although the predictability of these algorithms is acceptable within a one second time horizon, it becomes invalid for predictions over one second because yaw rate and acceleration are highly unlikely to be constant. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a threat prediction algorithm that can accurately predict TTC over a longer time horizon based on future trajectory predictions of a surrounding vehicle. First, a comprehensive set of local path candidates is generated along the curvilinear coordinates using a quintic (5<sup>th</sup> order) polynomial with respect to the arc-length corresponding to the different lateral offsets. Trajectory prediction of a surrounding vehicle is accomplished by introducing target lane detection, which is estimated according to the amount of difference between the current motion and the centerline of the driving lane. Based on these future vehicle trajectories, TTC is computed by comparing the entrance and exit time of two vehicles into and out of the conflict area where the occupied spaces of two vehicles overlap. Finally, in order to provide threat assessment results, the inverse TTC values obtained above are plotted on a 2-dimensional trajectory plane where each set of the tangential acceleration and the initial yaw acceleration values represents each local path candidate. Thus, these threat assessment results can be directly utilized to determine a driving strategy of autonomous vehicles.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225849","","Vehicles;Trajectory;Acceleration;Polynomials;Prediction algorithms;Roads;Reliability","polynomials;road traffic control;road vehicles;trajectory control","threat prediction algorithm;local path candidates;vehicle trajectory predictions;automated driving vehicles;driver assistance systems;time-to-collision measure;TTC measure;time horizon;yaw rate;curvilinear coordinates;quintic polynomial;trajectory prediction;target lane detection;2-dimensional trajectory plane;tangential acceleration;yaw acceleration;vehicle driving strategy","","7","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From being perceived as a comfort feature, autonomous features in vehicles have now become a safety feature which are foreseen to reduce accidents. This has led to a new trend within the automotive industry of focussing on autonomous features for driver safety, which might ultimately lead to fully autonomous vehicles. Considering the fact that most of the accidents on UK roads occur due to driver error, driver-less vehicles would prove to be a benefit. However with automation, an even greater challenge of system validation in all scenarios needs to be addressed. For this, various methods of validation have been developed by different research organizations and manufacturers, but a standardized process still evades the industry. Some of the existing methods have been discussed in this paper to critically compare their quality of results and ease of execution. Subsequently, a new test platform has been proposed using the 3xD driving simulator which encompasses most requirements of a general testing method. A standardized process which would benefit the industry both in terms of reducing costs of having varied processes, and by increasing customer confidence can be developed using a non-invasive platform like the 3xD driving simulator.

Stabilization is then entrusted to the vehicle's built-in production systems, such as electronic stability control, which constantly augment driving inputs to ensure stability. Other approaches explicitly consider stabilization criteria and implement permanently active constraints on the vehicle's actions. Situations exist, however, where enforcing stability constraints could lead to an otherwise avoidable collision. This paper presents an alternative paradigm for autonomous vehicle control that explicitly considers vehicle stability and environmental boundaries as it attempts to track a trajectory; such a mediator can choose to violate short term stability constraints in order to avoid a collision. Model predictive control provides an implementation framework, and an autonomous vehicle demonstrates the viability of the controller as it performs aggressive maneuvers. Driving around a turn at the vehicle's limits exhibits the importance of vehicle stability for autonomous vehicle control. Performing an emergency double lane change, however, highlights a situation where stability criteria must be temporarily violated to avoid a collision.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225836","","Vehicles;Stability criteria;Tires;Trajectory;Mobile robots;Roads","collision avoidance;mobile robots;predictive control;road vehicles;stability;telerobotics;trajectory control","collision avoidance;vehicle stabilization;autonomous vehicle control;trajectory tracking;model predictive control","","6","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, when there is vehicle parked on the roadside, we need to detect its position and pass it safely with proper distance without causing much disruption during driving. In this paper, we propose a method to detect roadside parked vehicles robustly and design a trajectory with proper lateral offset from the lane center for the host vehicle to safely pass by it. To successfully detect the roadside parked vehicles, we fuse the output from a long range lidar and radar. We pre-compute multiple path candidates with different lateral offset, and the path planner selects the most proper one based on the distance of the parked vehicle to the lane center. To deal with false alarms and missing detections, we apply temporal filtering to the detection output and history of the decision making.

Anticipation enhances the driving intelligence and strengthens the vehicle's ability in taking advance action, e.g., lane change, speed adjustment, in a dynamically varying traffic environment. More elaborately, presuming a connected vehicle environment, the system receives the information form the surrounding vehicles and infrastructure instantly through V2X communication systems and, using dynamical models, predicts the future road-traffic states.

However, the direct measurement of this variable is difficult due to its spatial nature and the only method to directly measure it from field is aerial photography. Hence, it is usually estimated from other easily measurable variables such as speed or flow. Some of the reported approaches to obtain density include the input output analysis, fundamental traffic flow relation, and occupancy-based measurements in addition to those based on statistics, machine learning or model-based approaches. However, for better performance, all these methods require the careful selection of the relevant input variables/parameters and their relationships. One way of obtaining these relationships is to perform a dimensional analysis of the variables/parameters involved, identifying the non-dimensional variables/parameters and then obtaining a relationship between them using experimental data. This approach has been attempted for estimating road traffic density in this paper. The appropriate non-dimensional variables/parameters that characterize road traffic flow were first determined and the relation between them was then found out using simulated data. This relationship was subsequently used to estimate density for other datasets and the results were found to be promising.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225814","","Vehicles;Correlation;Mathematical model;Roads;Estimation;Computational modeling;Analytical models","estimation theory;road traffic;simulation","traffic density estimation;dimensional analysis;road congestion;input-output analysis;traffic flow relation;occupancy-based measurement;data simulation","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On different roads such as urban roads and expressways, the observed information of surrounding is significantly different. For example, on the urban roads, many buildings can be observed around the upper part of the vehicle. Such observation realizes accurate map matching. On the other hand, the upper part has no specific observation on the expressway. Therefore, it is necessary to observe the lower part for the map matching. To adapt the situation changes, we propose a localization method based on self-adaptive multi-layered scan matching and road line segment matching.

Traffic speeds of following road segments are first predicted by Neural Networks (NNs) based on historical traffic data. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are trained by the Baum-Welch algorithm with historical traffic and vehicle data to present the statistical relationship between vehicle speed and traffic speed. The forward-backward algorithm is applied on HMMs to extract vehicle's speed on each road segment along the driving route.

The first stage deals with an adaptive-window-based turn-rate estimation for tracking maneuvering targets. The estimator can detect abrupt changes in turnrates and function independently, and avoids the problem of non-linear vehicle dynamics, thereby facilitating the use of standard Kalman filter. Variable-structure models with updated estimated turn-rate are utilized in the second stage to perform data association followed by IMM-based velocity estimation. The proposed algorithm results in root-mean-squared error of position and velocity to 5-6 cm and 0.25-0.3 m/s, respectively, and the turn-rate converges up to 10% accuracy within 3-4 s.

The reference path is refined and interpolated via a nonlinear optimization algorithm and a parametric algorithm, respectively. Secondly, the trajectory planning task is decomposed into spatial path planning and velocity profile planning. A closed-form algorithm is employed to generate a rich set of kinematically-feasible spatial path candidates within the curvilinear coordinate framework. At the same time, the velocity planning algorithm is performed with considering safety and smoothness constraints. The trajectory candidates are evaluated by a carefully developed objective function. Subsequently, the best collision-free and dynamically-feasible trajectory is selected and executed by the trajectory tracking controller. We implemented the proposed trajectory planning strategy on our test autonomous vehicle in the realistic urban traffic scenarios.

The effect of using a collision avoidance system on a Volvo A25 hauler is investigated in several simulated scenarios with stationary obstacles. It is concluded that the safety benefit is severely limited by the relatively low braking capacity of the machine. Due to the limited capacity, braking manoeuvres must be initiated rather early, therefore steering is more efficient in many situations. Moreover, collisions are difficult to avoid when there is an offset between the machine and obstacle which is likely to occur in unstructured environments. The effect of different driving styles is also analysed and adapting the collision avoidance function to the individual driver can increase the number of collisions prevented. Another possible way to increase the safety benefit is to introduce a safety margin around obstacles.

Crowd based mapping approaches using low cost sensors appear more practicable. Herein we propose a general method to align several trajectories of the same area which is fundamental for any life-long mapping. Our algorithm requires previously acquired pose differences as input. These differences induce a pose graph which is aligned yielding a minimum least-squares residual. Therefore, our method is independent from the underlying sensor technology. For evaluation purposes, we align pose graphs from simulated pose differences and compare it against the ground truth. Furthermore, stereo cameras are used to obtain pose difference estimates by common visual odometry methods.

This paper presents a method to predict the maneuvers performed by vehicles at arbitrary all-way stop intersections, using noisy sensor data. This is required for an autonomous vehicle to decide when to enter the intersection, or for a driver assistance system to decide when to issue a collision warning to the driver. The problem is divided into two components. The first component estimates the maneuver intention of the drivers by means of a naïve Bayesian filter. The second component predicts the order in which the vehicles will enter the intersection by means of a kinematic feedback model. Both algorithms are evaluated using real world data collected with laser sensors mounted on a vehicle. The Bayesian filter is successfully applied to intersections of different sizes and geometries.

So we propose a lane map-based localization using a 2D Laser Rangefinder. The maps are created beforehand using a 2D LiDAR and RTK GPS. A pose estimation of vehicle was derived from a low-cost GPS and an iterative closest point(ICP) match of real-time sensor data to lane map. And the estimated pose was used as an observation inside a Kalman filter framework. The performance of the proposed localization algorithm is verified via vehicle tests in ITS proving ground. It has been shown through vehicle tests that good localization performance can be obtained.

In particular, the driving corridor of the host vehicle is generated by fusing multiple sources of data and the leader vehicle is determined, if available, to provide the real-time and validated information, such as trajectory and velocity, for the control purposes of the host vehicle. The potential applications of such information range from extending the functionality of the existing ADAS systems, e.g., vision-based platooning, stop-and-go traffic jam assist, etc., to autonomous driving in terms of high-level decision making and path planning.

One of the most well-known methods to measure a driver's concentration is called driver state monitoring, where the driver is warned when he or she is falling asleep based on visual information of the face. On the other hand, autonomous driving systems have garnered attention in recent years as an alternative plan to reduce human-caused accidents. This system shows the possibility of realizing a vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals. However, lack of technical maturity, human acceptance problems, and individual desire to drive highlight the demand to keep human drivers in the loop. For these reasons, it is necessary to decide who will be responsible for driving the vehicle and adjusting the vehicle control system. This is known as the driving control authority. In this paper, we present a system that can suggest transitions in various driving control authority modes by sensing a decline of the human driver's performance caused by drowsiness or inattentiveness. In more detail, we identify the problems of the legacy driving control authority transition made only with vision-based driver state recognition. To address the shortcomings of this method, we propose a new recommendation method that combines the vision-based driver state recognition results and path suggestion of an autonomous system. Experiment results of simulated drowsy and inattentive drivers on an actual autonomous vehicle prototype show that our method has better transition accuracy with fewer false-positive errors compared with the legacy transition method that only uses vision-based driver state recognition.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225717","","Vehicles;Monitoring;Mobile robots;Accidents;Prototypes;Roads;Wheels","cooperative systems;driver information systems;mobile robots;road accidents;robot vision;vehicles","cooperative autonomous vehicle;car accidents;driver state monitoring;human-caused accidents;human acceptance problems;legacy driving control authority transition;vision-based driver state recognition","","3","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Achieving this goal has the advantage of preventing some tires from reaching saturation before other tires do. This algorithm for optimal tire force allocation can be combined with trajectory tracking near the limits of handling to follow the desired speed, heading, and lateral position of a vehicle.

In this study, we propose Sampling-based Collision Warning System (SCWS) that overcomes the limitations of existing collision warning systems such as high installation cost, requirement of high market penetration rate, and the lack of consideration of traffic dynamics. SCWS gathers vehicle operation data though smartphones of drivers on the road and shares the information of surrounding vehicles' movement through a cloud server. From the pool of information on the cloud, SCWS uses sampled data, which indirectly represents the traffic state and traffic changes in the perspective of the leader vehicle. Therefore, SCWS can effectively replace the leader vehicle's information with the average behavior of sampled surrounding vehicles. The performance of SCWS is evaluated with comparison to Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication based Collision Warning System (VCWS) and Infrastructure based Collision Warning System (ICWS), where VCWS is considered the most similar measure to the actual collision risk in theory, but in practice very difficult to achieve due many limitations, such as high installation cost and market penetration. The result shows that in both aggregation and disaggregation level analysis the proposed SCWS exhibits a similar collision risk trend to the VCWS. Furthermore, the SCWS shows a high potential for practical application because it has the acceptable performance even with a low sampling ratio (40%), requiring a low market penetration rate and low installation cost by using the wide spread smartphone.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225843","","Vehicles;Alarm systems;Roads;Smart phones;Acceleration;Servers;Sensors","cloud computing;collision avoidance;road safety;road traffic;sampling methods;smart phones;vehicle dynamics","sampling-based collision warning system;smartphone;cloud computing environment;road safety;collision-warning system;SCWS;installation cost;market penetration rate;traffic dynamics;vehicle operation data;vehicle movement;cloud server;traffic state;traffic change;vehicle-to-vehicle communication based collision warning system;VCWS;infrastructure based collision warning system;ICWS;collision risk;disaggregation level analysis;sampling ratio","","1","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These features are matched in consecutive images using moment invariants. Together with an estimation of the ego motion, a 3D reconstruction of corresponding landmarks is obtained by applying multiple view geometry. For the unsupervised mapping process, landmarks are tracked and their corresponding global coordinates are stored in a geospatial database using a high-precision real-time kinematic system. The localization process itself is based on a particle filter to estimate the pose of the vehicle by making use of the previously generated map and currently observed landmarks.

In dense traffic lane-changes and merging are often key ingredients to cause safety hazards, traffic breakdowns and travel delays. In this paper, we propose an efficient cooperative lane-changing algorithm CLA for sensor- and communication-enabled automated vehicles to reduce the lane-changing bottlenecks. For discretionary lane-changing, we consider the advantages of the subject vehicle, the follower in the current lane and k (an integer) lag vehicles in the target lane to maximize speed gains. Our algorithm simultaneously minimizes the impact of lane-change on traffic flow and the overall trip time, fuel-consumption and pollutant-emission. For mandatory lane-changing CLA dissociates the decision-making point from the actual mandatory lane-changing point and computes a suitable lane-changing slot in order to minimize lane-changing (merging) time. Our algorithm outperforms the potential cooperative lane-changing algorithm MOBIL proposed by Kesting et al. [1] in terms of merging time and rate, waiting time, fuel consumption, average velocity and flow (especially at the point in front of the merging point) at the cost of slightly increased average trip time for the mainroad vehicles compared to MOBIL. We also highlight important directions for further research.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225900","","Vehicles;Merging;Computational modeling;Acceleration;Fuels;Safety;Roads","air pollution control;decision making;hazards;road safety;road traffic;sensors;transportation;vehicular ad hoc networks","cooperative lane-changing algorithm;communication-enabled automated vehicles;sensor-enabled automated vehicles;transportation system;road traffic;trip time minimization;fuel consumption;pollutant-emission;safety hazards;traffic breakdowns;travel delays;CLA;traffic flow;decision-making point;MOBIL;VANET","","4","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Trips are then split into elementary units corresponding to an homogeneous driving context. For each trip element, the optimal energy consumption strategy is computed via (expensive) dynamic programming simulations. Here, data analysis is used so as to identify descriptors of this trip element that are relevant to predict the energy consumption. Then, a polynomial model is fit to the data so as to estimate, for each new trip element, the optimal energy consumption strategy from the expected driving condition, rather than using dynamic programming. Our approach distinguishes itself by the fact that road context, driver style, road slope and auxiliary electrical power are taken into account to estimate the energy consumption of a PHEV. The accuracy of the prediction process is evaluated over test data, and demonstrates the interest of our approach in predicting energy consumption.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225775","PHEV;energy consumption;learning;route preview;prediction;dynamic programming","Roads;FCC;Fuels;Energy consumption;Vehicles;Polynomials;Batteries","dynamic programming;energy consumption;Global Positioning System;hybrid electric vehicles;polynomials","plug-in hybrid electric vehicle;PHEV;trip recordings;trip elements;GPS navigation system;elementary units;homogeneous driving context;optimal energy consumption strategy;expensive dynamic programming simulations;data analysis;polynomial model;driving condition;road context;driver style;road slope;auxiliary electrical power;prediction process accuracy;on-board navigation data","","2","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional approaches have utilized GPS data, pre-built map information, and lane detection results to estimate the lateral location of an ego-vehicle. However, these approaches demonstrate several performance limitations due to inaccurate data from GPS, high costs for building and maintaining maps, and insufficient visual cues for handling various tasks in diverse driving environments. In this paper, we propose an accurate ego-lane recognition framework that utilizes multiple evidence from visual processing upon the theory of the Bayesian Network to overcome these limitation. We show that more accurate and reliable lateral localization results can be achieved by combining several visual cues, which increases confidence and reliability of the results. We also show that our approach can be applicable to various driving environments without maps because the framework analyzes multiple context information of driving environments simultaneously.

In order to develop trustworthy assistance systems, this paper starts from classifying driver's uncertainty about distance gaps and studies the impact of distance gaps on driver's uncertainty at lane changing. In the driving simulator experiment, participants were asked to take steering or brake actions in different lane change situations. Their reaction times to an acoustic signal ordering to start changing lanes and subjective certainty scores were collected and analyzed. The results showed that with the constant closing speed of 10 km/h between the ego vehicle and rear vehicle, the brake action was more often preferred than the steering and participants were relatively certain with short reaction times at small distance gaps (&lt;; 32m). At large distance gaps (&gt; 44m), the steering was more often chosen than brake actions and participants were also certain with short reaction times. However, when the distance gap was in between (32m, 36m, 40m, 44m), participants were very uncertain and had relatively long reaction times.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225858","","Uncertainty;Vehicles;Acoustics;Mirrors;Intelligent vehicles;Atmospheric measurements","behavioural sciences computing;driver information systems;road safety","driver uncertainty classification;distance gap;trustworthy assistance system;lane change situation;driver reaction time;driver wrong decisions;critical driving task;driver uncertainty reduction;traffic safety;driver trust;driving simulator experiment;steering action;brake action;acoustic signal ordering;ego vehicle;rear vehicle","","6","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, vehicle motion planning in inner city environment requires the detection of road terrain up to 3 seconds in advance. State-of-the-art visual road terrain detection systems have a hard time fulfilling this task, due to their limited range and the presence of occlusions (other vehicles, buildings, etc.), which are expected to occur often in complex scenarios. However, those systems provide significant information where the conditions are favorable (proximity to the ego-vehicle, no occlusions). Therefore, a complementary approach is needed to enhance already existing and established detection systems. In this paper we propose a probabilistic grid-based approach based on the observation and interpretation of other vehicles' behavior in the scene. It exploits their movements in order to infer the presence and location of occluded road surface. We will show that this approach presents various advantages over current visual road terrain detection systems, especially in those situations that are the most challenging for them. We will illustrate how our approach is designed to work in concert also with other available resources, e.g. offline road maps. Qualitative results on real-world scenes taken from the KITTI benchmark[11] demonstrate that the fusion of this method with visual road terrain detection can potentially extend our time horizon well over the 3 seconds mentioned above.

These data are used to produce a database of 640 synthetic images of wet and dry road scene, under different conditions (weather, date, direction).

Nevertheless, it lacks a series of properties that would be desirable for more realistic agent models. In this paper, as an alternative and improvement to the IDM, we propose the Foresighted Driver Model (FDM), which assumes that a driver acts in a way that balances predictive risk (e.g. due to possible collisions along its route) with utility (e.g. the time required to travel, smoothness of ride, etc.). Based on a risk concept developed for full behavior planning, we introduce driver model equations from the assumption that a driver will mainly try to avoid risk maxima in time and space. We show how such a model can be used to simulate driving behavior similar to full behavior planning models and which generalizes and reaches beyond the IDM modeling scenarios.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225706","","Vehicles;Predictive models;Frequency division multiplexing;Trajectory;Adaptation models;Acceleration;Roads","intelligent transportation systems;road traffic;simulation","foresighted driver model;FDM;intelligent driver model;IDM;microscopic time continuous car following model;freeway traffic simulation;urban traffic simulation;single vehicle velocity profiles;collective traffic behavior;driver model equations;driving behavior;full behavior planning models","","15","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main concerns in risk assessment can be summarized as three requirements: 1) a description of a traffic situation containing the geometric description of the road, dynamic and static obstacle tracking, 2) a prediction of multiple traffics' reachable set under the reasonable behavior restriction, and 3) an assessment of collision risk which corresponds with driver sensitivity and can be applied to many complex situations without loss of generality. To fulfill these three requirements, the proposed algorithm for estimating the probability of collision occurrence of the ego vehicle follows the basic idea of the particle filtering and the collision probability can be numerically implemented and calculated. The overall performance of the proposed threat assessment algorithm is verified via vehicle tests in real road. It has been shown that the threat assessment performance for the given driving situations can be significantly enhanced by the proposed algorithm.

However, this approach exhibits large amounts of control effort, and ignores other criteria such as smoothness or the importance of staying on plan at different times. Conversely, our proposed approach leverages the concept of potential fields to represent a driving corridor with a desired tracking error tolerance and direct torque-based steering control to smoothly steer the vehicle with a much smaller control effort. Further, using potential fields allows us to naturally incorporate obstacles in the driving corridor to circumvent them, with typically no need for explicit trajectory planning. We compare our approach to a standard steering controller in experiments with a real-world autonomous vehicle platform. Results show that our proposed approach achieves similar path tracking performance as a high-gain SWA controller, but with much less actuator effort.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225703","","Vehicles;Torque;Planning;Trajectory;Mobile robots;Wheels;Roads","mobile robots;motion control;path planning;road vehicles;steering systems;torque control;trajectory control","potential field;torque-based steering actuation;autonomous driving;integrated motion planning and control;autonomous car navigation;autonomous vehicle navigation;steering controller;steering wheel angle;control effort;tracking error tolerance;direct torque-based steering control;trajectory planning;real-world autonomous vehicle platform;path tracking performance;high-gain SWA controller","","5","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method considers the orientation of a vehicle in the space exploration phase to achieve knowledge about driving directions. Such information is exploited later in the heuristic search phase to improve the planning efficiency in maneuvering scenarios. This approach is not bound to the specific domain knowledge about a parking or maneuvering task, but obtains the space dimension and orientation information through a generic exploration procedure.

This paper presents a detailed analysis of why a TOR can occur, how the automated driving system should react during the TOR phase and what should happen at the end of a TOR in order to realize a safe and comfortable TOR for the driver.

To assist such drivers, a driver model which can recommend the appropriate speed by learning driving data of expert drivers based on a statistical approach is useful for a driver assistance system. The proposed method automatically estimates parameters of the driver model from the actual driving data by defining risk potential functions for representing braking behaviors while passing through intersections, oncoming vehicles and pedestrians.

I-ADAS may use side-looking sensors, e.g. radar and lidar, in order to detect potential collisions with vehicles from crossing paths. The success of I-ADAS depends on the range and azimuth capabilities of these sensors. In order to specify the capabilities of sensors for an I-ADAS, designers need a distribution of range and azimuth between vehicles as they enter intersections prior to crashes. This study generated range and azimuth distributions using crash data from the National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey (NMVCCS) for vehicles just prior to entering the intersection in straight crossing paths (SCP) crashes. Using the reconstructions and specifications in existing radar technology, the potential crash mitigation benefits of this technology were determined. Three radar-based I-ADAS were analyzed using published sensor specifications. The sensors included a wide beam, intermediate beam, and narrow beam. The wide beam I-ADAS was found to detect 20.3% of oncoming vehicles, the intermediate beam was found to detect 89.2% of oncoming vehicles, and the narrow beam was found to detect 98.3% of oncoming vehicles. The results indicate that a narrow beam I-ADAS is the most capable because of its long range detection ability.

Many ideas have been proposed to reduce this problem, among of this ideas is moving in platoon. The constant time headway policy (CTH) is a very important platoon control policy, but it is too conservative and induces large inter-vehicle distances. Recently, we have proposed a modification of CTH [1], [2]. This modification reduces inter-vehicle distances and makes CTH very practical. This paper focuses on the control of platoons in urban areas. To control the vehicles, we assume that the longitudinal and the lateral dynamics are decoupled. We take into account a simplified engine model. We linearize the two dynamics using exact linearisation technique. Then, we use the modified CTH control law, adapted to urban platoons, for the longitudinal control and the robust sliding mode control for lateral control. The stability and the safety of the platoon are also studied. The conditions of stability of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous platoons are established. The conditions to verify the safety of the platoon for the longitudinal control (assuming stable and accurate lateral control) are exhibited. The weaknesses (large inter-vehicle distance, weak stability near low frequencies) of the CTH are solved. The improved performance and the safety of the platoon are verified by simulation using TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator). A platoon consisting of ten vehicles is created and tested on a curved track, keeping a small desired intervehicle distance. The stability and safety of the longitudinal and lateral controls are tested in many scenarios. These scenarios include platoon creation, changing the speed and emergency stop on straight and curved tracks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225714","","Vehicles;Stability analysis;Safety;Vehicle dynamics;Acceleration;Engines;Biological system modeling","engines;position control;road safety;road traffic control;robust control;variable structure systems","urban platooning;flatbed tow truck model;traffic congestion;constant time headway policy;platoon control policy;intervehicle distance reduction;vehicle control;longitudinal dynamics;lateral dynamics;simplified engine model;linearisation technique;CTH control law;urban platoons;longitudinal control;robust sliding mode control;lateral control;platoon safety;nonhomogeneous platoon stability;TORCS;The Open Racing Car Simulator","","1","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it suffers from poor performance in diverse environment due to the fact that the single reward function could not handle all the environment with large diversity. Towards this issue, a novel IRL framework with multiple reward functions to deal with environmental diversity is proposed in the paper. Specifically, the model employs Dirichlet process mixtures as a flexible and powerful Bayesian model to divide the environment into clusters and learns the parameters in each cluster simultaneously. Experimental result with expert driver behavior data shows that our model with multiple reward functions provides superior performance over the IRL model with single reward function. It also suggests that the clustering of environments based on the driving behavior of professional drivers could be useful on evaluating driving environments.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225745","","Vehicles;Roads;Data models;Acceleration;Magnetohydrodynamics;Predictive models;Safety","Bayes methods;behavioural sciences;driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);road accidents;road safety","driving behavior prediction;multiple reward functions;environmental diversity;defensive driving;advanced driver assistance systems;driving behavior modeling;residential roads;inverse reinforcement learning;intelligent vehicle community;Dirichlet process mixtures;Bayesian model;IRL model;environments clustering;professional drivers;driving environments","","10","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We assume that the measured sensor information is generated from several hidden time-series data through multiple nonlinear transformations. These hidden time-series data are statistically independent of each other and capture essential driving behavior. Driving behavior information is usually generated by multiple nonlinear transformations that fuse essential features, e.g., ""Yaw rate"" is generated by fusing the velocity of the vehicle and the change of driving direction. However, driving behavior data is often redundant because such data includes multivariate information and involves duplicated essential features. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction method to extract essential features from redundant driving behavior data using a deep sparse autoencoder (DSAE), which is a deep learning method. Two-dimensional features are extracted from seven-dimensional artificial data using a DSAE and are determined experimentally to be highly correlated with the prepared essential features. DSAEs are also used to extract features from an actual driving behavior data set. To verify a DSAE's ability to extract essential driving behavior features and filter out redundant information, we prepare twelve data sets that include some or all of the driving behavior information. Twelve DSAEs are used to independently extract features from the twelve prepared data sets, and canonical correlation analysis is used to analyze the canonical correlation coefficients between extracted features. Furthermore, we verify DSAEs' ability to extract essential driving behavior features from the redundant driving behavior data sets.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225824","","Frequency modulation;Correlation;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Erbium;Data mining;Intelligent vehicles","behavioural sciences computing;driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);time series","deep-learning method;sensor information;control area network;hidden time-series data;multiple nonlinear transformations;statistical analysis;yaw rate;vehicle velocity fusion;driving direction;multivariate information;duplicated essential-feature extraction;deep-sparse autoencoder;DSAE;two-dimensional feature extraction;seven-dimensional artificial data;canonical correlation coefficient analysis;redundant driving behavior data sets","","7","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We tested three transition time conditions, with an unstructured transition of vehicle control occurring 2 seconds, 5 seconds, or 8 seconds before the participants encountered a road hazard that required the drivers' intervention. Few drivers in the 2 second condition were able to safely negotiate the road hazard situation, while the majority of drivers in 5 or 8 second conditions were able to navigate the hazard safely. Similarly, drivers in 2 second condition rated the vehicle to be less likeable than drivers in 5 and 8 second conditions.

To do this, they need to check constantly if their own vehicle's occupancy collides with the other traffic participants' occupancy. Those collision checks consume a substantial amount of time and consequently, the collision avoidance systems could fail to intervene in complex scenarios. We propose a new approach to reduce the computation time for collision checks significantly. Instead of using geometric methods, we store finitely many possible collision scenarios between two objects in a table and thus collision checks become a matter of lookup table queries. To ensure that the finite number of configurations cover all possible scenarios, we use a novel abstraction technique which guarantees that every collision will be detected. The approach works for arbitrarily many traffic participants by applying the approach pairwise (own vehicle and other object) to each traffic participant. Randomly generated scenarios show that the new approach can be several times faster than geometric intersection techniques thanks to the trade-off between memory consumption and computation time.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225842","","Collision avoidance;Vehicles;Quantization (signal);Uncertainty;Robot sensing systems;Memory management;Prediction algorithms","collision avoidance;computational complexity;road traffic control;road vehicles;table lookup","time-memory trade-off;collision detection;collision avoidance system;traffic participant occupancy;computation time;geometric method;collision scenario;lookup table query;abstraction technique;geometric intersection technique;memory consumption","","3","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We conducted a driving simulator study to investigate the concept of geometrical transformation of the steering wheel to address both issues. Therefore, we implemented a prototype steering wheel which changes its shape depending on the current driving mode to improve mode awareness and comfort when driving highly automated. The study was focused on possible negative effects of the mechanical transformation in front of the driver during the take-over process. Results indicate that on average participants reacted faster and took over control later.

While some of the recorded road incidents in these studies have their roots in distracting events (such as mobile phone usage) a large proportion of recorded road incidents can be attributed to more elusive driver inattention factors not linked to specific trigger events. These distraction categories are especially challenging and currently not in focus of current research as they are difficult to detect and address by suitable prognostic measures, in order to improve road safety. To contribute to this issue, this paper presents research into monitoring drivers' mental states in real-time, using objective measurements. We propose an iterative research methodology where specific mental states are elicited, user response captured experimentally, and interaction models built using advanced machine learning techniques.

This driver-centric approach addresses the complex issue of driver inattention, and can help improve road safety through active monitoring of road users, customized decision support in the vehicle, and objective training feedback.

Previous approaches to traffic light detection on autonomous vehicles have involved either precise knowledge of the relative 3D positions of the vehicle and the traffic light (requiring accurate and expensive mapping and localisation systems), or a classifier-based approach that searches for traffic lights in images (increasing the chance of false detections by searching all possible locations for traffic lights). We combine both approaches by explicitly incorporating both prior map and localisation uncertainty into a classifier-based object detection framework, generating a scale-space search region that only evaluates parts of the image likely to contain traffic lights, and weighting object detection scores by both the classifier score and the 3D occurrence prior distribution. We present results comparing a range of low- and high-cost localisation systems using over 30 km of data collected on an autonomous vehicle platform, demonstrating up to a 40% improvement in detection precision over no prior information and 15% improvement on unweighted detection scores. We demonstrate a 10x reduction in computation time compared to a naïve whole-image classification approach by considering only locations and scales in the image within a confidence bound of the predicted traffic light location. In addition to improvements in detection accuracy, our approach reduces computation time and enables the use of lower cost localisation sensors for reliable and cost-effective object detection.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225746","","Uncertainty;Three-dimensional displays;Cameras;Vehicles;Object detection;Global Positioning System;Transforms","image classification;object detection;statistical distributions;traffic engineering computing","3D semantic scene priors;online traffic light interpretation;probabilistic framework;online object detection performance;traffic light detection;autonomous vehicles;classifier-based object detection framework;scale-space search region;object detection scores;classifier score;3D occurrence prior distribution;whole-image classification approach;confidence bound","","14","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The parameters of the transformation are found by the optimization of a suitable join metric.

With an increasing number of vehicles, the communication channel must not get congested especially if a large amount of information has to be transmitted over multiple hops to a destination. This challenge can be solved by reducing the data load through data aggregation. In this paper, we present a decentralized congestion control using the channel busy ratio (CBR) on the application layer for an adaptive control of aggregation levels in real time. Adaptive decision algorithms decide which data is aggregated in real time. Two different approaches are compared: One approach relies on two CBR thresholds (min/max) only and one that allows a higher number of CBR thresholds. In both cases, the adaptive aggregation control increases and decreases the data aggregation levels based on these thresholds. Our simulation results show that both approaches are able to adjust the aggregation levels to given channel load thresholds within seconds resulting in improved data quality even in heavy congested situations. Adaptive decision algorithms result in less error introduced by aggregation.

Steer-by-wire technology enables active steering capability in which the driver's command to the roadwheels is augmented for maintaining safety. Predictive controllers can leverage both of these technologies to create shared control safety systems that work with the driver to ensure a safe and collision-free vehicle trajectory. The earlier the system intervenes, the smoother the intervention but the more it interferes with the driver's control authority. Ideally, predictive controllers should still intervene late but also indicate upcoming environmental threats to the driver as early as possible. Haptic feedback provides a good means of communicating information to the driver early. Together with a controller still providing a late intervention fallback, this regime provides an ideal framework for predictive shared control systems. This paper presents a novel technique for creating haptic steering feedback, based on future differences between the predictive controller and the driver. This feedback mirrors the tension between the sometimes competing controller objectives of following the driver and maintaining a feasible path.

A grid map divides the environment into cells and estimates the occupancy probability of each cell based on sensor measurements. An important extension is the Bayesian occupancy filter (BOF), which additionally estimates the dynamic state of grid cells and allows modeling changing environments. In recent years, the BOF attracted more and more attention, especially sequential Monte Carlo implementations (SMC-BOF), requiring less computational costs. An advantage compared to classical object tracking approaches is the object-free representation of arbitrarily shaped obstacles and free-space areas. Unfortunately, publications about BOF based on laser measurements report that grid cells representing big, contiguous, stationary obstacles are often mistaken as moving with the velocity of the ego vehicle (ghost movements). This paper presents a method to fuse laser and radar measurement data with the SMC-BOF. It shows that the doppler information of radar measurements significantly improves the dynamic estimation of the grid map, reduces ghost movements, and in general leads to a faster convergence of the dynamic estimation.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225827","","Vehicle dynamics;Estimation;Probability density function;Vehicles;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Approximation methods","Bayes methods;Doppler radar;filtering theory;Monte Carlo methods;object tracking;optical radar;radar signal processing;sensor fusion;signal representation","radar sensor data fusion;laser fusion;sequential Monte Carlo Bayesian occupancy filter;occupancy grid mapping;environment perception approach;sensor measurement;SMC-BOF;object tracking approach;object-free representation;radar measurements doppler information;grid map dynamic estimation;ghost movement reduction","","23","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We explore the pedestrian detection purely based on motion, which is common and intrinsic for all pedestrians regardless of their shape, color, background, etc. We found unique motion characteristics of humans different from rigid objects in motion profiles. Based on the explicit analysis of spatial-temporal behaviors of pedestrians, non-smooth motion points are detected at the motion trajectories of limbs and body. This method works for driving video where both pedestrians and background are moving, and it yields good results as it is less influenced from pedestrian variations in shape and environment.

Second, dense motion stereo is performed using IPI. Next, depth information is calculated and mapped onto the grid map. Lastly, a fusion of the grid maps is executed to enhance the quality of the map using a modified temporal median filter. The method can efficiently collect height and position information about objects relative to the road surface. The reason is that wide-angle images are converted to IPI to remove the perspective distortion of the road surface, and the depth is calculated using dense motion stereo from IPI. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed fusion method is significantly higher than that of previous methods. The proposed method is very simple, but the quality that could be obtained is similar to the quality produced by the conventional technique, and the building speed showed dramatically fast performance of up to 200 fps in a single core CPU.

With the ongoing evolution of ADAS towards Automated Driving, the amount of cameras installed in a vehicle is expected to increase. At the same time, the performance of such cameras needs to match more stringent requirements. Nowadays automotive cameras are typically sensitive beyond the visual range (i.e. into the near infrared range). They may also use up to 20 bits precision for their internal signal. In order to support the development process of ADAS and Automated Driving Systems by means of simulation, it is required to have detailed physically correct simulation models of these automotive cameras. This paper describes the need for physics-based simulation and introduces a new spectral HDR camera model in the ADAS simulation platform PreScan. The traditional RGB-based camera implementation created images limited to the visual spectrum. In contrast, the new PreScan spectral camera model allows for high color depth, broad spectrum and physically correct image generation. The model provides a real-time simulation of light in the 320-1500nm spectral range which traverses through the various media and lenses before the sensor produces the final image signal.

Though we used ISO's definitions for the timings, our participants felt that status updates on the display came too late.

On the other hand, we observed that participants liked a continuous encoding of the time-to-collision (TTC) and observed a decrease in missed opportunities to overtake. Therefore, we argue that the defined limits for the warning levels are not well suited to support drivers during decision making in our scenario. Our contribution lies in a novel way of supporting drivers during lane change using an ambient in-vehicle light display. We showed that a continuous light pattern might help drivers in decision making, while more research has to be done to validate this.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225735","","Vehicles;Color;Safety;Brightness;Conferences;ISO Standards;Atmospheric measurements","computer displays;traffic engineering computing","ambient light patterns;lane change decision support;ambient light displays;driver comfort;lane change maneuver;lane change decision aid systems;LCDAS;ISO 17387 standard;time-to-collision;TTC encoding","","1","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The prediction of the current traffic scene into the future is one of the main problems in this context. In this publication we focus on highway scenarios, where the maneuver space for traffic participants is limited to a small number of possible behavior classes. Even though there are many publications in the field of maneuver prediction, most of them set the focus on the classification problem, whether a certain maneuver is executed or not. We extend approaches which solve the classification problem of lane-change behavior by introducing the novel aspect of estimating a continuous distribution of possible trajectories. Our novel approach uses the probabilities which are assigned by a Random Decision Forest to each of the maneuvers lane following, lane change left and lane change right. Using measured data of a vehicle and the knowledge of the typical lateral movement of vehicles over time taken from realworlddata, we derive a Gaussian Mixture Regression method. For the final result we combine the predicted probability density functions of the regression method and the computed maneuver probabilities using a Mixture of Experts approach. In a large scale experiment on real world data collected on multiple test drives we trained and validated our prediction model and show the gained high prediction accuracy of the proposed method.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225907","","Vehicles;Trajectory;Probabilistic logic;Prediction algorithms;Training;Context;Vegetation","Gaussian processes;mixture models;pattern classification;probability;regression analysis;road traffic","probabilistic regression approach;traffic situations;dynamic traffic environments;autonomous driving;traffic scene prediction;highway scenarios;maneuver prediction;classification problem;lane-change behavior;random decision forest;maneuvers lane following;Gaussian mixture regression method;probability density functions;maneuver probabilities;mixture of experts approach","","19","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces a novel machine learning-based sign recognition scheme. In the proposed scheme, detection and classification are realized through learning in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on the observation that signs in the same category share some common attributes in appearance, the proposed scheme first distinguishes each individual sign category from the background in the coarse learning stage (i.e. sign detection) followed by distinguishing different sign classes within each category in the fine learning stage (i.e. sign classification). Both stages are realized through machine learning techniques. A complete recognition scheme is developed that is effective for simultaneously recognizing multiple categories of traffic signs. In addition, a novel saliency-based feature extraction method is proposed for sign classification. The method segments salient sign regions by leveraging the geodesic energy propagation. Compared with the conventional feature extraction, our method provides more reliable feature extraction from salient sign regions. The proposed scheme is tested and validated on two categories of Chinese traffic signs from Tencent street view. Evaluations on the test dataset show reasonably good performance, with an average of 97.5% true positive and 0.3% false positive on two categories of traffic signs.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225725","Traffic sign detection and classification;Chinese traffic signs;street view images;salient feature extraction;coarse-to-fine classification","Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Shape;Detectors;Training;Support vector machines","feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","traffic sign recognition;salient region features;learning-based coarse-to-fine scheme;sign detection;sign classification;advanced driver assistance systems;autonomous vehicles;machine learning-based sign recognition scheme;sign category;sign classes;learning stage;saliency-based feature extraction;salient sign regions segmentation;geodesic energy propagation;Chinese traffic signs;Tencent street view","","2","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A detailed analysis of the data obtained from loop detectors revealed that there were errors in the data. Two model based schemes, namely the occupancy based method and the queue clearance based method, were used for estimation of queue and delay using the erroneous data obtained from loop detectors.

Interestingly, effectiveness does not reduce with data delays from 0s up to 180s, indicating that for the presented case, congestion is predicted with sufficient accuracy. However, estimation errors in speed and flow increase, and accuracy of advices (including false negatives and positives) decreases.

However, direct estimation of such kind of information from stream data is difficult. To address the issue, we apply an unsupervised symbolization method and topic representation to driving data. Driving stream data is converted to sequences of discrete symbols by a non-parametric symbolization method, and then the symbols are characterized by topics which represent typical distribution of driving behavior observed during the symbols. Because these symbols are separated on changing points of driving behavior, similar driving situations are effectively retrieved from sequences of the symbols. For evaluating effectiveness of the symbolization approach, we extract lane change situations based on the topic proportions and their temporal patterns. Distinctive elements of topic proportions and their temporal patterns for lane change situations are extracted by AdaBoost classifier. As a result, proposed approach outperforms baselines with neither topic proportions nor their temporal patterns in terms of extracting lane change situations.

However, research on this simple stereo estimation technique has been very scarce since the advent of energy-based methods which promise a higher quality and a larger potential for further improvement. In the domain of intelligent vehicles, especially semi-global-matching (SGM) is widely spread due to its good performance and simple implementation. Unfortunately, the big downside of SGM is its large memory footprint because it is working on the full disparity space image. In contrast to this, local block-matching stereo is much more lean. In this paper, we will introduce a novel multi-block-matching scheme which tremendously improves the result of standard block-matching stereo while preserving the low memory-footprint and the low computational complexity. We tested our new multi-block-matching scheme on the KITTI stereo benchmark as well as on the new Middlebury stereo benchmark.

In order to develop a detector that successfully operates under these conditions, it becomes critical to leverage upon multiple cues, multiple imaging modalities and a strong multi-view classifier that accounts for different pedestrian views and poses. In this paper we provide an extensive evaluation that gives insight into how each of these aspects (multi-cue, multi-modality and strong multi-view classifier) affect performance both individually and when integrated together. In the multi-modality component we explore the fusion of RGB and depth maps obtained by high-definition LIDAR, a type of modality that is only recently starting to receive attention. As our analysis reveals, although all the aforementioned aspects significantly help in improving the performance, the fusion of visible spectrum and depth information allows to boost the accuracy by a much larger margin. The resulting detector not only ranks among the top best performers in the challenging KITTI benchmark, but it is built upon very simple blocks that are easy to implement and computationally efficient.

We assume each depth-unknown pixel's depth value derives from all depth-known pixels and their affinity can be measured in a geodesic manner. Specifically, for each depth-unknown point, we compute its geodesic distance to all depth-known points, the cost of each geodesic path is calculated by spatial distance, color aberrance and tensor discrepancy, which compacts with the assumption that color homogenous region corresponds to close or smooth depth value, while depth discontinuity often happens in image edges. To mitigate computation complexity, we further introduced a flexible approximation algorithm in which the complexity is linear to image's size and can be further reduced w.r.t. different accuracy requirement. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on both KITTI visual benchmark suite and Middlebury dataset.

We hypothesise that this is due to stereo visual odometry being an inherently easier problem, rather than than due to higher quality of the state of the art stereo based algorithms. Under this hypothesis, techniques developed for monocular visual odometry systems would be, in general, more refined and robust since they have to deal with an intrinsically more difficult problem.

To overcome this limitation, Cost Aggregation Table (CAT) was proposed which uses two-dimensional cost aggregation so as to utilize whole image information. In this paper, we propose improved global 2D cost aggregation methods by loosening aggregation constraints. It aggregates every cost in the whole image to estimate each disparity.

The ToF working principle assumes the scene to be motionless during this time interval. However and in practise, unreliable depth measurements arise along object boundaries in dynamic scenes, mainly when fast movements are involved. Herein, we propose a robust method to identify those pixels in the resulting depth map that are prominent to be unreliable.

While some recent work attempts to address this issue by only computing a subset of unary potentials, a need remains for a simple, fast way to decide which unary potentials should be computed, without sacrificing accuracy. In particular, for embedded applications, a method which avoids time or memory-intensive operations is desired. In this paper, we introduce an approach to selecting good locations to compute unary potentials. We implement an efficient morphological approach to select a small proportion of pixel locations where unary potentials will be calculated. The speed of our labelling method allows us to directly search a large parameter space to optimize our method for a given task. We show that our method can achieve comparable accuracy to what can be achieved when all unary potentials are calculated, with significant time saving. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to tune our method to yield improved accuracy for certain classes of interest.

This paper proposes a method enhancing the accuracy of u-disparity-based free space boundary estimation to the subpixel level. The conventional method detects peak series by exploiting dynamic programming in u-disparity made by accumulating disparity maps depending on the u coordinate. It assumes that the bigger accumulation value of the u-disparity of a position and the smaller vertical coordinate change between the position and its previous column, the higher is the possibility that the position belongs to peak series. However, as the conventional method considers only vertical coordinate change with respect to the previous column, it has a problem that even a straight line will be penalized if it is not seen to be horizontal. To address this problem, this paper proposes preview dynamic programming, which is modified to consider the slope change with the previous and next column. Additionally, to solve the problem that a slope smaller than 45 cannot be represented by integer coordinates, this paper proposes modified u-disparity, which uses average coordinates weighted by u-disparity values within a fixed size window. Through qualitative evaluations with an open dataset, it is confirmed that the proposed method significantly mitigates the quantization noise of free space boundary estimated by the conventional method.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225726","","Indexes;Estimation;Roads;Quantization (signal);Noise;Dynamic programming;Automotive engineering","automotive engineering;dynamic programming;object detection;stereo image processing","stereo vision;subpixel level free space boundary detection;modified u-disparity;preview dynamic programming;road surface;automotive field","","1","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The original grid quantization-based NDT results in good registration performances but has poor convergence properties due to discontinuities of the optimization function and absolute grid resolution.

In this paper, we present two methods based on the belief theory that can be used to improve the data association reliability. After that we propose as an example of tracking implementation and discuss the effect of using a multi-criteria track-to-target association algorithm.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225728","","Target tracking;Radar tracking;Sensors;Observers;Indexes;Kalman filters","inference mechanisms;reliability;sensor fusion;target tracking;uncertainty handling","multicriteria tracking;Dempster-Shafer theory;belief theory;tracking systems;track-to-target association problem;data association reliability;multicriteria track-to-target association algorithm","","1","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Unsupervised image transformation for outdoor semantic labelling","G. Ros; J. M. Alvarez","Computer Vision Center, Campus UAB, 08193, Bellaterra, Spain; NICTA, Canberra Research Laboratory, Canberra, Australia","2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","","2015","","","537","542","Semantic labelling of urban images is a crucial component towards autonomous driving. The accuracy of current methods is highly dependent on the training set being used and drops drastically when the distribution in the test image does not match the expected distribution of the training set. This situation will inevitably occur, as for instance, when the illumination changes from daytime to dusk. To address this problem we propose a fast unsupervised image transformation approach following a global color transfer strategy. Our proposal generalizes classical one-to-one color transfer schemes to the more suitable one-to-many scheme. In addition, our approach can naturally deal with the temporal consistency of video streams to perform a coherent transformation. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposal in two publicly available datasets using different state-of-the-art semantic labelling frameworks.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225740","","Image color analysis;Semantics;Labeling;Dictionaries;Training;Streaming media;Visualization","image colour analysis;lighting;traffic engineering computing;video streaming","outdoor semantic labelling;urban images;autonomous driving;test image;illumination;fast unsupervised image transformation approach;global color transfer strategy;one-to-one color transfer schemes;one-to-many scheme;temporal video stream consistency","","5","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While some of the recorded road incidents in these studies have their roots in distracting events (such as mobile phone usage) a large proportion of recorded road incidents can be attributed to more elusive driver inattention factors not linked to specific trigger events. These distraction categories are especially challenging and currently not in focus of current research as they are difficult to detect and address by suitable prognostic measures, in order to improve road safety. To contribute to this issue, this paper presents research into monitoring drivers' mental states in real-time, using objective measurements. We propose an iterative research methodology where specific mental states are elicited, user response captured experimentally, and interaction models built using advanced machine learning techniques. Behavioral measures such as speech, eye activity or posture, and physiological measures such as galvanic skin response or heart rate provide input features for the models. This driver-centric approach addresses the complex issue of driver inattention, and can help improve road safety through active monitoring of road users, customized decision support in the vehicle, and objective training feedback. Low-fidelity simulators we have built allowed us to roll out some preliminary tasks prompting encouraging feedback from subjects during informal testing.","","978-1-4799-0795-3978-1-4799-0794","10.1109/IVWorkshops.2013.6615218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615218","","Vehicles;Monitoring;Roads;Safety;Data models;Real-time systems;Hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;road safety;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","informal testing;low-fidelity simulators;objective training feedback;customized decision support;driver-centric approach;galvanic skin response;physiological measures;posture;eye activity;speech;advanced machine learning techniques;interaction models;real-time;road safety;prognostic measures;distraction categories;elusive driver inattention factors;mobile phone usage;road incidents;road traffic injuries;driver distraction;human-centric analysis","","1","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast to approaches that rely on calibration, we propose a learning approach that will create an implicit calibration model from training data. Our model can provide three functions: first of all, it can convert a measurement in one sensor into the coordinate system of the other, or into a distribution of probable measurements in case the transformation is not unique. Secondly, using a correspondence observation that we define, the model is able to decide if two visual/LIDAR measurements are likely to come from the same object. This is of profound importance for applications such as object detection or tracking where contributions from several sensors need to be combined. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by training and evaluating our system on tracklets in the KITTI database as well as on a small set of real-world scenes containing pedestrians, in which our method finds correspondences between the results of real visual and LIDAR-based detection algorithms.","1931-0587","978-1-4673-7266-4978-1-4673-7265","10.1109/IVS.2015.7225825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225825","","Laser radar;Visualization;Training;Calibration;Databases;Data models;Three-dimensional displays","calibration;computer vision;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;object tracking;optical radar;pedestrians","calibration-free match finding;learning approach;visual measurement;LIDAR measurement;coordinate system;correspondence observation;object detection;object tracking;pedestrian","","1","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system offers early scenario-specific information together with automated support in steering and braking. The solved challenges and gathered experiences will ease and accelerate the development of future functions for piloted inner-city driving. In this sense, the function is an important evolutionary step towards highly automated driving in urban areas. The ADAS was realized in the context of the publicly-funded project UR:BAN, which started in 2012. In October 2015 the project UR:BAN reached its peak in a public presentation in Düsseldorf Germany. Numerous driving demonstrations allowed guests an independent evaluation on a larger scale. The Bosch NRA performed in all situations reliably surpassing the expectations of many guests. The focus of the contribution will be on the detailed description of the system and its evaluation.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535541","UR:BAN;automated steering;automated braking;inner-city assistance;grid-based environment model","Vehicles;Roads;Cameras;Urban areas;Vehicle dynamics;Context;Safety","braking;driver information systems;road safety;steering systems;video signal processing","advanced driver assistance systems;Bosch NRA;UR:BAN project;publicly-funded project;inner-city driving;automated braking support;automated steering support;scenario-specific information;narrow road passage safety;inner-city ADAS;highly automated driving;narrow road assistant","","1","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
