The switched operation between human driver and autopilot system is carried out when the hazard situation is tested by the autopilot controller. The driver's operation and the deviation from the road center line are employed to carry out the hazard evaluation. The autopilot controller is designed using the constrained model predictive control (MPC) approach to keep the intelligent vehicle run in the safe area that is between the road boundary.

Realistically, different driving conditions require vast different level of cognitive ability, e.g., driving in highly congested traffic is much more challenging than driving on limited access highway; driving in a blizzard/hurricane requires much more robust environmental cognition abilities than driving under ordinary conditions. Different datasets contain different proportions of various driving conditions, rendering intelligent vehicle evaluation susceptible to dataset variations. To overcome such limitations, we propose to first benchmark the driving difficulty with the proposed “Cascaded Tanks Model” and obtain a fine-grained per-segment difficulty rating based on our proposed Semantic Descriptor.

Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop appropriate security protocols facilitating V2I and V2V communication.

An experimental study has been conducted to investigate the key features of the ACC controller using Global Navigation Satellite System data. The first remarks based on the data focus on the controller's reaction time and desired time gap. Both parameters are essential in order to assess the influence of these technologies to safety and traffic flow. It is a common assumption that autonomous vehicles will have negligible reaction time and desired time gap comparable to that of a human driver. This paper presents an experimental study of an ACC-enabled vehicle on car following mode and a methodology for the estimation of the controller's reaction time that can be used as benchmark in other scenarios. The results show the reaction time to be around l.ls and the time gap to be distinctly larger than that of a human driver.

Platooning makes multiple vehicles travel as closely as possible to get the maximum driving efficiency. The problem here is that the view of the rear vehicle driver may be blocked by the front vehicle. In order to improve rear driver's safety and psychological stability, video streaming among vehicles aims to provide the front view of the platoon leader to rear vehicle drivers. In this paper, we first focus on measurement of realtime video streaming performance using IEEE 802.11p broadcast in the platoon. As a result, packet delivery ratio dropped to 48% in the worst case that the collision and hidden terminal problem coexist. To mitigate the frame loss, we use pseudo-broadcast that can recover frames by retransmission instead of broadcast. In addition, we employ Request-To-Send/Clear-To-Send whose transmission power increased by 5 dB to solve the hidden terminal problem. Consequently, we can prevent the frame loss and increase the packet delivery ratio up to 96.8%. Our proposal enables vehicle-to-vehicle communications to exploit a new method integrating characteristics of unicast and broadcast to solve this problem. Besides, our proposal can easily apply to existing devices by updating a device driver without any hardware chip level modification.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500514","","Streaming media;Unicast;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Safety;Hardware;IEEE 802.11 Standard","broadcast communication;vehicular ad hoc networks;video streaming;wireless LAN","rear vehicle driver;platoon leader;vehicle drivers;packet delivery ratio;hidden terminal problem;frame loss;vehicle-to-vehicle communications;vehicle-to-vehicle realtime video streaming;multiple vehicles;Platoons;IEEE 802.11p broadcast","","1","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experiments performed on a Hardware-in-Loop (HiL) setup were used to evaluate the effect of Iatency for various scenarios.

Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is used to learn motion patterns from historical trajectory data collected with static sensors on the road. Trained models are then shared among the vehicles through connected vehicle cloud. A vehicle receives information, such as Global Positioning System coordinates, about nearby vehicles on the road using inter-vehicular communication. The collected data from vehicles together with GPR models received from infrastructure are then used to predict the future trajectories of vehicles in the scene.

Modern vehicles support multiple systems for localization, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), lidar, and video feed. However, the problem of merging data from different sources for reducing errors remains challenging. This problem becomes increasingly hard if we use data with high uncertainty - for example, crowdsourced environmental features. Such data can provide invaluable information, especially when other data sources, such as GPS, are not available. Unfortunately, using it for vehicle localization requires great care, as crowdsourced data can be very noisy and imprecise. In this paper we present a Bayesian approach for sensor fusion, and use it to improve vehicle localization using crowdsourced data of traffic sign positions. We show that this method offers noticeable improvements (error reduction by 8.2%) compared to using GNSS and IMU only, and is comparable to the use of precise traffic signs positions - which are superior to crowdsourced positions, but very hard to obtain at scale.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500404","","Global navigation satellite system;Trajectory;Global Positioning System;Bayes methods;Time measurement;Position measurement;Satellites","Bayes methods;intelligent transportation systems;satellite navigation;sensor fusion","crowdsourced data;vehicle localization;intelligent transportation systems;sensor fusion;ITS;Bayesian framework","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quantifying the uncertainties of the sensors used in the vehicle is essential for utilizing effective fusion systems. Since the identification of the true values of the uncertainties is an exhaustive task, this paper introduces an online adaptive covariance estimation approach for drift suffering proprioceptive sensors, using an exteroceptive sensor with known uncertainty.

In this paper, a game theoretical approach is proposed to model the interaction of vehicles while considering the surrounding traffic situations. One of the novel move is that a neural network is applied to establish the payoff function in the game which is able to describe the interaction more precisely.

Based on Kalman filter theory, three observers have been developed: a kinematic model based attitude observer for pitch angle and roll angle using IMU, a kinematic model based lateral velocity observer for lateral velocity using IMU and a dynamic model based observer using vehicle dynamics. In small excitation condition, the estimated lateral velocity from dynamic model based observer is more reliable and it is forwarded to the two kinematic model based observers to prevent the accumulated estimation error.

The management plan takes three steps to erase the traffic blockage caused by those abreast slow drivers, including detection of abreast slow drivers, appraisal of environmental factors, and traffic guidance notification for all relevant drivers. In the proposed plan, the detection model initially evaluates the whole street and picks out all the abreast low speed vehicles based on the i-Vics. For every blockage target, a appraisal model of the surroundings determines the strategy how to dissolve the traffic blockage, including the feasibility of overtaking, and possibility of passing through the intersection and etc. Finaly, once the dissolving strategy is approved by the appraisal program, the management system sends notification of speed guidance to all relevant drivers to guide them to pass through the signalized intersection within the remaining green time.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500380","","Roads;Appraisal;Automobiles;Safety;Space vehicles;Environmental factors","cooperative systems;intelligent transportation systems;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles","traffic blockage;abreast slow drivers;traffic guidance notification;abreast low speed vehicles;blockage target;management system;speed guidance;signalized intersection;slow vehicles;city road;intelligent vehicular infrastructure cooperative systems;on-road traffic management plan;abreast low speed connected vehicles;on-road i-vics management","","","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wu","College of Engineering in Shanghai Normal University, TianHua College, Shanghai, PRC","2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","","2018","","","1968","1975","In order to properly control slip-to-slip shift process of electric vehicles (EVs) equipped with dry dual-clutch transmissions (DDCT), dynamic modelling of a dry-type two-speed dual-clutch transmission for an electric vehicle in torque phase is proposed at first. Then, an optimal control strategy is proposed to investigate feasibility of non-shock shift process of torque phase without power interruption and power circulation. Optimal solutions of electric motor torque and dual clutch friction torques are derived in analytical form. And then, a dynamic model of fork-lever actuator is integrated into DDCT driveline dynamic model of EV, and an affine nonlinear shift dynamic model for the whole DDCT system is proposed to describe dynamic behaviours in torque phases of shift. Further, to solve problems in tracking inaccuracy induced by strong nonlinearities and modelling uncertainties ofthe dynamic model, sliding mode control strategy based on feedback linearization control theory is proposed. Accurate electric motor torque as well as motor currents imposed to affine nonlinear system are calculated through nonlinear feedback control law. Finally, tracking control accuracy of the affine nonlinear dynamic system is investigated through numerical simulation on MATLAB/Simulink platform. The simulation results verify that not only non-shock shift process of torque phase without power interruption and power circulation is realized, but also torque phase time can be adjusted to an arbitrary value based on actual requirement. Besides, high-precision tracings to optimal angular velocities of electric motor and dual clutch are realized by accurately modulating motor control currents and electric motor torque.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500573","Electric vehicle;dry-type dual clutch transmission;fork-lever actuator driven by ball screw-roller assembly;optimal control;feedback linearization control;sliding mode control","Intelligent vehicles","clutches;control nonlinearities;electric motors;electric vehicles;feedback;linearisation techniques;nonlinear dynamical systems;optimal control;power transmission (mechanical);road vehicles;uncertain systems;variable structure systems","dual-clutch transmission;electric vehicle;optimal control strategy;nonshock shift process;dual clutch friction torques;DDCT driveline dynamic model;affine nonlinear shift dynamic model;feedback linearization control theory;nonlinear feedback control law;affine nonlinear dynamic system;torque phase time;motor control currents;dry-type two-speed dual clutch transmission;optimal power transmission process;slip-to-slip shift process;dynamic modelling;sliding mode control strategy;electric motor torque","","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motion planning for safe stop differs from nominal motion planning, since there is not a specific goal location. Rather, the desired behavior is that the vehicle should reach a stopped state, preferably outside of active lanes. Also, the functionality to stop safely needs to be of high integrity. The first contribution of this paper is to formulate the safe stop problem as a benchmark optimal control problem, which can be solved by dynamic programming. However, this solution method cannot be used in real-time. The second contribution is to develop a real-time safe stop trajectory planning algorithm, based on selection from a precomputed set of trajectories. By exploiting the particular properties of the safe stop problem, the cardinality of the set is decreased, making the algorithm computationally efficient.

In some of these, for example near highway ramp-entrances, they adjust intuitively their own behavior in order to facilitate the merging of the incoming vehicles. On highly automated vehicles, this decision should be taken by the system. In such situations, not only the own goal should be optimized but also the comfort of the surrounding traffic. The ability to plan adequate courtesy behaviors improves public acceptance of autonomous systems and the comfort of the surrounding vehicles without considerably decreasing the own comfort. We present a novel method that automatically adapts the driving behavior, integrating the merging intention of other vehicles. In contrast to other systems, robustness is achieved by considering not only the most likely evolution, but also the expected value of the possible outcomes in real time. The flexibility of this method allows us to integrate it within different planning systems. We are therefore able to offer courtesy behaviors to other vehicles, thereby improving the collective comfort and also safety of the situation.

For anglicizing the lateral dynamics problem, the bike vehicle model is introduced firstly. Since saturation and non-linear phenomenon may happen on tires during the time when the vehicle is steering, parameters like cornering stiffness would change during that procedure and hence there're parameter uncertainties in the system. Moreover, the modelling uncertainties and disturbance also exist. Robust control is applied for dealing the problem above. A H<sub>∞</sub>controller is designed to guarantee performance of the handling stability. Pole placement method is used for the consideration of the transient response.

In this paper, we propose a physical model based on incompressible fluid dynamics to represent the vehicle's motion, which provides hints of possible collision as a continuous scalar riskmap. We estimate the position and velocity of other vehicles from a monocular on-board camera located in front of the ego-vehicle. The noisy trajectories are then modeled as the boundary conditions in the simulation of advection and diffusion process.

In this computational paradigm, the cloud serves as the (relatively) stable repository of reference knowledge that is less frequently accessed than in non-swarm computation. The “vehicle swarm on the other hand, serves as a (relatively) dynamic cache of knowledge at the “edge.” Leveraging the collaborative swarm mode reduces real-time deadline pressures at the individual node level, while improving edge resilience through redundancy.

Since physical test drives are costly and time consuming, it is advantageous to accompany them with computer simulations. However, since most traffic scenarios are not challenging, even simulations are often too time consuming. To address this issue, we present an approach that creates automatically critical driving situations, i.e., situations with a small solution space for avoiding a collision. Our approach combines reachability analysis for determining the size of the solution space with optimization techniques to shrink it. The solution space is reduced by shifting the initial states of traffic participants, demanding an immediate and correct action of the vehicle under test. We demonstrate our approach by automatically increasing the criticality of several initially uncritical situations recorded from real traffic.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500374","","Optimization;Testing;Trajectory;Space vehicles;Planning;Autonomous vehicles;Computational modeling","collision avoidance;optimisation;reachability analysis;road safety;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","autonomous vehicles;physical test drives;time consuming;computer simulations;traffic scenarios;driving situations;solution space;correct action;criticality;automatic generation;safety-critical test scenarios;collision avoidance;road vehicles;correct functionality;uncritical situations","","","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A two-stage strategy is proposed for generating online solutions: at Stage 1, the CAVs are requested to reach a standard formation before entering the intersection; at Stage 2, the vehicles cross the intersection. As the motion planning sub-problem at Stage 2 begins with a standard configuration, the optimal solution to this standard sub-problem can be computed offline in advance and applied online directly.

The TTR describes the last point in time along the current trajectory at which an evasive trajectory exists. In this paper, we present a novel approach to determine the point in time after which it is guaranteed that no evasive maneuver exists, i.e., by using reachable sets, we over-approximate the TTR. Our deterministic upper bound of the TTR can be used to trigger a collision mitigation system or to find a feasible emergency maneuver which avoids the collision.

Our trajectory planning algorithm is structured such that the spatial and temporal planning is integrated so that both the longitudinal and lateral aspects, reflected in the shape and length of the planned trajectory, are dynamically changing to best negotiate the constraints from road curvature and surrounding vehicles. The concept of a vehicle connected to shadow trolleys traveling along the rails on the road is introduced. Given waypoints, a reference cubic spline can be constructed to define the rail for trolleys and form a curvilinear coordinate. This concept facilitates the description of vehicle motion, trajectories, and surroundings with respect to the trolley, which is especially convenient for a vehicle traveling on high curvature road and switchbacks. A temporal optimization of the trolley instances is first conducted, which in turn allows us to make a proper approximation and reduce an originally complex nonlinear spatial-temporal optimization problem into one that requires only Quadratic Programming (QP). We present simulation results of various challenging scenarios on complex road geometry with multiple surrounding vehicles of varying behavior to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show reasonable, flexible, and safe maneuvers.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500498","","Trajectory;Planning;Roads;Splines (mathematics);Optimization;Autonomous vehicles;Geometry","collision avoidance;geometry;mobile robots;motion control;optimisation;path planning;predictive control;quadratic programming;road vehicles;splines (mathematics);trolleys","complex road geometry;shadow trolleys;autonomous vehicle;switchbacks;automated driving;road geometry information;stored maps;Model Predictive Control trajectory planning algorithm;spatial planning;embedded temporal optimization;waypoints information;temporal planning;longitudinal aspects;lateral aspects;planned trajectory;road curvature;reference cubic spline;vehicle motion;trolley instances;complex nonlinear spatial-temporal optimization problem;bending roads;Quadratic Programming","","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When an ego-vehicle crosses an intersection, predicting the trajectory of oncoming other vehicles is a requirement for Advanced Driver Assistant Systems. In this paper, we propose a method of trajectory prediction of turning vehicles at urban intersections. Trajectory prediction of turn maneuver vehicles is more difficult than straight-maneuver vehicle because a turning vehicle slows down as it approaches the intersections and speeds up as it leaves the intersections. Furthermore, the variation in velocities depends on factors such as an intersection angle, a corner radius. Our method generates a novel desired velocity model for trajectory prediction that takes into account intersection geometry and observed velocities of other vehicles. Specifically, we assume that the velocity becomes minimum at around the crosswalk, and calculate the velocity model by fitting past sequential velocities and estimated minimum velocity to the cubic function. Our method has the advantage of being able to predict the trajectory at any intersection and from any position. The prediction performance of our method in the real traffic scenarios is better than one of other methods.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500472","","Trajectory;Turning;Hidden Markov models;Predictive models;Velocity control;Geometry;Acceleration","control engineering computing;driver information systems;road accidents;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;trajectory control","trajectory prediction;observed velocities;urban intersections;dynamic traffic situations;ego-vehicle crosses;turn maneuver vehicles;straight-maneuver vehicle;turning vehicle;intersection angle;novel desired velocity model;account intersection geometry;sequential velocities;minimum velocity;prediction performance;Advanced Driver Assistant Systems;cubic function","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Clustering point measurements with the same properties into multiple homogeneous regions is a challenging task due to an uneven sampling density and lack of explicit structural information. This paper presents a novel technique to achieve a robust and fast point-cloud segmentation using the characteristic intrinsic sensor pattern. This pattern is characterized by the mounting position of each laser diode. A structured mesh graph is created by taking the beam calibration and the chronology of incoming data packets into account. The proposed graph-based, multi-pass point segmentation algorithm compares this pattern with a flat-world model to detect discontinuities and to set label attributes such as obstacle or free space for each vertex. Furthermore, we directly detect missing measurements and therefore generate artificial vertices considering the laser beam intrinsics. Finally, a region-growing algorithm is applied in order to obtain cohesive objects.

However, there is usually no prior knowledge of the number of tracking targets due to object emergence, object disappearance and false alarms. To overcome this challenge, we propose a generic vehicle tracking framework based on modified mixture particle filter, which can make the number of tracking targets adaptive to real-time observations and track all the vehicles within sensor range simultaneously in a uniform architecture without explicit data association. Each object corresponds to a mixture component whose distribution is non-parametric and approximated by particle hypotheses. Most tracking approaches employ vehicle kinematic models as the prediction model. However, it is hard for these models to make proper predictions when sensor measurements are lost or become low quality due to partial or complete occlusions. Moreover, these models are incapable of forecasting sudden maneuvers. To address these problems, we propose to incorporate learning-based behavioral models instead of pure vehicle kinematic models to realize prediction in the prior update of recursive Bayesian state estimation. Two typical driving scenarios including lane keeping and lane change are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed framework as well as the advantages of employing learning-based models.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500626","","Target tracking;Predictive models;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;State estimation;Vehicle dynamics","Bayes methods;Kalman filters;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;object tracking;particle filtering (numerical methods);road vehicles;robot kinematics;sensor fusion;state estimation;target tracking","mixture particle filter;targets tracking;data association;vehicle kinematic models;generic vehicle tracking framework;occlusions handling;sensor measurements;learning-based behavioral models;Bayesian state estimation;behavioral models;complete occlusions;partial occlusions;prediction model;particle hypotheses;false alarms;object disappearance;object emergence;prior knowledge;autonomous driving;road participants;robust tracking","","3","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The majority of current researches fix the number of driving intentions by considering only a specific scenario. However, distinct driving environments usually contain various possible driving maneuvers. Therefore, a intention prediction method that can adapt to different traffic scenarios is needed. To further improve the overall vehicle prediction performance, motion information is usually incorporated with classified intentions. As suggested in some literature, the methods that directly predict possible goal locations can achieve better performance for long-term motion prediction than other approaches due to their automatic incorporation of environment constraints. Moreover, by obtaining the temporal information of the predicted destinations, the optimal trajectories for predicted vehicles as well as the desirable path for ego autonomous vehicle could be easily generated. In this paper, we propose a Semantic based Intention and Motion Prediction (SIMP) method, which can be adapted to any driving scenarios by using semantic defined vehicle behaviors.

This is a two-step motion-planning method including path-planning and motion timing steps, where both steps are sampling-based. In the path-planning part, an improved RRT method is defined that increases the smoothness of the path and decreases the computational time of the RRT method; it is called smooth RRT, SRRT. While some other RRT-based methods such as RRT can perform better in winding roads, in the problem of interest in this paper (which is performing some regular traffic maneuvers in usual urban roads and highways where the passage is not too winding), SRRT is more efficient since the computational time is less than for the other considered methods. In the motion timing or velocity-tuning step (VTS), a sampling-based method is introduced that guarantees collision avoidance between different vehicles. The proposed motion-timing algorithm can be very useful for collision avoidance and can be used with any other path-planning method.

This idea allows a single platooning control law to handle complex scenarios such as intersection and roundabout crossings. This work combines the use of high definition maps and a curvilinear coordinates framework to deal with any kind of roundabouts.

These drawbacks have a negative impact when used in real systems. In this paper we address both drawbacks by integrating a steering method into a state-of-the-art lattice-based motion planner. Un- like previous approaches, in which path optimization happens in an a posteriori step after the planner has found a solution, we propose an interleaved execution of path planning and path optimization.

However, large numbers of road scenes, especially the up and down slope road environment, cannot meet this requirement.In this paper, we propose a multiple vanishing point detection method to reconstruct the road space in slope scenes. In order to improve the accuracy of vanishing point estimation, the road images are decomposed into near and far regions. We extract candidate lane markers in near region by using multiscale convolution kernel and Hough Transform at first. Then, the lane markers in far region can be detected based on the result of near region. At last, different vanishing points are extracted in near and far regions.

This becomes critical when it comes to conflicting driving situation such as lane merge, tollgate area, and unsignalized intersections. Previously developed future prediction algorithms show limited performance when handling interactions and conflicts between vehicles because they focused on predicting individual vehicle motion and/or interaction between a single pair of vehicles rather than the entire traffic scene. In this paper, a scene representation method, namely multi-channel Occupancy Grid Map (OGM), is proposed to describe the entire traffic scene, which is then utilized for the deep learning architecture that predicts the future traffic scene or OGM. Multi-channel OGM represents entire traffic scene as a manner of image-like structure from bird's eye view composed with dynamic layer and static layer depicting the occupancy of the dynamic and static objects. By using this 2D traffic scene representation, future prediction can be modeled as a video processing problem, where future time-serial image sequence need to be predicted. In order to predict future traffic scenes based on past traffic scenes, a deep learning architecture is proposed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks. With the proposed deep learning architecture, future prediction accuracy in highly conflicting traffic situation is guaranteed up to 90 percent with 3 seconds of prediction horizon.

Nominally this scheme should be formulated in a centralized way with the constraints of all the vehicles considered simultaneously. In order to facilitate the numerical solving process of this centralized optimization problem, we propose a stepwise computation framework. Starting with a sub-problem with all of the collision avoidance constraints removed, a sequence of sub-problems are defined by adding back the removed collision avoidance constraints gradually until the original problem takes shape in the end. The optimum of one sub-problem is always used as the initial guess when solving the next sub-problem. This iterative process continues until the optimum of the original problem is obtained. In this way, the difficulties in the original centralized problem are divided into multiple parts, and every progress made to address the partial difficulties is “solidified” by the initial guess.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500384","","Planning;Roads;Kinematics;Collision avoidance;Electronic mail;Optimization;Systems engineering and theory","collision avoidance;iterative methods;optimisation;path planning;road traffic control;road vehicles","original centralized problem;lane change motion planning;stepwise computational framework;multiple connected automated vehicles;hard collision avoidance constraints;numerical solving process;centralized optimization problem;stepwise computation framework","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A recursive value (RV) model is formulated for turn-by-turn navigation. The policy matrix is solved by a combination of the RV model and reinforcement learning, together with a comprehensive agent-based microscopic simulation platform we have developed. We show that even for very large road networks, very efficient manoeuvring algorithms can be readily found with reinforcement learning, especially with our RV model as the initial state. Such algorithms are indispensable for the fleet of driverless taxis, and can also give helpful recommendations to human drivers operating taxis.

However, all the current approaches to autonomous driving require the automotive manufacturers to shoulder the primary responsibility and liability associated with replacing human perception and decision making with automation, potentially slowing the penetration of autonomous vehicles, and consequently slowing the realization of the societal benefits of autonomous vehicles. We propose here a new approach to autonomous driving that will re-balance the responsibility and liabilities associated with autonomous driving between traditional automotive manufacturers, private infrastructure players, and third-party players. Our proposed distributed intelligence architecture leverages the significant advancements in connectivity and edge computing in the recent decades to partition the driving functions between the vehicle, edge computers on the road side, and specialized third-party computers that reside in the vehicle. Infrastructure becomes a critical enabler for autonomy. With this Infrastructure Enabled Autonomy (IEA) concept, the traditional automotive manufacturers will only need to shoulder responsibility and liability comparable to what they already do today, and the infrastructure and third-party players will share the added responsibility and liabilities associated with autonomous functionalities. We propose a Bayesian Network Model based framework for assessing the risk benefits of such a distributed intelligence architecture. An additional benefit of the proposed architecture is that it enables “autonomy as a service” while still allowing for private ownership of automobiles.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500436","autonomous vehicles;infrastructure;connectivity;edge computing;distributed intelligence architecture","Autonomous vehicles;Automobiles;Decision making;Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Laser radar","automobile manufacture;automobiles;belief networks;decision making;distributed processing;environmental factors;mobile robots;risk management;socio-economic effects","distributed intelligence architecture;autonomous vehicles;infrastructure enabled autonomy;societal aspects;environmental aspects;economic aspects;automotive manufacturers;decision making;Bayesian network model based framework;risk benefits;automobiles;specialized third-party computers;edge computing","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Macro-actions allow for temporal extension over multiple time steps and increase the effective search depth requiring fewer iterations to plan over longer horizons. Without predefined policies for macro-actions, the algorithm simultaneously learns policies over and within macro-actions.

In order to maintain low computation times, it is advantageous to have a convex formulation, in general requiring the planning problem to be separated into a longitudinal and lateral component. However, this decoupling of the motion often results in infeasible trajectories in situations in which both components need to be heavily linked, e.g., when planning swerving maneuvers to avoid a collision with obstacles. In this work, we propose an approach which extends the convex optimization problem of the longitudinal component to incorporate changing constraints, allowing us to guarantee feasibility of the resulting combined trajectory.

In the proposed deep learning-based parking system, a novel iterative two-stage learning framework is utilized to predict the steering angles and gear status using a front and back mounted monocular camera. In the first stage of the proposed framework, the encoder-decoder architecture is used to predict an initial estimate of the steering angle trajectory from multiple frames of the front or the back monocular camera. The camera used for steering estimated is selected using the gear status estimate. The gear status is predefined during initialization and estimated subsequently in the second stage of the proposed framework. In the second stage of the proposed framework, the initial estimate of the steering angle trajectory along with the vehicles heading angle, and absolute position is given as an input to the long short-term memory network to estimate the optimal steering angle and gear status.

Thereby, the MPC problem is converted into the problem of optimal control with constraints and a receding-horizon approach is utilized to compute the desired vehicle acceleration. The real-time estimation of road adhesion coefficient is accomplished by the recursive least square (RLS) method. A four-degree-of-freedom (4DOF) nonlinear vehicle model is established based on the Lagrangian approach to act as the actual vehicle in the ACC system. The proposed ACC scheme is evaluated by simulations respectively in high and low adhesion conditions.

Different proposals cope with the massive testing effort to assure the safety of such systems. These proposals include virtualization of testing, usage of stochastic methods and reduction of the necessary real world driving tests. Despite these different approaches, they all rely on the same basis: The behavior assessment of the vehicle under test, which results in a measurement of risk. This paper presents a novel approach to measure the criticality of a given driving scenario fitted on the requirements of testing.

In this paper, we propose a human-like behavior generation approach, which can make safe as well as efficient decisions and generate an appropriate path with the corresponding speed profile to interact with the surrounding vehicles. Firstly, a cumulative cost map is constructed by integrating the hybrid potential maps of the surrounding vehicles according to their categories. Subsequently, three candidate paths, i.e., a route-following path, an in-lane circumventing path and a collision-avoidance path, are extracted to form a Markov decision process (MDP) model. The optimal decision to cope with the current situation, e.g., when and how to perform a passing maneuver with parked vehicles in the host lane, are finally made in the MDP model such that the actual path and target speed profile will be generated. Particularly, three driving modes, i.e., Leisure Mode, Normat Mode and Efficiency Mode, are provided to the driver/passengers to adjust the decision making strategy such that the generated human-like automated driving commands will make them not only feel safe by the collision-free trajectories but also feel at ease by meeting their preferences and needs.

Model-based development and calibration can be employed to optimize the corresponding actuator control algorithm in the transmission control unit (TCU). In this paper, the challenge is to realize on-line adaptively optimization of the controller based on position trajectory. The clutch in an automated manual transmission system is taken as a case study and is considered as a nonlinear dynamic system with uncertainties and unknown external disturbances. A controller with accurate and rapid position trajectory tracking performance is crucial to finding out the correlation between the clutch position changes and the shift quality. Traditionally, the control parameters are manually tuned off-line via trial-and-error, which is time-consuming and often yield poor results. Besides, any controller with constant control parameters has limited ability to adapt to dynamic, real-world conditions. This study proposes a second-order sliding-mode position controller. The parameters are improved based on neural network, to control the clutch system to get better tracking performance on-line adaptive during the vehicle starting. Finally, the clutch controller is embedded into a Modelica<sup>®</sup>based vehicle model and verified through the Model-in-the-Loop(MiL) simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that the controller has better tracking performance and stronger robustness compared to the conventional controller and its parameters can be efficiently tuned online via neural networking as opposed to trial-and-error.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500691","Clutch;Sliding Mode Control;Neural Network;On-line Adaptive","Adaptation models;Vehicle dynamics;Observers;Biological neural networks;Adaptive systems;Trajectory","actuators;adaptive control;clutches;neurocontrollers;nonlinear dynamical systems;position control;power transmission (mechanical);road vehicles;robust control;uncertain systems;variable structure systems;vehicle dynamics","rapid position trajectory tracking performance;clutch position changes;constant control parameters;second-order sliding-mode position controller;neural network;clutch system;clutch controller;Model-in-the-Loop(MiL) simulation;neural networking;On-line Adaptive Position Control;AMT clutch systems;evaluation criteria;automated transmission control algorithms;riding comfort;calibration;transmission control unit;on-line adaptively optimization;automated manual transmission system;nonlinear dynamic system;unknown external disturbances;emission requirements;position trajectory tracking performance;sliding-mode online adaptive position control;Modelica based vehicle model;model-in-the-loop simulation;actuator control algorithm;uncertainties","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The evaluation of algorithms for object extraction or the training and validation of learning algorithms rely on labeled ground truth data. Manually annotating objects in a DOGMa to obtain ground truth data is a time consuming and expensive process. Additionally the quality of labeled data depend strongly on the variation of filtered input data. The presented work introduces an automatic labeling process, where a full sequence is used to extract the best possible object pose and shape in terms of temporal consistency. A two direction temporal search is executed to trace single objects over a sequence, where the best estimate of its extent and pose is refined in every time step.

In this paper we present an approach that achieves competitive performance on the challenging KITTI Object Detection and orientation Estimation benchmark while being the fastest approach with over 40 FPS.

We extend SSD-a current fast state-of-the-art 2D box object detector- with this representation to our MB-Net.

The main objective is to ensure computational efficiency in the approach, while still ensuring collision avoidance with moving obstacles and respecting vehicle constraints such as comfort criteria and roll-over limits. The trajectory planning problem is separated into finding a collision free corridor in space- time domain using a support vector machine (SVM), which means solving a convex optimization problem. After that a time-monotonic path is found in the collision free corridor by solving a simple search problem that can be solved efficiently. The resulting path in space-time domain corresponds to the resulting planned trajectory of the vehicle. The planner is a deterministic search method associated with a cost function that keeps the trajectory kinematically feasible and close to the maximum separating surface, given by the SVM. A kinematic motion model is used to construct motion primitives in the space-time domain representing the non-holonomic behavior of the vehicle and is used to ensure physical constraints on the states of the vehicle such as acceleration, speed, jerk, steer and steer rate. The speed limits include limitations by law and also rollover speed limits.

In case of GNSS outages, such as in urban canyons or tunnels, highly automated cars cannot localize without an initial known position. In this paper we propose a method for absolute localization in a city based on only one 2D laser scanner. In out method, localization is done by matching vertical scan lines captured by a 2D laser scanner mounted on the vehicle with scan lines derived from a reference point cloud of the environment. We use a neural network to derive significant features describing the shape of the scan lines. Every scan line of a reference data set is labeled with a specific cluster-id using a k-means algorithm and stored in a reference graph. The same k-means algorithm is used to label the single scan lines of a test drive. The localization is done via a sequence mining approach, where a sequence with a specific length is matched to the position with the highest correlation in the reference sequence. In our experiments we analyze the effect of several parameters, including the number of features and sequence length. The results show that the algorithm performs with an accuracy of about 1.4 m and a completeness of up to 99%.

The experiment results demonstrate that the relative distance has great influence on the comfort level of human drivers compared to relative speed; and the integrated influence of relative distance and speed between AV and the behind target vehicle have an important role in the influence.

Few protocols exist to deliver remote data to autonomous vehicles - for example observation meta-data or sensor streams such as camera, LIDAR, etc. Researchers bypass this problem by using a single Robot OS controller or rudimentary streaming pipes. However, with recent advancements in vehicle to everything (V2X) protocols, including better LTE and millimeter wave (MMwave) communications in mobile environments, a dedicated multiple-source streaming protocol is increasingly necessary. For this reason, we developed a protocol that allows multiple and distinct transmitters of data to stream sensor information to a single receiver with features including session management, encryption, and jitter regulation. The Synchronized Buffer proposed herein seeks to synchronize data frames by their time stamps, in the spirit of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) used in VoIP. We validated the proposed time synchronization algorithm by streaming data at different simulated data frames per second. Quality of service (QoS) and potential security flaws are also explored. Such a dedicated streaming protocol addresses current problems by allowing vehicles to integrate previously unavailable remote data sources into critical autonomous decision making.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500470","","Synchronization;Protocols;Transmitters;Receivers;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Clocks;Computer architecture","decision making;jitter;mobile communication;quality of service;transport protocols","vehicle to everything protocols;dedicated streaming protocol;critical autonomous decision making;unavailable remote data sources;time synchronization algorithm;Real-Time Transport Protocol;Synchronized Buffer;single receiver;sensor information;multiple transmitters;multiple-source streaming protocol;single Robot OS controller;autonomous vehicles;autonomous driving;vehicle control;multiple data streams","","","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates the relationships between several safety indicators (e.g., time gap, gap distance, time to collision) in car-following situations, and analyzes which of these indicators affect driver's behavior in car-following situations and how. All analyses are done using real driving data collected in China. The paper also suggests parameters that can be used for defining, identifying, and extracting car-following events from real driving data. Results indicate that time gap is less sensitive to the variations in speed and road condition compared with gap distance in this test. TTC in the low speed range of subject-vehicle is found to be steady compared with other speed ranges, so is the time gap in the high speed range. Therefore, time gap is more suitable to be the safety indicator compared with gap distance in the future car-following research.

Obstacles are mobile and with the anticipation of their movement, motion and path of this optimal dynamic minimum are jointly generated. The effects of adding this anticipation in the planning are illustrated, and the optimization is done using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), to improve the Potential Fields (PF) method. In the first two parts of this article, the problem is formulated and the different criteria are described. Then, a GA-PF method is proposed. Finally simulations of the potential field method and its combination with a genetic algorithm are presented.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500379","","Planning;Genetic algorithms;Meters;Torque;Trajectory optimization","aerospace robotics;collision avoidance;genetic algorithms;mobile robots;trajectory optimisation (aerospace)","potential field method;rough trajectories;multicriteria trajectory optimization;unmanned terrestrial vehicles;genetic algorithm;GA-PF method;mobile obstacles;potential fields method;autonomous vehicles;trajectory planning methods","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the principle of maximizing the regenerative braking torque of four motors, the motor and the hydraulic braking force of both front and rear axles have been allocated to four wheels respectively, and the fuzzy control method is adopted to control the vehicle's slip rate under the emergency braking. The paper first analyzes two common regenerative braking control methods of IWM: half-bridge modulation and full-bridge modulation, and compares the modulation effect of the two control methods. Then, the braking force allocation strategy is proposed, which can be divided into two parts: under normal braking and under emergency braking. Finally, the braking force allocation strategy is verified through the co-simulation platform of Carsim, Matlab/Simulink and AMEsim. The simulation results show that under normal braking, the proposed Uraking force allocation strategy can preferentially adopt the motor braking force according to the maximum motor Uraking force. When the total braking force provided by the motors cannot meet the vehicle's braking severity requirements, EHB system involves in braking to provide the remaining braking force. Under emergency braking, the slip rate can be well controlled by the fuzzy control method.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500510","","Modulation;Force;Switches;Batteries;Inductance;Electron tubes;Equivalent circuits","axles;brakes;DC motors;electric vehicles;electrohydraulic control equipment;force control;fuzzy control;hydraulic systems;regenerative braking;slip;vehicle dynamics;wheels","regenerative braking torque;hydraulic braking force;fuzzy control method;emergency braking;distributed compound braking system;braking force allocation strategy;electric vehicles;in-wheel motors;axles;slip rate;half-bridge modulation;full-bridge modulation;Carsim;Matlab;Simulink;AMEsim;EHB system","","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Autonomous vehicles should also man- age these situations by behaving cooperatively and naturally. In this paper, we enhance our previous learning-based method to efficiently estimate other vehicles' intentions and interact with them in ramp merging scenarios, without over-the-air communication between vehicles. The proposed approach inherits our previous Probabilistic grahpical Model (PGM) and distance- keeping framework. Real driving trajectories are used to learn transition models in the PGM. Thus, besides the structure of the PGM, our method does not require human-designed reward or cost functions. The PGM-based intention estimation is followed by an off-the-shelf distance-keeping model to generate proper acceleration/deceleration controls. The PGM plays a plug-in role in our self-driving framework. The new model eliminates two assumptions in the previous model: 1) a fixed merging point for all merging agents, which is hard to determine before the merging vehicles make the merge; 2) Perfect velocity measurement, which requires sophisticated perception systems. We validate the performance of our method both on real merging data and using a designed merging strategy in simulation, and show significant improvements compared with previous methods. Parameter design is also discussed by experiments. The new method is computationally efficient, and exhibits better robustness against sensing uncertainty.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500576","","Merging;Automobiles;Estimation;Sensors;Autonomous automobiles;Smoothing methods;Autonomous vehicles","acceleration control;automobiles;control engineering computing;driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;motion control;multi-agent systems;road traffic control;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing;velocity control","smooth behavioral estimation;ramp merging control;driving behavior;autonomous vehicles;driving trajectories;off-the-shelf distance-keeping model;PGM;deceleration controls;acceleration controls;probabilistic grahpical model;cooperative driving behavior","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this paper proposed a Stackelberg-based shared control scheme to describe the driver-automation interactions, in which driver and electric power steering (EPS) system are modeled as game players. Both agents have their own target paths and give their torque control strategies to track the paths through a steering interface. The interactive pattern is deliberately designed dependent on the Stackelberg game principles, with driver the leader and EPS the follower to save more steering efforts for the driver. In the beginning, a dynamic model of the driver-automation system and path-tracking optimal control problem are given to describe the maneuver behavior of driver and EPS controller. In particular, a Stackelberg-based shared control scheme is adopted to deal with interaction patterns of the steering torque between the driver and EPS system. Furthermore, a Stackelberg equilibrium solution is derived by application of a model predictive control method. Numerical analyses are processed to validate the shared control algorithm in a lane change maneuver, and the related results show that the Stackelberg-based shared control scheme is capable of saving more maneuver force for driver than that of the Nash scheme. It indicates that the proposed scheme enables the driver-automation system to overtake or avoid collision easily, which may be conductive to understanding of the steering mechanism of intelligent co-pilot vehicles.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500463","","Vehicles;Torque;Vehicle dynamics;Games;Man-machine systems;Steering systems;Resistance","collision avoidance;game theory;optimal control;predictive control;road vehicles;steering systems;torque control","Stackelberg game theory;shared steering torque control;lane change maneuver;human-machine interactions;driver-automation conflicts;co-piloting system;driver-automation interactions;electric power steering system;torque control strategies;steering interface;Stackelberg game principles;driver-automation system;path-tracking optimal control problem;EPS controller;Stackelberg equilibrium solution;model predictive control method;shared control algorithm;steering mechanism","","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a fast object detection method based on a single stage and a single extended feature map. A Iightweight network based on an extended paththrough layer is proposed to improve both the accuracy and speed. The extended paththrough layer enlarges the resolution of the last feature map by concatenating later feature maps with lower resolution to earlier feature map maps with higher resolution.

One of the main problems when comparing different semantic segmentation solutions is how to select an appropriate metric to evaluate their accuracy. On the one hand, classic metrics do not measure properly the accuracy on the object contours, which is important in urban driving to differentiate road from sidewalk for instance. On the other hand, contour-based metrics [1] disregard the information far from class contours. This paper explores the problem multi-modal image segmentation, and presents a new metric to leverage global and contour accuracy in a simple formulation.

In this paper, we propose a method for training a supervisor that selects proper DAS by deep reinforcement learning. The driving policy operates based on camera images and LIDAR data that are accessible in autonomous vehicles. Therefore, deep reinforcement learning network model is designed to analyze both camera image and LIDAR data. This system aims to drive in simulated traffic situation of highway without collision and with high speed. Unlike the systems which learn how to throttle, brake and steering directly, the proposed method can guarantee safe driving because the learned driving policy is based on the existing commercialized DAS functions.

In this work, we learn a policy for urban intersection crossing using DRL and introduce a method to automatically generate the curriculum for the training process from a candidate set of tasks. We compare the performance of the automatically generated curriculum (AGC) training to those of randomly generated sequences and show that AGC can significantly reduce the training time while achieving similar or better performance.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500603","","Training;Autonomous vehicles;Task analysis;Learning (artificial intelligence);Machine learning;Heuristic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots","optimal curriculum;human handcrafting;urban intersection crossing;DRL;training process;automatically generated curriculum training;randomly generated sequences;autonomous vehicles;urban environment;autonomous driving behaviors;urban intersections;deep reinforcement learning;autonomous agents;training iterations necessary increase;curriculum learning;required training time;AGC","","2","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While such annotations are helpful in manual selection of data, they are insufficient for comprehensive and quantitate measurement of per-roadway-segment scenario complexity. To resolve such limitations, we propose a traffic sensory data classification paradigm based on quantifying the scenario complexity for each roadway segment, where such quantification is jointly based on road semantic complexity and traffic element complexity. The road semantic complexity is a proposed measurement of the complexity incurred by the static elements such as curvy roads, intersections, merges and splits, which is predicted with a Support Vector Regression (SVR). The traffic element complexity is a measurement of complexity due to dynamic traffic elements, such as nearby vehicles and pedestrians. Experimental results and a case study verify the efficacy of the proposed method.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500669","","Complexity theory;Roads;Semantics;Testing;Robot sensing systems;Unmanned vehicles","mobile robots;pattern classification;regression analysis;remotely operated vehicles;road traffic;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing","road semantic complexity;traffic element complexity;unmanned ground vehicle;traffic scenario data;off-line traffic sensory dataset;per-roadway-segment scenario complexity;traffic sensory data classification paradigm;SVR;support vector regression;cognitive algorithms;UGV off-line testing","","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While great progress has been made, state-of-the-art algorithms still fail at times. Such failures may have catastrophic consequences. It therefore is im- portant that automated cars foresee problems ahead as early as possible. This is also of paramount importance if the driver will be asked to take over. We conjecture that failures do not occur randomly. For instance, driving models may fail more likely at places with heavy traffic, at complex intersections, and/or under adverse weather/illumination conditions. This work presents a method to learn to predict the occurrence of these failures, i.e., to assess how difficult a scene is to a given driving model and to possibly give the human driver an early headsup. A camera- based driving model is developed and trained over real driving datasets. The discrepancies between the model's predictions and the human 'ground-truth' maneuvers were then recorded, to yield the 'failure' scores. Experimental results show that the failure score can indeed be learned and predicted. Thus, our prediction method is able to improve the overall safety of an automated driving model by alerting the human driver timely, leading to better human-vehicle collaborative driving.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500495","","Autonomous vehicles;Predictive models;Automobiles;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Computer architecture","automobiles;driver information systems;human-robot interaction;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;road safety;robot vision;safety-critical software;traffic engineering computing","human-vehicle collaborative driving;failure prediction;automated driving model;autonomous driving;adverse weather conditions;adverse illumination conditions;camera-based driving model","","","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Predicting motions of pedestrians is especially hard since they move in less structured environments and have less inertia compared to road vehicles. To account for this uncertainty, we present an approach for probabilistic prediction of pedestrian motion using Markov chains. In contrast to previous work, we not only consider motion models, constraints from a semantic map, and various goals, but also explicitly adapt the prediction based on crash probabilities with other traffic participants. Also, our approach works in any situation; this is typically challenging for pure machine learning techniques that learn behaviors for a particular road section and which might consequently struggle with a different road section.

Automation also comes with a variety of downsides e.g. loss of situation awareness, loss of skills as well as inappropriate trust levels regarding system functionality. Drawbacks differ between automation levels. As highly-automated driving (level 3) requires the driver to take over the driving task in critical situations within a limited period of time, the need for an appropriate human-machine interface (HMI) arises. To foster adequate and efficient humanmachine interaction, this contribution presents a user-centered, iterative approach for HMI design for highly-automated truck driving.An expert workshop was conducted to develop first ideas and HMI ketches. Workshop results were combined with scientific findings regarding HMI design for highly-automated car driving. Based on those findings, a paper prototype was created and evaluated with experts, using an approach of mixed qualitative methods (heuristic evaluation, thinking aloud). The outcome was implemented to the HMI concept. In a third step, the HMI was conceptualized as video prototype enabling a more detailed evaluation. Again, experts were asked to assess the HMI using qualitative (thinking aloud) and quantitative methods (questionnaires).The result represents a video prototype showing a HMI strategy for highly-automated driving, aiming at fostering a successful human-machine interaction. Relevant issues such as drivers' informational needs, situation awareness and trust were explicitly considered during HMI design.

The identified maneuver information with the corresponding driver ID is useful for the supervised learning of high-level feature abstraction with neural network. With the aim of analyzing the sensory data with deep learning in a consumable form, we propose a joint histogram feature map to regularize the shallow features in this paper. Besides, extensive simulation is conducted to evaluate different machine learning and deep learning methodologies for optimal driving behavior characterization. Overall, our results indicate that Deep Neural Network (DNN) is suitable for the driving maneuver classification task with more than 94% accuracy, while Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network performs well with a 92% accuracy in identifying a specific driver. However, LSTM shows degraded accuracy when the scale of the identification task becomes larger. In this case, a hierarchical deep learning model is proposed, and simulation results show that the combination of DNN and LSTM in this hierarchical model can well maintain the prediction accuracy even when the scale of the recognition task is four times larger.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500376","Deep Learning;Machine Learning;Statistical Analysis;Driving Behaviour aassification;Autonomous Driving","Vehicles;Machine learning;Global Positioning System;Statistical analysis;Task analysis;Neural networks;Trajectory","driver information systems;feature extraction;Global Positioning System;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;recurrent neural nets;road vehicles;sensors;statistical analysis","autonomous driving;big data;input sensor data;autonomous vehicles;semantic-level driving characteristics;safe driving control;handcrafted driving features;feature classification;sematic-level driving behaviors;large-scale GPS sensor data;layer-by-layer statistical analysis method;supervised learning;high-level feature abstraction;sensory data;joint histogram feature map;deep learning methodologies;optimal driving behavior characterization;driving maneuver classification task;hierarchical deep learning model;deep neural network modelling;driving behaviors;machine learning;long short-term memory neural network;driver","","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, reasonable tuning strategy of the look-ahead distance is very important to the application of the geometric controllers. This paper proposed a more robust tuning strategy for all the geometric controllers based on the careful analysis of the previous methods. Instead of utilizing as much as possible elements, we just want to make use of only two variables, the distance from the current location to the reference path and the changing rate of it. Fuzzy logic was utilized to combine these two variables to tune the look-ahead distance. We will show that we just use two variables, but we actually consider another two variables' affections indirectly. Lastly, we will add our strategy to two different classical geometric controllers and compare the relative benefits of previous tuning strategies.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500623","Geometric controller;Path tracking;Fuzzy logic","Tuning;Fuzzy logic;Input variables;Autonomous vehicles;Computational modeling;Automobiles","control system synthesis;fuzzy logic;mobile robots;position control;road vehicles;robust control","robust look-ahead distance tuning strategy;geometric path tracking controllers;autonomous vehicles;fuzzy logic","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research proposes a humanlike trajectory planning method by learning from naturalistic driving data. A cost function is formulated by incorporating not only the components on comfort, efficiency and safety, but also lane incentive by referring to a human driver's lane change decisions. Coefficients of the cost components are learnt by correlating the probability of a trajectory being selected with its distance (i.e. similarity) to the human driven one at the same driving situation. A data set is developed by using the naturalistic data of human drivers on the motorways in Beijing, containing samples of lane changes to the left and right lanes, and car followings. Experiments are conducted on three aspects: 1) lane change trajectory planning to a given target lane; 2) lane change trajectory planning with simultaneous decision of a target lane; and 3) trajectory planning with simultaneous decision of maneuver.

The Markov Chain process is combined with a transition probability extracted from the input driving data to determine the next possible state of the vehicle. Specifically, the velocity and slope are generated simultaneously using a three-dimensional Markov Chain model. After the generation process, the result is validated by selected criteria. Furthermore, this synthesis can generate the driving cycle with the desired length to compress the original driving cycle.

Being familiar with roads topology and other vehicles' routes, experienced drivers could usually find a near optimal route. However, the nowadays navigation applications hardly catch the domain knowledge and drivers' interaction in this scenario. In fact, they only recommend several routes and leave the most difficult decision to driver. Hence the route is often congested by many vehicles whose drivers make a similar choose. To intelligently make right decision on navigation and improve traffic efficiency for each vehicle, we propose a neural network structure which learns to plan coarse-grained route in complex urban areas.Focused on learning to navigate, this paper first formalizes urban map and vehicle route model. The city map is segmented into grids and each vehicle's route is mapped to grids. Based on grid-world model, we solicit both global traffic status and driving actions from large-scale taxicab GPS data. The learn-to-plan problem is therefore to find a policy function from a global status representation to an experienced driver's action under that status. Traditional neural network is difficult to learn to this plan-involved function, so we leverage and modify value iteration network (VIN), which explicitly takes long-term plan into consideration. Finally we evaluate the performance of proposed network on real map and trajectory data in Beijing, China. The results show that VIN can achieve human driver performance in most cases, with high success rate and less commuting time.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500517","","Navigation;Vehicles;Planning;Urban areas;Trajectory;Roads;Biological neural networks","Global Positioning System;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);navigation;neural nets;optimisation;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","value iteration network;long-term plan;trajectory data;human driver performance;roads topology;experienced drivers;domain knowledge;traffic efficiency;neural network structure;coarse-grained route;complex urban areas;grid-world model;global traffic status;driving actions;learn-to-plan problem;global status representation;policy function;taxicab GPS data;urban map formalization;near optimal route;urban navigation learning","","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A reasonable threshold is set to derive the highlighting feature areas and Scharr operator is used to find vertical edges. These areas are not necessarily connected to each other in the image. We think an upright pedestrian is a highly structured target consisting of highlighting feature areas and vertical feature areas. The distribution of feature areas is demonstrated using a skeleton model. So we apply the dilating morphological operation to ensure that these adjacent feature areas within pedestrians' regions will connect together.

In such methods, the source of self-Iocalization error can be divided into input scan quality, matching algorithm and map. In this work, we focus on the map, as one ofthe high potential sources of error. By investigating the erroneous scenarios in the map and comparing their characteristics, we come up with some criteria and requirements for the map to be able to perform self-Iocalization with a needed error. In this work, we propose four factors for quantified evaluation ofthe map requirements. These factors are feature count factor, layout factor, normal entropy factor, and local similarity factor ofthe map. We evaluated these four factors in a different part ofthe map with different scenarios by comparing them with the self-Iocalization error. Experimental results show that the local similarity factor with 0.59 of correlation with the maximum error has the highest contribution to the Iocalization error. For normal entropy factor, feature count factor, layout factor, correlations are 0.42, 0.36, and 0.34 respectively. By applying these four factors, maximum Iocalization error can be modeled with RMSE and R-squared (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.44 and 0.598 respectively.

This paper proposes and analyzes an improved forward scheme for full deplex cooperative vehicular networks in terms of its CPSS features. The proposed CPSS-based forwarding (CPSS-F) strategy forwards a soft estimate of the received signal based on social historic data at the relay node (vehicle/infrastructure) to the destination node (vehicle/infrastructure), which achieves improved reliability than the two conventional strategies in cooperative networks, i.e., amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). Furthermore, the proposed CPSS-F relay achieves performance gains and complexity reduction compared to the conventional AF and DF. Experimental results further confirm the advantages of the proposed CPSS-F for cooperative vehicular networks.

Computer vision based techniques with monocular detectors or depth sensors sprung up within years of research. These separate approaches achieved remarkable results with relatively low processing time, and improved the mobility of visually impaired people to a large extent.

This is critical not only for the terrain awareness regarding traversable areas, sidewalks, stairs and water hazards, but also for the avoidance of short-range obstacles, fast-approaching pedestrians and vehicles.

Unfortunately, these devices do not have communications capabilities to broadcast this information to all vehicles in proximity, and also this strategy requires functioning devices on all pedestrians to work. This paper presents a robust perception method that is able to extract dynamic pedestrian information with accuracy comparable to that of typical gyroscopes and accelerometers installed in wearable devices. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the potential for obtaining very comprehensive dynamic information from limbs representing the skeleton of a pedestrian.

Outdoor visual localization generates large amounts of data that need to be incorporated into a lifelong visual map in order to allow localization at all times and under all appearance conditions. Processing these large quantities of data is non-trivial, as it is subject to limited computational and storage capabilities both on the vehicle and on the mapping backend. We address this problem with a two-fold map update paradigm capable of, either, adding new visual cues to the map, or updating co-observation statistics. The former, in combination with offline map summarization techniques, allows enhancing the appearance coverage of the lifelong map while keeping the map size limited. On the other hand, the latter is able to significantly boost the appearance-based landmark selection for efficient online localization without incurring any additional computational or storage burden. Our evaluation in challenging outdoor conditions shows that our proposed map management process allows building and maintaining maps for precise visual localization over long time spans in a tractable and scalable fashion.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500432","","Visualization;Buildings;Robot sensing systems;Autonomous automobiles;Maintenance engineering;Bandwidth;Intelligent vehicles","automobiles;mobile robots;path planning;robot vision;SLAM (robots)","appearance-based landmark selection;visual localization system;multivehicle long-term operations;resource constrained outdoor environments;outdoor visual localization;lifelong visual map;appearance conditions;mapping backend;two-fold map update paradigm;visual cues;offline map summarization techniques;appearance coverage;long-term visual localization;map management process;autonomous cars","","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the continuous decision making (CDM) framework is proposed to formulate different driving scenarios in a unified way, which encodes the high level decision making information into a continuous reference trajectory that can be naturally combined with a lower level trajectory planner. Within the framework, a maximum interaction defensive policy (MIDP) is proposed, which calculates the best action to interact with stochastic moving obstacles while guaranteeing safety.

In these situations, a common strategy is to suppress acceleration and maintain current speed (Cruise Control) until the sensor detects the preceding vehicle again. In this paper, we propose a new solution which integrates odometry and inter-vehicular communication to enable vehicle following for the period of target detection loss. With intervehicular communication, a following vehicle can obtain the odometry data of its preceding vehicle to compute the intervehicle distance. This work focuses on the design of an ACC system that can enable vehicle following during short-term target detection loss.

Most current approaches use monocular or stereo cameras to detect these. However, LiDAR sensors are becoming more common and offer unique properties for road area detection such as precision and robustness to weather conditions. We therefore propose two approaches for a pixel-wise semantic binary segmentation of the road area based on a modified U-Net Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture. The first approach UView-Cam employs a single camera image, whereas the second approach UGrid-Fused incorporates a early fusion of LiDAR and camera data into a multi-dimensional occupation grid representation as FCN input. The fusion of camera and LiDAR allows for efficient and robust leverage of individual sensor properties in a single FCN.

The published works have turned cameras into a very precise source of ego motion estimation. However, for automotive application, visual odometry has to be integrated into a sensor fusion to simultaneously obtain global localization, maximum availability as well as highest precision. Since any visual odometry remains sensitive to its environment, good motion estimation cannot always be guaranteed. Consequently, a self-validation scheme is one of the barriers towards application in a sensor fusion system. In order to solve this problem, we first formulate an Ackermann vehicle's motion as a function of its forward speed and yaw rate. Secondly, we present a data-driven model, which achieves to reconstruct the sideward speed as a function of the yaw rate only. As we show, both models reach the quality of the estimated sideward motion from visual odometry. The therewith achieved redundancy can be used for different tasks. Of course, the estimation of the sideward motion can be excluded from the visual odometry scheme to save computation time. This is of special interest for monocular systems, where yet no absolute scale of a translation motion could be directly calculated. Instead, we propose to maintain the estimation of the sideward motion in the visual odometry and to compare the result to the modeled motion. As we show, the emerging deviation is a very good metric for self-validation of the overall visual odometry estimate. Integrating the resulting method into our visual odometry system, we currently achieve the best frame-to-frame result in the KITTI benchmark.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500560","","Visual odometry;Motion estimation;Adaptive optics;Optical imaging;Cameras;Sensor fusion;Robot sensing systems","cameras;distance measurement;image fusion;image sensors;iterative methods;motion estimation;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","automotive visual odometry;ego motion estimation;automotive application;sensor fusion system;Ackermann vehicle;yaw rate;visual odometry scheme;visual odometry system;motion estimation","","1","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Globally localizing information, such as a GPS signal, can be unreliable due to signal shadowing and multipath errors. Detailed a priori maps of the environment with sufficient information for autonomous navigation typically require driving the area multiple times to collect large amounts of data, substantial post-processing on that data to obtain the map, and then maintaining updates on the map as the environment changes. This paper addresses the issue of autonomous driving in an urban environment by investigating algorithms and an architecture to enable fully functional autonomous driving with limited information. An algorithm to autonomously navigate urban roadways with little to no reliance on an a priori map or GPS is developed. Localization is performed with an extended Kalman filter with odometry, compass, and sparse landmark measurement updates. Navigation is accomplished by a compass-based navigation control law. Key results from Monte Carlo studies show success rates of urban navigation under different environmental conditions. Experiments validate the simulated results and demonstrate that, for given test conditions, an expected range can be found for a given success rate.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500693","","Global Positioning System;Autonomous vehicles;Urban areas;Compass;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Databases","distance measurement;Global Positioning System;Kalman filters;mobile robots;Monte Carlo methods;path planning;road vehicles;SLAM (robots)","autonomous urban localization;urban environment;challenging scenario;globally localizing information;GPS signal;signal shadowing;multipath errors;sufficient information;autonomous navigation;area multiple times;substantial post-processing;environment changes;fully functional autonomous driving;urban roadways;sparse landmark measurement updates;compass-based navigation control law;urban navigation;Monte Carlo studies","","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this contribution, an approach is developed based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for predicting human driving behaviors. Three different driving maneuvers including left/right lane change and lane keeping are modeled as hidden states for the HMM. Based on observations (training), the HMM approach is able to calculate the most possible driving behaviors using observed sequences. Furthermore, the observed sequences are also used for training of HMM in the modeling process. To improve the prediction performance of the model, a prefilter is proposed to quantize the collected signals into observed sequences with specific features. In this contribution the definition of a suitable prefilter will be discussed and finally optimized. The approach focuses on the definition of optimal prefilters. Here optimality is defined as the optimal segments describing a quantized prefilter mapping the vehicle's environment to quantized states. In combination with related HMM-based results in terms of accuracy, detection, and false alarm rates an optimal parameter set of the prefilter can be determined. Using experimental data from real human driving behaviors (taken from driving simulator) it can be concluded that the optimal definition of the prefilter can increase the detection rate and accuracy, and in the meanwhile decrease the false alarm rate. The effectiveness of driving behaviors prediction has been successfully proved by comparison with other methods in this contribution.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500717","","Hidden Markov models;Vehicles;Predictive models;Training;Vehicle dynamics;Road transportation;Silicon","driver information systems;hidden Markov models;human factors;road safety","observed sequences;human driving behaviors;Advanced Driver Assistance Systems;Hidden Markov Model;HMM;human driver behavior prediction","","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this, targets that are determined from the range-Doppler-Matrix created by a 79 GHz chirp sequence radar are clustered to objects. Different classifiers then use previously calculated characteristic features of moving objects to generate the object classes “Pedestrian” and “Other”. As a result, the success rate of one measurement reaches up to 95.3% for well-suited classifiers and a bandwidth of 1.6 GHz. Moreover, the robustness of the classification process is increased by tracking the objects.

In this work, we present an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for real time detection of multiple lane boundaries using a camera sensor. Our network has a simple encoder-decoder architecture and is a special two class semantic segmentation network designed to segment lane boundaries. Efficacy of our network stems from two key insights which are at the foundation of all our design decisions. Firstly, we term a lane boundary as a weak class object in the context of semantic segmentation. We show that the weak class objects which occupy relatively few pixels in the scene, also have a relatively low detection accuracy among the know segmentation methods. We present novel design choices and intuitions to improve the segmentation accuracy of weak class objects, which in turn reduces computation time. Our second insight lies in the manner we depict the ground truth information in our derived dataset. Instead of annotating just the visible lane markers, we accurately delineate the lane boundaries in the ground truth for challenging scenarios like occlusions, low light and degraded lane markings. We then leverage the CNN's ability to concisely summarize the global and local context in an image, for accurately inferring lane boundaries in these challenging cases. We evaluate our network against ENet and FCN-8, and found it performing notably better in terms of speed and accuracy.

To achieve the level of fidelity needed for safety approval, such sensor simulations can be physically based. For formulating requirements for sensor models to be used in such test frameworks, the extent to which they must include physical effects should be determined. One approach is to clarify their relevance for following processing steps like object detection or mapping. But at first, an analysis is needed to determine, which effects are relevant and if they can be implemented at all. In this work, we focus on one lidar sensor and analyze its observable real world sensor behavior to derive the possible effects, physically based lidar sensor models can include. Consequently, we describe environmental parameters that could be considered to influence physically based lidar sensor models. By investigating the specifications given by the manufacturer with own measurements, we show that some of them should be implemented in a dynamic manner.

The driver delegates the control to the autonomous system while remaining seated in the driver's seat. The proposed study aims at giving a first insight into the definition of human perception of space applied to vehicles by testing the existence of a personal space around the car. It aims at measuring proxemic information about the driver's comfort zone in such conditions. Proxemics, or human perception of space, has been largely explored when applied to humans or to robots, leading to the concept of personal space, but poorly when applied to vehicles. In this article, we highlight the existence and the characteristics of a zone of comfort around the car which is not correlated to the risk of a collision between the car and other road users. Our experiment includes 19 volunteers using a virtual reality headset to look at 30 scenarios filmed in 360° from the point of view of a passenger sitting in the driver's seat of an autonomous car. They were asked to say “stop” when they felt discomfort visualizing the scenarios. As said, the scenarios voluntarily avoid collision effect as we do not want to measure fear but discomfort. The scenarios involve one or three pedestrians walking past the car at different distances from the wings of the car, relative to the direction of motion of the car, on both sides. The car is either static or moving straight forward at different speeds. The results indicate the existence of a comfort zone around the car in which intrusion causes discomfort. The size of the comfort zone is sensitive neither to the side of the car where the pedestrian passes nor to the number of pedestrians. In contrast, the feeling of discomfort is relative to the car's motion (static or moving). Another outcome from this study is an illustration of the usage of first person 360° video and a virtual reality headset to evaluate feelings of a passenger within an autonomous car.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500648","","Automobiles;Autonomous automobiles;Navigation;Aerospace electronics;Space vehicles;Legged locomotion","automobiles;collision avoidance;data visualisation;driver information systems;mobile robots;navigation;pedestrians;road traffic control;virtual reality","autonomous car navigating;personal space;driver seat;autonomous car passengers;pedestrians;virtual reality headset;collision avoidance","","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, main research efforts are being put on enlarging deep architectures to achieve marginal accuracy boosts in existing datasets, forgetting that these algorithms must be deployed in a real vehicle with images that were not seen during training. On the other hand, achieving robustness in any domain is not an easy task, since deep networks are prone to overfitting even with thousands of training images. In this paper, we study in a systematic way what is the gap between the concepts of “accuracy” and “robustness”. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the relevance of using data augmentation to yield models that can produce robust semantic segmentation outputs in any domain. Our results suggest that the existing domain gap can be significantly reduced when appropriate augmentation techniques regarding geometry (position and shape) and texture (color and illumination) are applied.

This urban driving requires zero error tolerance. In order to guarantee safety requirements self-driving cars and the used software have to pass exhaustive tests under as many different conditions as possible. The more versatile the considered influences and the more thorough the tests made under those influences, the safer the car will drive under real conditions. Unfortunately, it is very time and resource intensive to record the same test set of images over and over again, every time producing, or hoping for, specific conditions; especially when using real test vehicles. This is where environment simulation comes into play. This research investigates the simulation of environmental influences which may affect the sensors used in autonomous vehicles, in particular how raindrops resting on a windshield affect cameras as they may occlude large parts of the field of view. We propose a novel method to render these raindrops using Continuous Nearest Neighbor search leveraging the benefits of R-trees. The 3D scene in front of the camera, which is generated from stereo images, reflects physically correct in these drops. This leads to near photo-realistic simulated results. The derived images may be used to extend the training data sets used for machine learning without being forced to capture new real pictures.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500494","","Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Automotive components;Rendering (computer graphics);Automobiles;Rain;Image color analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;rendering (computer graphics);stereo image processing;trees (mathematics)","physically correct raindrops;camera-based object recognition;autonomous cars;urban driving;zero error tolerance;safety requirements self-driving cars;autonomous vehicles;Continuous Nearest Neighbor search;stereo images;R-trees;machine learning","","1","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) recursively estimates the stereo camera calibration by tracking salient points in 3D space that are visible in both cameras. All extrinsic parameters of the stereo camera calibration are only observable under translation and two independent rotations of the vehicle. However, when driving on urban, paved roads the vehicle performs only limited pitch or roll movement. An analysis of the Fisher information matrix reveals that in these situations especially the installation height is difficult to estimate. For these scenarios a further measurement model is added to the algorithm that utilizes the homography of salient points. This homography is induced by the planar road surface in consecutive camera images. Recognition of the road surface, when the position and orientation of the cameras is unknown, can be difficult. Therefore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed that segments camera images pixel-wisely into three classes: `road', `static (other)' and `potentially dynamic'. Only salient points that are segmented as `road' are considered for the homography measurement model. Points that are segmented as `potentially dynamic' are not taken into account for the calibration algorithm. The structure of the CNN has been chosen carefully to enable segmentation of camera images on a mid-range GPU on-board of our autonomous vehicle. An evaluation of the extended algorithm, based on a recorded dataset, shows a considerably faster estimation of the installation height.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500487","","Cameras;Calibration;Image segmentation;Roads;Three-dimensional displays;Heuristic algorithms;Robot vision systems","calibration;cameras;image filtering;image segmentation;Kalman filters;neural nets;nonlinear filters;recursive estimation;stereo image processing","extended Kalman filter;extended algorithm;autonomous vehicle;calibration algorithm;homography measurement model;segments camera images;consecutive camera images;planar road surface;paved roads;urban roads;extrinsic parameters;cameras;stereo camera calibration;stereo camera system;continuous online estimation;planar roads;continuous stereo self-calibration","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The latter allows the car to properly position itself within the road lanes, which is also crucial for any subsequent lane departure or trajectory planning decision in fully autonomous cars. Traditional lane detection methods rely on a combination of highly-specialized, hand-crafted features and heuristics, usually followed by post-processing techniques, that are computationally expensive and prone to scalability due to road scene variations. More recent approaches leverage deep learning models, trained for pixel-wise lane segmentation, even when no markings are present in the image due to their big receptive field. Despite their advantages, these methods are limited to detecting a pre-defined, fixed number of lanes, e.g. ego-lanes, and can not cope with lane changes. In this paper, we go beyond the aforementioned limitations and propose to cast the lane detection problem as an instance segmentation problem - in which each lane forms its own instance - that can be trained end-to-end. To parametrize the segmented lane instances before fitting the lane, we further propose to apply a learned perspective transformation, conditioned on the image, in contrast to a fixed ”bird's-eye view” transformation. By doing so, we ensure a lane fitting which is robust against road plane changes, unlike existing approaches that rely on a fixed, predefined transformation. In summary, we propose a fast lane detection algorithm, running at 50 fps, which can handle a variable number of lanes and cope with lane changes. We verify our method on the tuSimple dataset and achieve competitive results.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500547","","Image segmentation;Roads;Automobiles;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Neural networks;Pipelines","driver information systems;edge detection;feature extraction;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;road traffic;road vehicles","road lanes;post-processing techniques;road scene variations;pixel-wise lane segmentation;lane detection problem;lane fitting;fast lane detection algorithm;instance segmentation approach","","2","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Local trajectory models are necessary to cope with the multi-modality of such structures, which in turn introduces new challenges. These larger and more complex environments increase the occurrences of lack of motion and self-overlaps in observed trajectories which impose further challenges. In this paper we consider the problem of motion pattern recognition in the setting of sequential local motion pattern models. That is, classifying sub-trajectories from observed trajectories in accordance with which motion pattern that best explains it. We introduce a Gaussian process (GP) based modeling approach which outperforms the state-of-the-art GP based motion pattern approaches at this task. We investigate the impact of varying local model overlap and the length of the observed trajectory trace on the classification quality.

The model-free characteristics of reinforcement learning free us from hand-encoding complex policies. However, for real world tasks such as autonomous driving, there are some complex sequential decision making processes that contain distinct behaviors. Due to the delayed rewards and the averaged gradient, it is pretty difficult for a flat deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a good policy. In this paper, we design a hierarchical neural network policy and propose a hierarchical policy gradient method to train the network with the semi markov decision process (SMDP) temporal abstraction formulation. We apply this method to a traffic light passing scenario in autonomous driving, where the vehicle has two distinct behaviors (e.g., pass and stop) and its primitive actions (e.g., acceleration) should follow the corresponding behavior.

"Task Period Selection for Engagement Control of Automatic Clutches","X. Cheng; C. Cheng; L.

The previous studies provide control algorithms in continuous time-domain, but ignore the performance degradation due to discretization. In order to select an appropriate task period on engagement quality, this paper analyzes the friction-involved clutch engagement dynamics in discrete domain. Models of a closed-loop control system are developed. The models consist of the powertrain with a clutch element, the clutch actuator with time delay, the classical control algorithm combining a feedback and feed-forward link, and a zero-order holder of the task period. After discretization by z-transform, the stability is analyzed, thereafter, the maximum permissible task period, which is 0.3s for the studied system, is determined in terms of stability. Furthermore, the dynamic response is tested in a dSPACE real-time environment. The results show that the maximum vehicle jerk increases rapidly when the task period falls into the unstable region, and the friction loss ceaselessly increases due to the failed synchronization. On the other hand, when the task period falls into the stable area, basically, shorter period gains less vehiclejerk, and the friction loss can be almost the same as that of the continuous system.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500412","","Task analysis;Torque;Friction;Vehicle dynamics;Stability analysis;Mechanical power transmission;Mathematical model","actuators;closed loop systems;clutches;continuous time systems;feedback;feedforward;friction;power transmission (mechanical)","task period selection;engagement control;automatic clutches;electronically controlled clutches;continuous time-domain;friction-involved clutch engagement dynamics;discrete domain;closed-loop control system;clutch element;clutch actuator;maximum permissible task period;control algorithm;feedback link;feed-forward link;powertrain;time 0.3 s","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different from level 3 of driving automation which is supposed to issue Request to Intervene (RTI) to the driver whenever system limitations, an RTI may not be issued by the level 2 system because it is possible that the level 2 system fails to detect a hazard or understand the situation accurately which system cannot deal with. Under level 2, a driver therefore needs to understand the situation accurately and intervene in driving operation when necessary. This study focuses on whether explanation on the traffic scenes where the driving automation system may fail to detect a hazard has an impact on driver intervention or not. An experiment is conducted with a driving simulator (DS) in which the host vehicle is equipped with a driving automation system at level 2. A between-participants design is employed in our experiment. We have 30 participants, half of them are explained the possible traffic scenes and the other half are not. The participants are expected to find out the hazard which the system cannot detect a hazard by itself and to intervene in driving operation. The results show that drivers who were explained the possible scenes can deal well when the automation fails. According to the results, it may be claimed that it is necessary for car makers/dealers to explain to drivers on possible scenes where the driving automation system may fail to detect a hazard.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500521","","Vehicles;Automation;Hazards;Accidents;Task analysis;Human factors;Monitoring","automobile industry;automobiles;automotive engineering;driver information systems;road safety;traffic engineering computing","hazard detection failure;driver intervention;partial driving automation;level 2 system;driving operation;driving automation system;driving simulator;traffic scenes;society of automotive engineers;request to intervene;between-participants design","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By combining MHIs with a ResNet classifier and performing a frame by frame classification of the MHIs, we are able to detect starting motions in image sequences. The detection is performed using a wide angle stereo camera system at an urban intersection. We compare our algorithm to an existing method to detect movement transitions of pedestrians that uses MHIs in combination with a Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) like descriptor and a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we adapted to cyclists. To train and evaluate the methods a dataset containing MHIs of 394 cyclist starting motions was created. The results show that both methods can be used to detect starting motions of cyclists. Using the SVM approach, we were able to safely detect starting motions 0.506 s on average after the bicycle starts moving with an F<sub>1</sub>-score of 97.7%.

Under normal circumstances, due to the complex road environment and changing backgrounds, millimeter wave radar has more interference when detecting targets. In addition to the variety of targets in the road and the different scattering intensity of multiple parts, the interference of the flicker noise on the radar must be considered. The combination of these noises can affect the accuracy of radar measurement and even make the radar to lose the target for a short time. The paper constructs a target tracking model based on adaptive Sage-Husa Kalman filter algorithm to track radar signals. The algorithm can not only estimate the real-time state of the system, but also estimate and modify the parameters of the system and the statistical parameters of the noise, so that the system model is closer to the current real state of the system, thus improving the accuracy of the target tracking. Even if radar loses its target in a short time, the target tracking model can estimate the approximate value of the true value of the target. The experimental results show that this method can track the radar target accurately and estimate the position information of the lost target.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500505","","Target tracking;Radar tracking;Kalman filters;1f noise;Millimeter wave radar","adaptive Kalman filters;millimetre wave radar;radar tracking;target tracking;tracking filters","cattering intensity;adaptive Sage-Husa Kalman filter algorithm;radar measurement;flicker noise;complex road environment;important research direction;intelligent transportation industry;continuous development;adaptive Kalman filter;millimeter wave radar target tracking;lost target;target tracking model;short time;system model;radar signals","","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our algorithm is based on a real kinematic vehicle model; which makes it more suitable for algorithm application on real autonomous cars. Furthermore, due to the introduction of the imagination mechanism, the processing speed of our algorithm is ten times faster than that of traditional methods, permitting the realization of real-time planning simultaneously.

One major drawback using a monocular camera is that it only makes observations in the two dimensional image plane and can not directly measure the distance to objects. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by developing a multi-object tracking algorithm that takes an image as input and produces trajectories of detected objects in a world coordinate system. We solve this by using a deep neural network trained to detect and estimate the distance to objects from a single input image. The detections from a sequence of images are fed in to a state-of-the art Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture tracking filter. The combination of the learned detector and the PMBM filter results in an algorithm that achieves 3D tracking using only mono-camera images as input. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated both in 3D world coordinates, and 2D image coordinates, using the publicly available KITTI object tracking dataset. The algorithm shows the ability to accurately track objects, correctly handle data associations, even when there is a big overlap of the objects in the image, and is one of the top performing algorithms on the KITTI object tracking benchmark. Furthermore, the algorithm is efficient, running on average close to 20 frames per second.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500454","","Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Radar tracking;Object tracking;Object detection;Sensors;Neural networks","cameras;feature extraction;image motion analysis;image segmentation;image sensors;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object detection;object tracking;target tracking;tracking filters","deep learning detections;monocular camera;automotive industry;autonomous vehicles;dimensional image plane;multiobject tracking algorithm;deep neural network;single input image;state-of-the art Poisson multiBernoulli mixture tracking filter;PMBM filter results;publicly available KITTI object tracking dataset;performing algorithms;KITTI object tracking benchmark;monocamera 3D multiobject tracking;monocamera images","","","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we introduce a multi-objective optimization that plans a set of trajectories using several weights and targets (e.g. desired velocity or lanes). Thus, reducing the need of extensive parameter fine-tuning and increasing the planner's capabilities to handle dynamic environments. Furthermore, in order to plan multiple trajectories in real-time, a smart-initialization of the optimization problem is introduced that speeds up the multi-objective optimization further.

However, as a module supporting decision and planning, probabilistic prediction should also be evaluated from decision and planning perspective. Moreover, the evaluation of probabilistic prediction highly relies on the problem formulation variation and motion representation simplification, which lacks a formal foundation in a comprehensive framework. To address such concerns, we provide a systematic and unified framework for the analysis of three under-explored aspects of probabilistic prediction: problem formulation, representation simplification and evaluation metric. More importantly, we address the omitted but crucial problems in the three aspects from decision and planning perspective. In addition to a review of learning metrics, metrics to be considered from planning perspective are highlighted, such as planning consequence of inaccurate and erroneous prediction, as well as violations of predicted motions to planning constraints.

In this contribution, a driving behaviors prediction model is based on a newly developed approach combining different Hidden Markov Models (HMM) cooperatively combined by Fuzzy Logic (FL). Due to variations of individual human drivers decision behavior the task to classify related behaviors based on individually trained models is difficult. The FL approach will be used for additional distinction of driving scenes into very safe, safe, and dangerous driving scenarios. For each scenario corresponding HMMs will be trained. Three different driving behaviors including left/right lane change and lane keeping are modelled as hidden states for the HMM. Based on observations, the algorithm calculates the most possible driving behaviors through the observation sequences. Furthermore, the observed sequences are also used for training of HMM during modeling process. To improve the prediction performance of the model, a prefilter is proposed to quantize the collected signals into observed sequences with specific features. To optimize the model performance NSGA-II was used to define the optimal thresholds of FL and the optimal prefilters of HMMs. Using experimental data from real human driving behaviors (taken from driving simulator) it can be concluded that selecting optimal thresholds will increase the performance of driving behaviors prediction.

These patterns are often modeled with averaged driver model. While this idea is very simple and intuitive in the context of driver classification by his/her patterns of maneuvers, our previous works demonstrated that assumptions underlying such models are often inaccurate and not applicable in general settings. In fact, it is very hard to express driving patterns with simple models. In this article we present a new way of modeling drivers: we employ Long-Short Term Memory networks to learn driver models from telematics data. In particular, our neural network models learn to predict driving-related signals, such as speed or acceleration, given the evolution of these signals up to the point of prediction. Solving this prediction task allows us to capture the behavioral model of the driver. We tested our models on several drivers, by predicting their future decisions.

Positioning is one of the key challenges in realizing AD, where global navigation systems (GNSS) is traditionally used as an important source of information. The area of GNSS are well explored and the different sources of error are deeply investigated. However the existing modeling methods often have very comprehensive requirements for the training data where all affecting conditions, such as ephemeris data and satellite clock should be well known. The main goal of this paper is to develop a solution to model GPS error that only requires information which is available in the vehicle without having access to detailed information about the conditions.

Randomly sampled nodes of a graph in a traversable region for finding a local path can generate a winding path due to connection between the randomly sampling nodes. Node sampling with constant intervals can fail to find a proper path in a case that an interval between adjacent obstacles are smaller than the sampling interval. To solve these problems, our path planner changes node sampling strategy according to obstacle positions; it samples nodes along a reference path, e.g., the center line of the lane, if there are no obstacles, but densely samples nodes around obstacles. After sampling, the planner searches the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm for finding an optimal trajectory. For efficient search for the optimal trajectory, the planner firstly generates a trajectory approximated by piecewise linear lines with minimum cost, and fine-tunes it by adjusting node positions with curved edges having smaller cost. We test the planner through simulations in which an ego vehicle drive along a reference path when there are no obstacles, and densely sample around obstacles to improve robustness against obstacle locations.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500396","","Trajectory;Roads;Windings;Shape;Lattices;Approximation algorithms","collision avoidance;graph theory;mobile robots;optimisation;sampling methods;search problems;trajectory control","local path planning;adaptive node sampling;graph search-based local path planner;winding path;randomly sampling nodes;proper path;adjacent obstacles;sampling interval;node sampling strategy;obstacle positions;samples nodes;optimal trajectory;efficient search;node positions;reference path;obstacle locations","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To humans this pedestrian intention foresight comes naturally as they are able to recognize another person's actions just by perceiving subtle changes in posture. Approximating this intention inference ability by directly training a deep neural network is useful but especially challenging. First, sufficiently large datasets for intention recognition with frame-wise human pose and intention annotations are rare and expensive to compile. Second, training on smaller datasets can lead to overfitting and make it difficult to adapt to intra-class variations in action executions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a real time framework that learns (i) intention recognition using weak-supervision and (ii) locomotion dynamics of intention from pose information using transfer learning. This new formulation is able to tackle the lack of frame-wise annotations and to learn intra-class variation in action executions.

In close-to-market development, this demand is even higher since numerous common and-more important-less common situations have to be tested and must hence be covered datawise. However, gathering the necessary amount of data ready-labeled for the task at hand is a challenge of its own. Depending on the complexity of the objective and the chosen approach, the required amount of data can be vast. At the same time, the effort to capture all possible cases of a given problem grows with their variability. This makes recording new video data unfeasible, even impossible at times. In this work, we regard parking space classification as an exemplary application to target the imbalance of cost and benefit w.r.t. image data creation for machine learning approaches. We rely on a fully-fledged park deck simulation created with Unreal Engine 4 for data creation and replace all conventionally recorded and hand-labeled training data by automatically-annotated synthetic video data.

We aim to develop a robust object detector that maintains good object detection accuracy even when the quality of the sensor signals is degraded for object detection.

Visual odometry/SLAM methods have proven capable to achieve good results, even in real-time applications by operating in a sparse mode. Running on a sequence, these methods need to continuously incorporate new features well distributed over the image. Therefore, the performance of these methods can be further improved, if they are supplied with coarse but dense initial depth information, that can be utilized at arbitrary sparse image positions. Previously triangulated depths and even high quality depth measurements of a LIDAR sensor are not suitable for this task, since they only provide a sparse depth map. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel interpolation method called Spatio-Temporal Depth Interpolation (STDI), which exploits spatial and temporal correlations of the data (e.g. sequences of sparse depth maps) to give a consistent dense output including associated uncertainties. STDI is a fused approach, which makes use of the most important components of a principal component analysis (PCA) (spatial information) and additionally is capable to re-use information of previously interpolated depth maps in a regression based approach (temporal information). We evaluate the quality of STDI on the KITTI visual odometry benchmark, where a sequence of extremely sparsely sampled depth maps (≈ 40 depth values) is densified and on the KITTI depth completion benchmark. The latter deals with the densification of sparse LIDAR input. Of course, our method is not limited to these applications and can be used for any densification of sparse sequential data which is expected to contain spatial and/or temporal correlations (e.g. initialization for dense optical flow methods based on a sparse measurement).","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500430","","Interpolation;Principal component analysis;Correlation;Uncertainty;Visualization;Laser radar;Training","distance measurement;image colour analysis;image sampling;image sensors;image sequences;interpolation;motion estimation;optical radar;principal component analysis;regression analysis;SLAM (robots);stereo image processing","Spatio-Temporal Depth Interpolation;STDI;self-localization;egomotion estimation;visual odometry/SLAM methods;sparse mode;arbitrary sparse image positions;high quality depth measurements;sparse depth map;spatial correlations;temporal correlations;principal component analysis;spatial information;interpolated depth maps;temporal information;KITTI visual odometry benchmark;extremely sparsely sampled depth maps;KITTI depth completion benchmark;sparse LIDAR input;sparse sequential data;dense optical flow methods;sparse measurement;interpolation method;depth values;consistent dense output;coarse dense initial depth information","","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It extends the range of use of state-of-the-art numerical optimal control tools to problem classes where these tools have previously not been applicable. Today these problems are typically solved using motion planners based on randomized or graph search. The general principle is to define a homotopy that transforms, or preferably relaxes, the original problem to an easily solved problem. In this work, it is shown that by combining a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method with a homotopy approach that gradually transforms the problem from a relaxed one to the original one, practically relevant locally optimal solutions to the motion planning problem can be computed. The approach is demonstrated in motion planning problems in challenging 2D and 3D environments, where the presented method significantly outperforms both a state-of-the-art numerical optimal control method and a state-of-the-art open-source optimizing sampling-based planner commonly used as benchmark.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500644","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500644","","Optimal control;Planning;Trajectory;Heuristic algorithms;Newton method;Tools;Search problems","concave programming;graph theory;mobile robots;optimal control;path planning;quadratic programming","motion planning problem;numerical optimal control techniques;motion planners;homotopy approach;sequential quadratic programming method;locally optimal solutions;open-source optimizing sampling-based planner;numerical optimal control method;2D environments;3D environments;nonconvex environments;graph search","","","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, monocular depth estimation is interesting from a practical point of view, since using a single camera is cheaper than many other options and avoids the need for continuous calibration strategies as required by stereo-vision approaches. State-of-the-art methods for monocular depth estimation are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A promising line of work consists of introducing additional semantic information about the traffic scene when training CNNs for depth estimation. In practice, this means that the depth data used for CNN training is complemented with images having pixelwise semantic labels, which usually are difficult to annotate (e.g. crowded urban images). Moreover, so far it is common practice to assume that the same raw training data is associated with both types of ground truth, i.e., depth and semantic labels. The main contribution of this paper is to show that this hard constraint can be circumvented, i.e., that we can train CNNs for depth estimation by leveraging the depth and semantic information coming from heterogeneous datasets. In order to illustrate the benefits of our approach, we combine KITTI depth and Cityscapes semantic segmentation datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500683","","Semantics;Estimation;Training;Cameras;Laser radar;Image segmentation;Testing","calibration;cameras;driver information systems;feedforward neural nets;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);stereo image processing","semantic information;convolutional neural networks;KITTI depth;depth data;particular depth estimation;heterogeneous datasets;monocular depth estimation","","","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A Compact Map Representation for Large-scale Environments and Localization Method based on Similarity Measure","K. Matsuzaki; H.

State-of-the-art compact map representations distinguish partial-objects such as lane markings from whole-object data. However, they require that objects are correctly detected in both map generation and localization. Therefore, the localization may fail if either of these conditions is violated due to occlusion, poor road texture, or other complications. In this paper, we propose a novel map generation and localization method that uses whole-object data without object detection. The novel map so produced has compactness comparable to state-of-the-art methods involving object detection because it is described as blocks of quantized representation in a voxel grid. In the localization step, we formulate localization as a similarity search between the map data and differently sampled sensor data. The proposed localization method performs the search at a sub-voxel level while alleviating voxel discretization error. This enables accurate localization even with low-resolution voxels. Experiments show the proposed method achieves sufficient localization accuracy and real-time processing with a map having a data size of 32 kB per km. The storage efficiency is at least 161 times greater than state-of-the-art maps covering the same area.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500613","","Roads;Object detection;Data models;Lighting;Three-dimensional displays;Laser radar;Measurement by laser beam","feature extraction;image representation;image resolution;object detection","whole-object data;object detection;state-of-the-art methods;localization step;map data;sensor data;localization method;real-time processing;state-of-the-art compact map representations;map generation","","","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These algorithms are usually trained on large datasets consisting of thousands or millions of labeled training examples. While large datasets have been published regarding cars, for cyclists very few labeled data is available although appearance, point of view, and positioning of even relevant objects differ. Unfortunately, labeling data is costly and requires a huge amount of work. In this paper, we thus address the problem of learning with very few labels. The aim is to recognize particular traffic signs in crowdsourced data to collect information which is of interest to cyclists. We propose a system for object recognition that is trained with only 15 examples per class on average. To achieve this, we combine the advantages of convolutional neural networks and random forests to learn a patch-wise classifier. In the next step, we map the random forest to a neural network and transform the classifier to a fully convolutional network. Thereby, the processing of full images is significantly accelerated and bounding boxes can be predicted. Finally, we integrate data of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to localize the predictions on the map. In comparison to Faster R-CNN and other networks for object recognition or algorithms for transfer learning, we considerably reduce the required amount of labeled data.

Our object level approach is inspired by recent advances in two independent object-region proposal techniques: supervised object proposal (e.g., YOLO) and unsupervised object proposal (e.g., BING). A difficulty arises from the fact that even state-of-the-art object proposal techniques suffer from misdetections and false alarms.

With the decreasing of the fixed new block reward, transaction fees will play the role as the main profit source of miners, thus provide important supports for the sustainability and vitality of the Bitcoin system. Therefore, it is of great necessity to research transaction fees. In this paper, we investigate transaction fees in a queuing game with non-preemptive priority, in which both the miners' mining rewards and the users' time cost are highlighted. Then, we conduct theoretical analysis of the game, getting five types of Nash equilibria of the game.

The risk analysis of wireless communication reliability is a critical issue related to operation safety. However, the fault parameters especially under cognitive uncertainties cannot always be properly estimated, not only because of the large number of redundancy design being applied in wireless communication system for the sake of reliability enhancement, but also the lack of status data collected by distributed sensors of the maintenance and management subsystem(MMS) displayed in wireless communication equipment due to the limited operation life. In this paper, based on the status data acquired by the distributed sensors from MMS, a risk analysis method is proposed using Continuous Time Bayesian Network with its key condition parameters expressed by Triangular Fuzzy Numbers. Moreover, with an expert confidence index, the credibility of the fuzzy probability evaluation for basic risk factors can be ensured, which means the limitation in risk analysis caused by cognitive uncertainties can be eliminated. The method proposed in this paper integrates together a risk analysis process with deductive reasoning, sensitivity analysis and abductive inference.

We compare four recent transforms for illumination invariant image representation, individually and with colour hybrid images, to show that despite assumptions to contrary such invariant pre-processing can improve the state of the art in scene understanding performance. In addition, we propose a robust approach based on using an illumination-invariant image representation, combined with the chromatic component of a perceptual colour-space to improve contemporary automotive scene understanding and segmentation. By using an illumination invariant pre-process, to reduce the impact of environmental illumination changes, we show that the performance of deep convolutional neural network based scene understanding and segmentation can yet be further improved. This illuminating result enforces the need for invariant (unbiased) training sets within such deep network training and shows that even a welltrained network may still not offer truly optimal performance (if we ignore any prior data transforms attributable to a priori insight).

Non-calibrated sensors result in artifacts and aberration in the environment model, which makes tasks like free-space detection more challenging. In this study, we improve the LiDAR and camera fusion approach of Levinson and Thrun. We rely on intensity discontinuities and erosion and dilation of the edge image for increased robustness against shadows and visual patterns, which is a recurring problem in point cloud related work. Furthermore, we use a gradientfree optimizer instead of an exhaustive grid search to find the extrinsic calibration. Hence, our fusion pipeline is lightweight and able to run in real-time on a computer in the car. For the detection task, we modify the Faster R-CNN architecture to accommodate hybrid LiDAR-camera data for improved object detection and classification.

With fine-tuning, the underlying assumption is that the pre-trained model extracts generic features, which are at least partially relevant for solving a segmentation task, but that would be difficult to extract from the smaller amount of data that is available for training in urban driving scenes segmentation. However, besides the initialization with the pre-trained model and the early stopping, there is no mechanism in classical fine-tuning approaches for keeping the generic features. Even worse, the standard weight decay drives the parameters towards the origin and affects the learned features.

Then, via teleoperation as a fallback solution, a human-in-the-loop can be introduced as the main decision maker. However, high delay in the communication channel distorts the performance of direct force feedback teleoperation for example in space or disaster scenarios. On the other hand, model-mediated teleoperation can provide instantaneous and even predictive force feedback to the user, but the performance is limited due to state mismatches, incomplete models, model errors and the modeling challenges of complex wheel-ground contacts. Therefore, in this paper we introduce the concept of extended model-mediated teleoperation with a car like interface for mobile robots by fusing local fictitious and remote force feedback, which can be measured, computed or fictitious. We provide a method to guarantee stability of the extended model-mediated teleoperation (involving time delay, multilateral coupling, fictitious force feedback and permanent updates of the local model) based on the passivity theorem. The benefits of the approach are highlighted by human-in-the-loop experiments with a wheeled mobile robot.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500578","model-mediated teleoperation;time delay;force feedback fusion;TDPA","Force feedback;Force;Robots;Stability analysis;Solid modeling;Computational modeling","legged locomotion;predictive control;stability;telerobotics","extended predictive model-mediated teleoperation;autonomous driving systems;direct force feedback teleoperation;local fictitious force feedback;remote force feedback;wheeled mobile robot;multilateral control","","","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Vision sensors, such as the monocular camera and stereo camera, are widely used for environment perception. The monocular camera provides the appearance information like intensity, and the stereo camera provides the depth information. The appearance and depth information are complementary, and their effective fusion would result in robust environment perception. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, termed as the ChiNet, for the effective sensor fusion of the appearance and depth information for free space and road object estimation. The ChiNet has two input branches and two output branches. The ChiNet input branches contains separate branches for the intensity and depth information. For the output branches, the ChiNet contains separate branches for the free space and road object semantic segmentation. A comparative of the proposed framework with state-of-the-art baseline algorithms is performed using an acquired dataset. Moreover, a detailed parameter analysis is performed to validate the ChiNet architecture as well as the advantages of sensor fusion. The experimental results show that the ChiNet is better than baseline algorithms. We also show that the proposed ChiNet architecture is better than other variations of the ChiNet architecture.","1931-0587","978-1-5386-4452-2978-1-5386-4451-5978-1-5386-4453","10.1109/IVS.2018.8500476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500476","","Semantics;Roads;Decoding;Cameras;Encoding;Sensor fusion;Feature extraction","computer vision;driver information systems;image fusion;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);stereo image processing","depth cues;road scenes;vision-based environment perception;autonomous driving;advanced driver assistance systems;vision sensors;monocular camera;stereo camera;appearance information;depth information;robust environment perception;effective sensor fusion;road object estimation;road object semantic segmentation;ChiNet architecture;deep learning framework","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
