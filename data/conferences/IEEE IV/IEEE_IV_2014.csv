"Computation of stable interval Kalman filter bounds for their use in robust state estimation for an uninhabited surface vehicle with bounded indeterminate system dynamics","A. Motwani; S. Sharma; R.

Interval filters become necessary when the system dynamics are not known precisely or vary unpredictably, but can nevertheless be described in terms of bounded intervals. Such filters based on interval systems require the use of interval arithmetic (IA) for their operation. One of the main limitations to such techniques is that the interval bounds of the computed filter estimates often diverge due to the overly conservative nature of IA. In this paper, ellipsoidal rather than direct IA is used to operate the IKF and obtain bounds of the interval estimates that do not diverge due to the so called wrapping effect. From these bounds, a weighted average is computed at each time-step that is close to the true system state. To obtain this weighting, an artificial neural network (ANN) is previously trained to map residuals of an ordinary Kalman filter to the optimal weights, and this trained network is then used online in new tracking missions.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856417","","Vehicles;Vehicle dynamics;Vectors;Kalman filters;Mathematical model;Equations;Artificial neural networks","estimation theory;Kalman filters;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;neural nets;state estimation;vehicle dynamics","stable interval Kalman filter bound computation;robust state estimation;uninhabited surface vehicle;bounded indeterminate system dynamics;IKF;interval estimates;wrapping effect;weighted average computation;artificial neural network training;ANN training;tracking missions","","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is the most common and accessible technique for vehicle localization. However, conventional localization techniques which mostly rely on GPS technology are not able to provide reliable positioning accuracy in all situations. This paper presents an integrated localization algorithm that exploits all possible data from different resources including GPS, radio-frequency identification, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, and dead reckoning. A localization algorithm is also introduced which only utilizes those resources that are most useful when several resources are available.

Because over 70% of the weight of goods shipped in the U.S. are trucked, substantial pavement damage is becoming more and more problematic [1]. Thus, an accurate classification system for estimating vehicle parameters is sorely needed. Currently, the most widely used classification solution consists of a combination of inductive loops and piezoelectric sensors. Installing these systems causes pavement damage. Even more challenging is that current systems greatly under-classify class 1 motorcycle vehicles. In this paper we present a novel system for classifying vehicles and determining track width and speed. The system employs a multi-element piezoelectric sensor positioned diagonally across a single traffic lane; a data acquisition unit; and a processing and classification algorithm operating on a computing device. Vehicle front axle tires distinctively impact different element sensors, which aids in calculating track width, speed and axle spacing. Given these factors, a classification decision can be made using vehicle axle spacing. The developed system was tested on highway conditions.

We do this because longitudinal lane-markings delineate the driving direction of a road and the orientations of any true, longitudinal lane-markings appearing on input images should be aligned with this direction. To approximate the driving direction of a road, we detect the vanishing point on a horizon line and draw a line to link the image coordinates of the detected vanishing point to those of the center of the image bottom.

This study aims to determine effective and reliable indications of a driver's unmasked sleepiness using driver-vehicle data. A Bayesian approach and the signal detection theory were applied to investigate the effectiveness of selected driver-vehicle parameters for this purpose. Twenty subjects participated in three consecutive driving sessions on the simulated 4-lane highway from Seoul to Cheonan, Korea, during which their PERCLOS (percentage of eye closure) data, assumed to be a true indicator of a driver's unmasked sleepiness, i.e., drowsiness, were monitored. Correlations between PERCLOS and the selected vehicle parameters, such as velocity RMSE (root-mean-square error), were analyzed while participants performed skill-based and rule-based driving tasks. The preliminary experimental results demonstrated that unmasked sleepiness, as indicated by PERCLOS, was not correlated with the selected vehicle parameters for skill-based tasks. Some rule-based tasks, such as VPVT (Visual Psychomotor Vigilance Task), showed significant correlations with masked and unmasked sleepiness, which shows that driver-vehicle data can potentially be used as a dynamic unmasked sleepiness indicator. More in-depth analysis is being conducted and is expected to be included in the final version of the manuscript.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856520","","Sleep;Vehicles;Bayes methods;Educational institutions;Automotive engineering;Monitoring;Standards","belief networks;driver information systems;mean square error methods;road safety;signal detection","visual psychomotor vigilance task;VPVT;root-mean-square error;velocity RMSE;percentage of eye closure data;PERCLOS;driver-vehicle parameters;signal detection theory;Bayesian approach;driver-vehicle data;unmasked sleepiness detection;full-scale driving simulator data","","2","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Common for most heavy vehicles is a positive scrub radius. This can result in a destabilizing steering wheel torque at front tyre blow-out. In this study the safety improvement achieved when reducing scrub radius is quantified. By using a heavy truck equipped with a modified electric power steering system it was possible to change the scrub radius virtually. Brakes were configured to emulate front tyre blow-out which appeared as a sudden disturbance on one of the front tyres. In total 20 drivers took part in the study which was run on a test track at 50 km/h. Results show that the produced average lateral deviation from the original direction was 23 cm, when scrub radius was 12 cm, compared to 16 cm, when scrub radius was 0 cm. The main cause of the observed difference was a small, yet significant, initial overshoot in steering wheel angle which can be derived from the destabilizing steering wheel torque.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856544","","Vehicles;Tires;Torque;Wheels;Axles;Trajectory;Roads","human factors;road accidents;road safety;road vehicles;steering systems;tyres","driver response;front tyre failures;steering wheel angle;brakes;electric power steering system;heavy truck;safety improvement;steering wheel torque;fatal accidents;scrub radius;heavy vehicles","","","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, we put forward an online passenger counting framework which is based on feature-points tracking and can be easily deployed to different scenarios. The method works even in low illumination conditions as demonstrated in experiments. Second, vehicle running information was combined to improve the accuracy of passenger counting. The transit vehicle settings are unconstrained and complex due to variations from illumination, movement and uncontrolled passenger behaviors. We tackle this by incorporating different modalities besides videos such as the status of the vehicle (e.g., in motion or not).

Each switching state captures object dynamics as a mean motion with variance, but also has an additional spatial distribution on where the dynamic is seen relative to the vehicle. Thus, both an object's previous movements and current location will make certain dynamics more probable for subsequent time steps. To train the model, we use Bayesian inference to sample parameters from the posterior, and jointly learn the required number of dynamics. Unlike Maximum Likelihood learning, inference is robust against overfitting and poor initialization.

The main task of the proposed algorithms is to calculate an energy optimal trajectory in a real-time capable way.

The vehicle control of magnetic guidance, however, is difficult because of the look-down property of road detecting sensors. This paper proposes a curvature map based approach to realize look-ahead control for magnetic guidance used in urban scenarios. The basis of the approach is a magnet tracking algorithm, which makes it possible to calculate the curvature of the passed road. The tracking algorithm is used not only to localize the vehicle but also to build the curvature map of the reference trajectory. Once the magnetic ruler detects a magnet, a magnet tracker is initialized and tracks the magnet in the vehicle coordinate. Then these tracking results combined with the curvature map are used to predict the upcoming road's curvature. The curvature map is obtained by running the tracking algorithm when the vehicle is driving along the magnetic trajectory by hand. Compared with existing methods, the algorithm predominates in implementation and robustness. Experiments on real application scenario have verified the effectiveness of the proposed idea.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856603","","Vehicles;Nails;Roads;Mathematical model;Trajectory;Equations;Prediction algorithms","magnets;remotely operated vehicles;road vehicles;tracking","autonomous vehicle navigation;urban scenarios;roadway magnets;magnetic guidance;vehicle control;look-down property;road detecting sensors;curvature map based approach;look-ahead control;magnet tracking algorithm;curvature calculation;vehicle localization;reference trajectory;magnetic ruler;magnet detection;magnet tracker;upcoming road curvature prediction","","1","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Motion cues are extracted from the scene, and leveraging the epipolar geometry of the monocular setup, motion compensation is performed.

Accuracy assessment of AVCs is thus important to ensure proper VMT reporting. Studying the accuracy of AVC devices is therefore essential. Previous studies employed either manual counting or a “play and pause” method of traffic video recording to verify the accuracy of AVC devices. This paper details a custom vision-aided software developed to aid in extracting accurate vehicle count and classification information used as ground truth data.

At the same time governments around the world are encouraging people to buy electric vehicles. This paper proposes the creation of electric vehicle enhanced dedicated bus lanes (E-DBL), by allowing electric vehicles access to bus lanes, in order to improve the use of road capacity. By opening bus lanes to electric vehicles, traffic congestion could be eased, the range of electric vehicles could be extended, and the travel times for electric vehicle owners could be reduced significantly. The paper shows how by introducing E-DBLs, the bus journey times are not significantly affected given the current uptake of electric vehicles in most developed countries. This paper presents extensive simulations based on traffic situation in the city of Dublin with regard to the effect of opening up bus lanes to electric vehicles. The results show that even with very high percentages of electric vehicles the bus journey times are not noticeably affected. Opening up bus lanes to electric vehicles can even be beneficial for other road users by reducing congestion on regular lanes, which would further reduce carbon emissions.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856418","Electric Vehicles;Dedicated Bus Lanes;Smart Cities","Roads;Electric vehicles;Ice;Cities and towns;Fuels;Carbon dioxide","air pollution control;electric vehicles;road traffic","carbon emission reduction;electric vehicle enhanced dedicated bus lanes;E-DBL;road capacity;traffic congestion;bus journey times;Dublin;congestion reduction","","2","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Experiences from implementing the ETSI ITS SecuredMessage service","N. Nowdehi; T.

The aim of this paper is to share our experiences from implementing the ETSI Intelligent Transport System (ITS) SecuredMessage and sign/verify services on an existing ETSI ITS communication stack (ITSC). We have followed the new ETSI TS 103 097 v1.1.1 standard when implementing the security services, and have made our best to create a robust and secure implementation. Our goal has been to identify flaws and vulnerabilities in our implementation that are caused by weaknesses or deficiencies in the standard and in its description of services. We have then performed an analysis of the protocol, its headers and created test cases used to test our implementation. Several problems were found, and we have also repeated the tests with another, supposedly very stable implementation, provided by Fraunhofer FOKUS. To our surprise, this system also showed unexpected behavior as our system. We show that these problems are the result of weaknesses and complexities in the design of the standard. We present the problems found in our implementation and show what part in the standard was causing the problems. We show that several problems in the standard, mainly due to their complexity, open up for misinterpretation leading to various types of implementation errors. We conclude the paper with proposing changes to the standard to prevent other implementations from repeating the same mistakes.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856587","","Payloads;Telecommunication standards;Security;Vehicles;Protocols;Computer aided manufacturing","intelligent transportation systems;security of data","ETSI ITS SecuredMessage service;cooperative intelligent transport systems;vehicle to vehicle communcication security;vehicle to infrastructure communication security;ETSI intelligent transport system SecuredMessage;sign/verify services;ETSI ITS communication stack;ITSC;ETSI TS 103 097 v1.1.1 standard;flaw identification;vulnerability identification;Fraunhofer FOKUS","","3","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Heavy-duty vehicle drivers are aware this fact and sometimes drive close to other heavy-duty vehicles. However, it is not currently well known how many vehicles are actually driving in such spontaneous platoons today. This paper studies the platooning rate of 1,800 heavy-duty vehicles by analyzing sparse vehicle position data from a region in Europe during one day. Map-matching and path-inference algorithms are used to determine which paths the vehicles took. The spontaneous platooning rate is found to be 1.2 %, which corresponds to a total fuel saving of 0.07% compared to if none of the vehicles were platooning. Furthermore, we introduce several virtual coordination schemes. We show that coordinations can increase the platooning rate and fuel saving with a factor of ten with minor adjustments from the current travel schedule. The platooning rate and fuel savings can be significantly greater if higher flexibility is allowed.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856540","","Vehicles;Roads;Fuels;Probes;Global Positioning System;Junctions","adaptive control;aerodynamics;position control;road vehicles","sparse heavy-duty vehicle position data;vehicle platooning fuel-saving potential;heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers;aerodynamic drag reduction;Europe;map-matching algorithm;path-inference algorithm;fleet management system;adaptive cruise control","","13","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The decision on how to split the braking torque among the friction brake and the electric motor is one of the main issues of such hybrid braking systems. With this challenge in mind, a new model predictive control allocation (MPCA) approach for hybrid braking is proposed. In comparison to state of the art torque blending solutions (daisy chain and dynamic control allocation) the MPCA offers faster transient response, without compromising the energy recuperation efficiency of the actuators. In addition, we also develop a linear wheel slip controller to regulate the braking force during emergency braking maneuvers. The tuning of this wheel slip controller is carried out using robust pole placement techniques, which ensures good operation in spite of uncertainties in the tire-road friction coefficient and the vertical load.

Because of the highly dynamic VANET topology and the short transmission range mandated for Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) by Federal Communications Commission (FCC), communication links among vehicles are short-lived especially in sparse vehicular density, making the task of establishing (through connection setup process) and maintaining the communications for fast-moving vehicles difficult. Furthermore, when a fixed transmission range is used in dynamically changing VANET, network could be easily suffered by a “broadcast-storm” in dense vehicular density while vehicles in VANET could be disconnected frequently in sparse vehicular density. In addition, when communication channels are overcrowded in VANET, vehicles should be able to switch from one radio frequency (RF) bands to another to make robust communication using spectrum-agile wireless environment. In this paper, we study the connectivity for spectrum-agile VANET in fading channels. Specifically, connectivity enhancement for vehicle-to-vehicle communications for vehicles traveling in opposite directions and for vehicles traveling in same direction is investigated using mathematical analysis and simulation results.

In particular, we present algorithms to gather the necessary data from unknown scenes and to subsequently estimate the camera parameters. These do rely on vehicle odometry only to resolve the focal scale ambiguity and to recognize when a purely translational motion is performed. We pay special attention to noise handling and circumvention of numerical instabilities. The proposed pipeline is tested by means of simulations to examine its noise sensitivity.

The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been compared with measurement results for the following three cycles: motor vehicle expert group (MVEG-95), European driving cycle (ECE), and extra-urban driving cycle (EUDC). For eco-routing, experiments show that there are tradeoffs between fuel savings and travel time. Results reported in this paper show that up to 33 % of fuel savings have been achieved at the expense of 3 % increase in trip-time.

In the second step, a set of terminal states are sampled aligned with the refined reference path. Then, to satisfy system constraints, a model predictive path generation method is utilized to generate multiple path candidates, which connect the current vehicle state with the sampling terminal states. Simultaneously the velocity profiles are assigned to guarantee safe and comfort driving motions.

This has severe negative effects, including drivers stress due to increased time pressure, reduced usage efficiency of trucks and other commercial vehicles, and increased gas emissions-responsible for climate change and air pollution affecting population health in densely populated areas. As existing centralized approaches were neither efficient, nor scalable, there is a need for alternative approaches. Social insects provide many solutions for dealing with decentralized problems. For instance ants choose their routes based on pheromones left by previous ants. However, Ant Colony Optimization is not directly applicable to vehicle routing, as routing the vehicles to the same road would cause traffic congestion. Yet, the traffic is broadly similar from work-to work-day. This paper introduces an ant-colony optimization-based algorithm called Time-Ants. Time-Ants considers that an amount of “pheromone” or a traffic rating is assigned to each road at any given time in the day. Using an innovative algorithm the vehicle's routes are chosen based on these traffic ratings, aggregated in time. After several iterations this results in a global optimum for the traffic system. Bottlenecks are identified and avoided by machine learning. Time-Ants outperforms another leading algorithm by up to 19% in terms of percentage of vehicles to reach the destination within a given time-frame.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856444","Traffic congestion;Machine learning;Vehicle routing;VANET","Vehicles;Roads;Routing;Junctions;Load management;Heuristic algorithms;DNA","air pollution;ant colony optimisation;learning (artificial intelligence);road vehicles;traffic control;traffic engineering computing","innovative temporal ant-based vehicular routing mechanism;spatial ant-based vehicular routing mechanism;traffic congestion;trucks;commercial vehicles;gas emissions;climate change;air pollution;social insects;decentralized problems;ant colony optimization;vehicle routing;Time-Ants;pheromone;traffic rating;traffic system;machine learning","","6","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wireless communications have potential to support road safety by enabling road users to exchange information. In contrast to vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications for avoidance of inter-vehicle collisions, very limited efforts are made on communication mechanisms for pedestrian safety. This paper addresses the issue in a concrete way. We first formulate the requirement of the minimum information exchange distance for providing road users to have the necessary amount of time to perceive the situation and react. We then report our field tests and measurement based analysis to investigate if a Wi-Fi system can satisfy the application requirement. We also introduce a pedestrian protection application, V2ProVu, which provides the functionalities of the Wi-Fi communications, risk calculation, and hazard alarming. Our study discloses several useful insights including 1) information exchange for a velocity of 80 km/h has to be made before vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) distance is below 72 meters and 2) while this requirement is not too hard for radio communications technologies, the V2P communication range is greatly reduced if the signal is blocked by a human body.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856553","","Vehicles;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Global Positioning System;Roads;Safety;Delays;Accuracy","collision avoidance;hazards;pedestrians;risk management;road safety;wireless LAN","vehicle to pedestrian communications;vulnerable road user protection;pedestrian collision;wireless communications;road safety;intervehicle collision avoidance;pedestrian safety;Wi-Fi system;pedestrian protection application;V2ProVu;risk calculation;hazard alarming;information exchange;radio communications technologies","","34","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to that, based on the prediction of the future vehicle motion, this algorithm compensates for a significant actuator time delay.

However, real environments present several challenges like illumination changes and varying weather conditions. We propose a multi-modal road detection and segmentation method based on monocular images and HD multi-layer LIDAR data (3D point cloud). This algorithm consists of three stages: extraction of ground points from multilayer LIDAR, transformation of color camera information to an illumination-invariant representation, and lastly the segmentation of the road area. For the first module, the core function is to extract the ground points from LIDAR data. To this end a road boundary detection is performed based on histogram analysis, then a plane estimation using RANSAC, and a ground point extraction according to the point-to-plane distance. In the second module, an image representation of illumination-invariant features is computed simultaneously. Ground points are projected to image plane and then used to compute a road probability map using a Gaussian model. The combination of these modalities improves the robustness of the whole system and reduces the overall computational time, since the first two modules can be run in parallel. Quantitative experiments carried on the public KITTI dataset enhanced by road annotations confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856466","multi-modal perception;monocular vision;LI-DAR;Intelligent Vehicle;road detection","Roads;Laser radar;Histograms;High definition video;Cameras;Vehicles;Estimation","feature extraction;Gaussian processes;image colour analysis;image representation;image segmentation;image sensors;lighting;object detection;optical radar;traffic engineering computing","multimodal system;road detection;road segmentation;modern intelligent vehicles;perception functions;illumination changes;varying weather conditions;monocular images;HD multilayer LIDAR data;ground points extraction;color camera information;illumination-invariant representation;road boundary detection;histogram analysis;RANSAC;ground point extraction;image representation;illumination-invariant features;road probability map;Gaussian model;public KITTI dataset;road annotations","","15","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a system may assist the driver by monitoring the driver or vehicle behaviors to predict/detect driving situations (e.g, lane departure) and alert the driver to take corrective action. In this paper, we show how the support vector machine (SVM) methodology can potentially provide enhanced unintentional lane departure prediction, which is a new method relative to literature. Our binary SVM employed the Radial Basis Function kernel to classify time series of select vehicle variables. The SVM was trained and tested using the driver experiment data generated by VIRTTEX, a hydraulically powered 6-degrees-of-freedom moving base driving simulator at Ford Motor Company. The data that we used represented 16 drowsy subjects (three-hour driving time per subject) and six control subjects (20 minutes driving per subject), all of which drove a simulated 2000 Volvo S80. The vehicle variables were all sampled at 50 Hz. There were a total of 3,508 unintentional lane departure occurrences for the drowsy drivers and only 23 for four of the six control drivers (two had none). The SVM was trained by over 60,000 time series examples (the actual number depended on the prediction horizon) created from 50% of the lane departures. The training data were removed from the testing data. During the testing, the SVM made a lane departure prediction at every sampling time for every one of the 22 drivers (over 6.8 million predictions in total). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the SVM with a 0.2-second prediction horizon for the 22 drivers were 99.77465% and 99.99997%, respectively. The SVM predicted, on average 0.200181 seconds in advance, lane departure correctly for all the control drivers, but missed 4 of the 1,758 and gave false positives for another 2 for the drowsy drivers. For the prediction horizon of 0.4s, there was 1 false positive case for the control subjects, and the false negative and false positive cases rose substantially to 10 and 137 for the drowsy drivers, respectively.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856602","","Vehicles;Support vector machines;Kernel;Training;Time series analysis;Testing;Roads","behavioural sciences computing;control engineering computing;driver information systems;pattern classification;radial basis function networks;road vehicles;support vector machines;time series","support vector machine approach;unintentional vehicle lane departure prediction;advanced driver assistance system;unintentional lane departure warning system;R & D effort;support vector machine methodology;SVM methodology;binary SVM;radial basis function kernel;time series classification;driver experiment data;VIRTTEX;hydraulically powered 6-degrees-of-freedom moving base driving simulator;Ford Motor Company;drowsy drivers;prediction horizon;control driver;false positive","","3","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, no matter what kind of model structure and expression form are applied, the current method of driver characteristics analysis only considers the driving state of preceding vehicle in the host lane, neglecting the driving state of vehicles in the adjacent lane. Based on experimental data from real-road tests, the traditional analysis of host-lane driving characteristics has many limitations. To address the uncertainty of drivers' behaviour, Grey System Theory is introduced, and the described method of car-following behaviour in multilane driving is established to analyse the difference when following a host-lane vehicle versus following an adjacent-lane vehicle. Results show that traditional car-following behaviour analysis is only applicable when the host-lane preceding vehicle has a small headway. When it is long distance, a driver's risk perception is subject to the combined effects of multiple preceding vehicles. Preliminary research into car-following behaviour in multilane situations shows that the result of multilane analysis is not entirely consistent with that of single-lane analysis, which indicates that it is necessary to explore drivers' behaviour rules in multilane driving to improve both adaptability and acceptability of current advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856494","","Vehicles;Mathematical model;Roads;Adaptation models;Correlation;Radar imaging","automobiles;driver information systems;grey systems","driver car-following correlative behavior;multilane driving;driver behaviour modelling;driver behaviour analysis;advanced driver assistance systems;ADAS;driver characteristics analysis;host-lane driving characteristics analysis;grey system theory;adjacent-lane vehicle;host-lane preceding vehicle;driver risk perception;single-lane analysis","","3","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Hybrid sampling Bayesian Occupancy Filter","A. Nègre; L. Rummelhard; C. Laugier","CNRS, LIG; Inria, e-Motion; Inria, e-Motion","2014 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium Proceedings","","2014","","","1307","1312","Modeling and monitoring dynamic environments is a complex task but is crucial in the field of intelligent vehicle. A traditional way of addressing these issues is the modeling of moving objects, through Detection And Tracking of Moving Objects (DATMO) methods. An alternative to a classic object model framework is the occupancy grid filtering domain. Instead of segmenting the scene into objects and track them, the environment is represented as a regular grid of occupancy, in which each cell is tracked at a sub-object level. The Bayesian Occupancy Filter [1] is a generic occupancy grid framework which predicts the spread of spatial occupancy by estimating cell velocity distributions. However its velocity model, corresponding to a transition histogram per cell, leads to huge data management which in practice makes it hardly compatible to severe computational and hardware constraints, like in many embedded systems. In this paper, we present a new representation for the BOF, describing the environment through a mix of static and dynamic occupancy. This differentiation enables the use of a model adapted to the considered nature: static occupancy is described in a classic occupancy grid, while dynamic occupancy is modeled by a set of moving particles. Both static and dynamic parts are jointly generated and evaluated, their distribution over the cells being adjusted. This approach leads to a more compact model and to drastically improve the accuracy of the results, in particular in term of velocities. Experimental results show that the number of values required to model the velocities have been reduced from a typical 900 per cell (for a 30×30 neighborhood) to less than 2 per cell in average. The massive data compression allows to plan dedicated embedded devices.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856554","","Vehicle dynamics;Bayes methods;Vehicles;Histograms;Dynamics;Mathematical model;Road transportation","data compression;embedded systems;filtering theory;object detection;object tracking;remotely operated vehicles;sampling methods","hybrid sampling Bayesian occupancy filter;intelligent vehicle;DATMO method;detection and tracking of moving objects;object model framework;occupancy grid filtering domain;cell velocity distributions;embedded systems;data compression;embedded devices","","24","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional solution of GPS localization is often unreliable in urban environments where tall buildings can cause shadowing of the satellite signal and multipath propagation. Typical visual feature based localization methods rely on calculation of the fundamental matrix which can be unstable when the baseline is small. In this paper we propose a novel method which uses the scale of matched SURF image features and Dynamic Time Warping to perform stable localization. By comparing SURF feature scales between input images and a pre-constructed database, stable localization is achieved without the need to calculate the fundamental matrix. In addition, 3D information is added to the database feature points in order to perform lateral localization, and therefore lane recognition. From experimental data captured from real traffic environments, we show how the proposed system can provide high localization accuracy relative to an image database, and can also perform lateral localization to recognize the vehicle's current lane.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856545","","Databases;Vehicles;Cameras;Feature extraction;Image recognition;Three-dimensional displays;Accuracy","cameras;driver information systems;image matching","single camera vehicle localization;SURF scale warping;dynamic time warping;vehicle ego-localization;driver assistance system;autonomous driving system;GPS localization;satellite signal;multipath propagation;visual feature based localization methods;fundamental matrix;SURF image feature matching;lateral localization;image database;vehicle current lane recognition","","6","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within each candidate field, we then characterize the level of threat, to influence autonomous navigation or driver support inputs. To characterize threat, the fields of safe travel are associated with sets of feasible trajectories generated from a lattice sampled in the vehicle's input space.

In our algorithm, the mean shift algorithm is utilized to determine the candidate target region, and then a judgment on the tracking effect is made according to the Bhattacharyya coefficient. If tracking fails, the candidate area is matched with the target model by SIFT feature, and a new track position is determined. Otherwise, the target model is periodically updated by SIFT feature matching, and the target model can be constantly updated according to the state change of the moving vehicle. In the scenes of moving vehicle target deformations, such as the variation of scale and illumination, the algorithm is tested and compared with other algorithms.

It is particularly useful for path planning and safe navigation. Another important task that can benefit from curb detection is localization, which is also a major requirement for self-driving cars. There are several approaches for identifying curbs using stereo cameras and 2D LIDARs in the literature. Stereo cameras depend on image pair matching methods to obtain depth information. Although 2D LIDARs being able to directly return this information, only few curb points can be detected using this sensor. In this work we propose the use of a 3D LIDAR which provides a dense point cloud and thus make possible to detect a larger extent of the curb. Our approach introduces the use of robust regression method named least trimmed squares (LTS) to deal with occluding scenes in contrast of temporal filters and spline fitting methods. We also used the curb detector as an input of a Monte Carlo localization algorithm, which is capable to estimate the pose of the vehicle without an accurate GPS sensor. We conducted experiments in urban environments to validate both the curb detector and the localization algorithm.

The high mobility of vehicles results in rapid changes in network topology generating dynamic variation in network connectivity. Therefore, a new approach of using Exponential Random Geometric Graphs (ERGGs) to analyze VANETs connectivity is presented considering the high randomness of vehicles' velocity and headway under the scenario of free flow state on highway. Vehicles enter the highway according to a Poisson distribution, and the headway follows a negative exponential distribution. Assuming that each vehicle is assigned a random speed chosen from normal distribution and maintains the speed while it travels on the highway. The dynamic topology properties, such as one-step transition probability matrix, are derived from ERGGs by analyzing the evolving process of the headway. In addition, the static topology properties such as connectivity probability and communication duration between vehicles are also calculated. The analysis of results agrees with a idealized scenario, which shows the ERGGs can be used to analyze the evolution of network connectivity.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856464","Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs);network connectivity;Exponential Random Geometric Graphs (ERGGs);dynamic variation of connectivity","Vehicles;Road transportation;Network topology;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Vehicle dynamics;Topology;Mobile computing","exponential distribution;geometry;graph theory;Poisson distribution;road traffic;road vehicles;telecommunication network topology;vehicular ad hoc networks","network connectivity analysis;vehicular ad hoc network;exponential random geometric graphs;VANET;real traffic systems;network topology;ERGG;road vehicles;Poisson distribution;negative exponential distribution","","6","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The five-year project started in 2008 aimed at energy saving and global warming prevention with automated driving. A platoon of three fully-automated heavy trucks and also a fully-automated light truck drove at 80 km/h with the gap of up to 4.7 m on a test truck. The lateral control was based on the lane marker detection by computer vision, and the longitudinal control was based on gap measurement by 76 GHz radar and lidar in addition to the inter-vehicle communications of 5.8 GHz DSRC and infrared. The radar and lidar also worked as the obstacle detection. The feature of the technologies is high reliability. Fuel consumption measurement on a test track shows that the fuel can be saved by about 15 % when the gap was 4.7 m. A simulation study shows that the effectiveness of the platooning with the gap of 10 m when the 40 % penetration in heavy trucks is 2.1 % reduction of CO2 along an expressway. In addition, experiments of four heavy trucks with CACC were also conducted for the introduction scenario. The technological and non-technological issues on automated driving and its introduction are also discussed.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856400","","Vehicles;Sensors;Safety;Reliability;Fuels;Control systems;Laser radar","computer vision;control engineering computing;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic control;road vehicles","automated truck platoon;intelligent transportation systems;energy ITS project;energy saving;global warming prevention;automated driving;lateral control;computer vision;longitudinal control;gap measurement","","13","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are not able to draw on information of previous trips because currently a memory function in production vehicles does not exist. Learning systems for vehicles were proposed to aggregate information gathered by driving routes multiple times. This information can be used to create a learning map and enable highly automated driving. Learned information can represent a certain state of the environment captured by sensors like speed limits or geo-positions of roadworks. Changes in the vehicle relevant environment will affect vehicle perception and may affect the distribution of measured variables over time. The instant where the underlying distribution of a variable changes is denoted as change point. This can invalidate parts of the acquired knowledge and was not sufficiently dealt with in previous publications in the automotive field. The ability to detect the mentioned change points is essential for the necessary ongoing update of the learning map by devaluing or removing any invalidated knowledge from memory. For this purpose we propose a statistical hypothesis test and investigate its application for a prototypic ADAS: a Curve Warning Assistance System.

Driver's coarse gaze direction or gaze zone is a very important cue in understanding driver-state. Many existing gaze zone estimators are, however, limited to single camera perspectives, which are vulnerable to occlusions of facial features from spatially large head movements away from the frontal pose. Non-frontal glances away from the driving direction, though, are of special interest as interesting events, critical to driver safety, occur during those times. In this paper, we present a distributed camera framework for gaze zone estimation using head pose dynamics to operate robustly and continuously even during large head movements. For experimental evaluations, we collected a dataset from naturalistic on-road driving in urban streets and freeways. A human expert provided the gaze zone ground truth using all vision information including eyes and surround context. Our emphasis is to understand the efficacy of the head pose dynamic information in predicting eye-gaze-based zone ground truth.

Although such restricted detectors will, as a consequence, be valid only in regions compatible with context priors, the corresponding simplification of the object-vs-background decision problem will lead to reduced computation time and/or increased detection performance. We verify this experimentally by analyzing vehicle detection performance in a realistically simulated inner-city environment where context priors are defined by a road surface mask obtained from the simulation tool. Comparing a restricted detector, based on horizontal edges detection refined by neural network confirmation, to a generic HOG+SVM-based approach which takes into account the road context prior, we show that the restricted detector shows superior vehicle detection performance at a vastly reduced computational cost.

For realizing steering-based collision avoidance, accurate environmental recognition and rapid motion planning in a highly dynamic environment are needed. The velocity potential field control method, which was proposed for mobile robot motion planning, has the advantages of a very low computation cost, even in dynamic environments with moving obstacles without any deadlock. In addition, the method generates the desired velocity vector to be followed but vehicle trajectory. With this feature, avoidance velocity vector is generated in realtime even in the case that the obstacles are moving and their movements cannot be anticipated. Thus, the present study proposes a collision avoidance method with steering control by generating a trajectory for obstacle avoidance using local environmental recognition based on application of the velocity potential field approach. In addition, a parameter determination method for the velocity potential function is derived. A preview steering control method for following the derived velocity vector is proposed. The simulation results obtained using vehicle dynamics software demonstrate that the proposed method can generate appropriate obstacle avoidance trajectories, even for moving obstacles, and the derived velocity vector can be tracked by an automobile.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856469","","Vehicles;Collision avoidance;Trajectory;Vectors;Roads;Sensors;Vehicle dynamics","collision avoidance;road safety;road traffic control;steering systems;trajectory control","collision avoidance control;velocity potential field;steering control;steering-based collision avoidance;motion planning;environmental recognition;velocity potential field control method;mobile robot motion planning;vehicle trajectory;velocity vector;parameter determination method;velocity potential function;preview steering control method;vehicle dynamics software","","6","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We basically rely on the 3D point cloud for geometrically correct virtual viewpoint images. In order to remove the holes caused by the unmeasured region of the 3D point cloud and to remove false silhouettes in surface reconstruction, we have developed a technique of free-viewpoint image generation that uses both a 3D point cloud and depth information extracted from images.

A logical next step after initial deployment will be sensor fusion to enhance actively intervening Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) with information received over C2X. As the penetration rate of equipped vehicles increases over time, higher-level CoDAS functions become feasible. In this paper we present a concept for a cooperative active blind spot assistant (CABSA) as an exemplary function of these novel Cooperative Driver Assistance Systems. As the CABSA function improves an existing ADAS function, no negative effects are observed in low-penetration scenarios. The function was implemented with messages adhering European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standards.

These car following events are of interest for designers of Forward Collision Warning (FCW) systems. This algorithm could be used in conjunction with a large scale NDS, such as the Virginia Tech Transportation Research Institute's 100-Car database, to generate population distributions of braking behavior during car following. These population distributions could be used to inform the design of warning thresholds for FCW. The heuristic algorithm developed in this study identifies car following events using forward looking radar (object range and range rate) and vehicle dynamics (speed, vehicle yaw rate).

Therefore, the detection of bidirectional loop closures when a place is revisited in a different direction provides a more robust visual navigation. We propose a novel approach for identifying bidirectional loop closures on panoramic image sequences. Our proposal combines global binary descriptors and a matching strategy based on cross-correlation of sub-panoramas, which are defined as the different parts of a panorama. A set of experiments considering several binary descriptors (ORB, BRISK, FREAK, LDB) is provided, where LDB excels as the most suitable. The proposed matching proffers a reliable bidirectional loop closure detection, which is not efficiently solved in any other previous research.

Whilst smart sensors provide information about the state of the perceived objects, considering the spatio-temporal relationships between them with respect to the subject vehicle remains a challenge. This paper proposes to fill this gap by using contextual information to infer how perceived entities are expected to behave, and thus what are the consequences of these behaviours on the subject vehicle. For this purpose, an ontology is formulated about the vehicle, perceived entities and context (map information) to provide a conceptual description of all road entities with their interaction. It allows for inferences of knowledge about the situation of the subject vehicle with respect to the environment in which it is navigating. The framework is applied to the navigation of a vehicle as it approaches road intersections, to demonstrate its applicability. Results from the real-time implementation on a vehicle operating under controlled conditions are included. They show that the proposed ontology allows for a coherent understanding of the interactions between the perceived entities and contextual data. Further, it can be used to improve the situation awareness of an ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance System), by determining which entities are the most relevant for the subject vehicle navigation.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856509","","Vehicles;Ontologies;Roads;Context;Cognition;Mobile communication;Navigation","driver information systems;inference mechanisms;ontologies (artificial intelligence);road traffic;ubiquitous computing","ontology-based context awareness;advanced driving assistance systems;vehicle driving space;smart sensors;spatio-temporal relationships;contextual information;map information;knowledge inference;vehicle navigation;road intersections;ADAS","","20","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional PHEV power management systems work in either an online or offline mode. Most online systems are based on some pre-set power balancing strategies without utilizing the driving cycle or route information. Offline management strategies solved from historical driving cycles are not optimal for real specific driving routes. With the rapid development of vehicular networks and proliferation of smartphones, real-time traffic information can be collected by smartphones from a vehicular network so as to facilitate online PHEV power management. This paper proposes an on-road PHEV power management cyber-physical system (CPS) with 2-level hierarchical optimizations to minimize the fuel consumption of a trip. The high-level online stochastic optimization generates a battery energy budget for each road at runtime according to the traffic prediction and trip information. The low-level powertrain policies are solved offline from historical driving cycles. During driving, the high-level battery energy budgets and low-level policies are combined to get the optimal power decisions according to current driving states. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other three methods in fuel savings.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856597","","Batteries;Ice;Fuels;Torque;Roads;Mechanical power transmission;Optimization","hybrid electric vehicles;optimal control;optimisation;power control;road traffic control;road vehicles","on-road PHEV power management system;hybrid electric vehicles;vehicular networks;cyber-physical system;CPS;hierarchical optimizations;fuel consumption minimization;online stochastic optimization;battery energy budget generation;road traffic prediction;powertrain policies;optimal power decisions","","1","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We also show that the total travelled distance of vehicles in this new parking lot paradigm can be 30% less than in conventional parking lots. Our proposal can have important consequences in parking costs and in urban landscape.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856561","","Space vehicles;Aerospace electronics;Mobile robots;Layout;Space exploration;Proposals","automobiles;electric propulsion;mobile robots;road traffic control;vehicular ad hoc networks","self-automated parking lots;vehicular ad hoc networking;car transportation;traffic congestion;urban landscape;park cars;mechanical parking systems;fully-autonomous vehicular technology;semi-autonomous vehicular technology;electric propulsion paradigm;parking lot controller","","9","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such systems experience significant problems in cases of GPS glitches as well as in areas without GPS coverage. Additionally, when the tracked vehicle is stationary, they cannot discriminate between traffic jams, service stations, parking lots, serious accidents and other interesting scenarios. We propose to alleviate these problems by augmenting the GPS information with a short descriptor of an image captured by an on-board camera. The descriptor allows the server to recognize various scene types by image classification and to subsequently implement suitable business policies. Due to restricted bandwidth we focus on finding a compact image representation that would still allow reliable classification. We therefore consider several state-of-the-art descriptors under tight representation budgets of 512, 256, 128 and 64 components, and evaluate classification performance on a novel image dataset specifically crafted for fleet management applications. Experimental results indicate fair performance even with very short descriptor sizes and encourage further research in the field.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856569","","Vectors;Visualization;Roads;Vehicles;Global Positioning System;Servers;Histograms","Global Positioning System;image representation;object tracking;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","image representations;traffic scene classification;restricted bandwidth scenario;fleet management systems;simple sensors;vehicle tracking;GPS information;onboard camera;image classification;business policies","","3","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, various advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) have been developed to reduce the number of traffic accidents and multiple ADASs are required to reduce further accidents. For such multiple ADASs, considering the context of driving and selecting appropriate assistance is key because the systems have to handle extremely complicated driving situations consisting of drivers (and their intents and maneuvers), environments (including other traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians), and vehicles dynamics. In this paper, time-series driving behavior is segmented into typical driving situation symbols, and the natural language expression of each situation is generated via the behavioral feature distribution observed in each situation. Owing to the symbolization of the driving behavior, the generated behavioral descriptions can be associated with their causes and results not on an actual time axis but on a situation-symbol axis as contextual descriptions, e.g., “letting up on gas pedal to pass tollgate.” The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated by using an actual data set of more than eight hours over a distance of 300 km in total. Although contextual expressions are very diverse even among human drivers, the proposed method obtained an agreement of more than 70%.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856476","","Vehicles;Pressing;Feature extraction;Wheels;Estimation;Turning;Hidden Markov models","driver information systems;natural language processing;road accidents;road traffic;time series;vehicle dynamics","contextual description;automatic translation method;time-series driving behavior;contextual information;advanced driver-assistance systems;ADASs;traffic accident reduction;vehicles dynamics;driving situation symbols;natural language expression;behavioral feature distribution;driving behavior symbolization;situation-symbol axis","","6","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of these ADAS are now active and need to be tested and evaluated before large deployment. In these ADAS, the prototyping and the implementation of the control stages are risky stages and not so easy to carry out. Indeed, the prototyping and the test of such reactive algorithms need heavy hardware and software supports (dedicated vehicle, actuators, hardware architecture, software architecture, sensors). To achieve such active devices, additional developments and implementation of numerous expensive embedded devices are required. Therefore, in order to reduce both time and risk, in early design stage, it becomes necessary to have a very realistic simulation environment dedicated to the development and to the evaluation of these ADAS. For such virtual platform, it is mandatory to provide physics-driven road environments, virtual embedded sensors, and physics-based vehicle models. In this publication, we present a dedicated couple of platforms with their efficient interconnection for the prototyping of such ADAS. Initially, the SiVIC simulation platform has been developed to generate the virtual world (environments, sensors, actuators, vehicles). In order to improve the real time prototyping capabilities of SiVIC, an efficient interconnection of this first platform has been done with RTMaps platform. This second one is mainly dedicated to the multi-sensors data processing (data management, fusion, flow recording and replaying). In this paper we will show the interest of such bi-directionnal interconnected platforms to prototype complex and real time embedded ADAS. This interconnection can be done not only on one computer but also on a distributed and distant computers architecture. The relevance of this approach will be illustrated with an automatic parking application.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856525","","Sensors;Vehicles;Software;Real-time systems;Prototypes;Computer architecture;Vehicle dynamics","automobiles;control engineering computing;control system synthesis;digital simulation;road traffic control;sensor fusion;traffic engineering computing;virtual reality","automatic car parking;advanced driver assistance systems;control stages;design stage;virtual platform;physics-driven road environments;virtual embedded sensors;physics-based vehicle models;SiVIC simulation platform;virtual world;real time prototyping capabilities;RTMaps platform;multisensors data processing;bidirectionnal interconnected platforms;real time embedded ADAS;automatic parking application","","10","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-hop broadcasting schemes are particularly preferred methods to transmit time-sensitive safety warning information to potentially influenced vehicles. However, broadcasting may lead to frequent contention and serious collision, thus causing broadcast storms. In order to alleviate broadcast storm and promptly disseminate safety warnings, the paper proposes an optimal forwarder selection scheme to minimize the number of rebroadcasting nodes and guarantee fast and efficient safety warning information dissemination. The proposed forwarder selection scheme is based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP).

These models can capture spatio-temporal characteristics of traffic situations. Given a new, partially observed and unlabeled trajectory, the maneuver can be recognized online by comparing the likelihoods of the observation data for each individual regression model. Furthermore, we take advantage of our representation for trajectory prediction. Because predicting possible trajectories at urban intersection involves obvious multimodalities and non-linearities, we employ the Monte Carlo method to handle these difficulties.

Noise removal and headlight detection based on the input images are proposed to make the disparity image suitable for a 2.5D occupancy grid mapping algorithm. In the second part of the work the concrete application of such a stereo grid map is shown and evaluated: The stereo map is applied to a localization task on a digital navigation map.

In normal vehicle, a system that helps a driver to perceive the details of traffic signals, necessary to drive, could be critical in a delicate driving manoeuvre (i.e crossing an intersection of roads). Furthermore, traffic lights detection by an autonomous vehicle is a special case of perception, because it is important for the control that the autonomous vehicle must take. Multiples authors have used image processing as a base for achieving traffic light detection. However, the image processing presents a problem regarding conditions for capturing scenes, and therefore, the traffic light detection is affected. For this reason, this paper proposes a method that links the image processing with an estimation state routine formed by Hidden Markov Models (HMM). This method helps to determine the current state of the traffic light detected, based on the obtained states by image processing, aiming to obtain the best performance in the determination of the traffic light states. With the proposed method in this paper, we obtained 90.55% of accuracy in the detection of the traffic light state, versus a 78.54% obtained using solely image processing. The recognition of traffic lights using image processing still has a large dependence on the capture conditions of each frame from the video camera. In this context, the addition of a pre-processing stage before image processing could contribute to improve this aspect, and could provide a better results in determining the traffic light state.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856486","","Image color analysis;Vehicles;Hidden Markov models;Roads;Cameras;Viterbi algorithm","hidden Markov models;image recognition;road safety;road traffic;state estimation;traffic engineering computing;video cameras;video signal processing","traffic lights detection;state estimation;hidden Markov models;road;person safety;autonomous land vehicle;image processing;HMM;traffic light recognition;video camera","","13","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This new approach is based on two parallel tracking stages. Its objective is to improve associations between targets and tracks by avoiding wrong associations which can cause errors on track's path determination. Another interesting point of the proposed approach lies in the fact that the two trackings stages are operated together only when association ambiguities are detected. otherwise, only one tracking is used. This mechanism leads to save computational resources. This contribution comes after previous works achieved at the LIVIC (Laboratory on interactions between vehicles, road network and drivers) regarding to Multi-Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) using the Dempster-Shafer Theory. These previous works discussed the potential interest of considering at the same time multi-hypothesis solutions instead of mono-hypothesis ones. This new approach is more focused on the identification of ambiguities, and runs simultaneously two tracking stages in order to solve these ambiguities thanks to the Dempster-Shafer multi-criteria association rules.

In this regard, one particularly relevant cue is a flashing turn signal, since it gives an important hint regarding the intended driving direction of another vehicle in the next few seconds. As such, turn signals can be considered as one of the first methods invented for car-to-car communication. In contrast to modern radio-based approaches, turn signals are installed in almost every vehicle. However, only image-based methods are able to detect, recognize and understand those signals. In this paper, we present a new method to recognize turn signals of other vehicles in images. Our approach builds upon a robust vehicle detector and involves three major steps applied to each detected vehicle: light spot detection, feature extraction through FFT-based analysis of the temporal signal behavior at each detected light spot, and AdaBoost classification of the extracted feature set.

However, when the terrain tends to be flat and uniform, it is difficult to identify a better path using 3D map solely. In this scenario the use of a priori knowledge on the expected road's visual characteristics can support detection, but it has the drawback of being not robust to environmental changes. This paper presents a path detection method that mixes together 3D mapping and visual classification, trying to learn, in real time, the actual road characteristics. An on-line learning of visual characteristics is implemented to feedback a terrain classifier, so that the road characteristics are updated as the vehicle moves. The feedback data are taken from a 3D traversability cost map, which provides some hints on traversable and non-traversable regions. After several re-training cycles the algorithm converges on a better separation of the path and non-path regions. The fusion of both 3D traversability cost and visual characteristics of the terrain yields a better estimation when compared with either of these methods solely.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856427","","Roads;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Estimation;Image segmentation;Support vector machines;Databases","cartography;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;object detection;path planning;remotely operated vehicles","traversability analysis;terrain mapping;online-trained terrain type classifier;path estimation;autonomous vehicle navigation;3D terrain information;road visual characteristics;path detection method;visual classification;3D traversability cost map","","5","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning traffic situations online has the advantage that it is possible to react to changes in driving behavior due to changes in the environment. If visual obstruction occurs because of changes in the environment, e.g. a growing corn field, the behavior of drivers changes. In contrast to pre-trained models an online learning concept is able to react to these changes in driving behavior. In this contribution Case-Based Reasoning, a concept which adapts human reasoning and thinking to a system, is used. The functionality of the concept is shown by predicting the maneuver of an approaching vehicle at an intersection.

Within the context where fuel is increasingly a major cost center for merchandise transport companies, it is important to recognize different driver behaviors in order to be able to simulate them as closely to the real data as possible during the truck development process. In this paper, we introduce, instead of economic driving, the notion of rational driving which seeks to decrease the average fuel consumption while respecting the transport companies' constraint, i.e., the delivery delay. Moreover, we also propose an indicator, namely rational driving index (RDI), which enables to quantify how good a driver behavior is with respect to the rational driving. We then investigate various driving features contributing to characterize a rational driver behavior, using real driving data collected from 34 different truck drivers on an extra-urban road section particularly representative of travel paths of trucks ensuring regional merchandise distribution. Given the fact that real driving data collected on an open road can differ in terms of environment, e.g., weather, traffic, we further study, through simulations on a digital representation of a roundabout, the impact of two major driving features, i.e., the use of coasting and crossing speed at roundabouts, with respect to rational driving. The experimental results from both real driving data and simulations show high correlations of these two driving features with respect to RDI and demonstrate that a good rational driver tends to decelerate slowly during braking periods (use of coasting) and have high crossing speed in roundabouts.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856440","","Vehicles;Fuels;Roads;Indexes;Companies;Correlation;Engines","fuel economy;human factors;road vehicles;roads","rational truck driving;correlated driving features;truck drivers;fuel consumption;merchandise transport companies;truck development process;economic driving;rational driving index;rational driver behavior;extra-urban road section;digital representation;braking;roundabouts","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One part of the uncertainty in risk estimation is the behavior of the surrounding traffic participants. In this paper we focus on highway scenarios, where possible behaviors consist of a change in acceleration and lane change maneuvers. We present a novel approach for the recognition of lane change intentions of traffic participants. Our novel approach is an extension of the Naïve Bayesian approach and results in a generative model. It builds on the relations to the directly surrounding vehicles and to the static traffic environment. We obtain the conditional probabilities of all relevant features using Gaussian mixtures with a flexible number of components. We systematically reduce the number of features by selecting the most powerful ones. Furthermore we investigate the predictive power of each feature with respect to the time before a lane change event. In a large scale experiment on real world data with over 160.781 samples collected on a test drive of 1100km we trained and validated our intention prediction model and achieved a significant improvement in the recognition performance of lane change intentions compared to current state of the art methods.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856491","","Vehicles;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Vectors;Road transportation;Acceleration;Data models","Bayes methods;feature extraction;Gaussian processes;mixture models;object detection;object recognition;risk analysis;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","lane change detection approach;feature ranking;maximized predictive power;current traffic situation;safe autonomous driving system;risk estimation uncertainty;surrounding traffic participant behavior;highway scenario;acceleration change;lane change maneuver;lane change intention recognition;naive Bayesian approach;generative model;static traffic environment;conditional probabilities;Gaussian mixtures;feature reduction;feature selection;lane change event;intention prediction model;recognition performance","","34","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, recorded digital maps own one drawback: due to road changes and inaccurate recordings, discrepancies between the map and the real world exist. Because these discrepancies can lead to severe application level failures, detection of map errors is essential to ensure overall system integrity. This work proposes a new approach to online verification of digital maps for automotive usage. In contrast to previous work, the described system is able to detect errors in front of the vehicle. On the basis of a large database of map geometry and sensor information, a neural network is trained to classify the digital map integrity by optimally fusing different information sources depending on their strength and reliability. Although generally applicable, it is shown that a combination of orthogonal measurement principles is greatly beneficial for this decision task. A radar sensor, infra-red imagery and road geometry information estimated from visible light images are employed as input for the neural fusion. Experiments on real-world data verify the proposed concepts.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856564","","Vehicles;Feature extraction;Cameras;Roads;Radar imaging;Geometry","cartography;driver information systems;image processing;infrared imaging;lighting;neural nets;road vehicles;sensor fusion","autonomous self-assessment;digital maps;driver assistance systems;optimal lighting conditions;night scenarios;autonomous driving tasks;road changes;application level failures;system integrity;automotive usage;neural network;map geometry;sensor information;information sources;radar sensor;infrared imagery;road geometry information;visible light images;neural fusion;orthogonal measurement principles","","8","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to assist the driver in complex urban intersection situations, an ADAS will be required not only to recognize current but also to anticipate future maneuvers of the involved road users. Current approaches for intention estimation focus mainly on discerning only two intentions based on a vehicle's behavior. We argue that for distinguishing between more than two intentions not just a vehicle's kinematic behavior but also its driving situation needs to be taken into account. In our system we estimate four different intentions by modeling and recognizing driving situations in a Bayesian Network and using the behavior as additional evidence. For the behavior based estimation we present a newly engineered feature, the Anticipated Velocity at Stop line, that turned out to be a very strong indicator for the intention. Our system is evaluated on a real-world data set comprising approaches to seven different intersections on which we can show that our approach is able to estimate a driver's intention with a high accuracy.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856552","","Vehicles;Estimation;Bayes methods;Acceleration;Kinematics;Accuracy;Logistics","behavioural sciences computing;belief networks;road accidents;road traffic;traffic information systems","accident-prone spot;road network;complex urban intersection;vehicle kinematic behavior;driving situation;Bayesian network;behavior based estimation;anticipated velocity at stop line;reliable multiple intention estimation;situation information","","17","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typical low-cost GNSS sensors, as they are commonly used for navigation systems, are limited to an accuracy of several meters. Also, they are restricted in reliability because of outages and multipath effects. To improve accuracy and reliability, 3D features can be used, such as pole-like objects and planes, measured by a laser scanner. These features have to be matched to the reference data, given by a landmark map. If we use a nearest neighbor approach to match the data, we will likely get wrong matches, especially at positions with a low initial accuracy. To reduce the number of wrong matches, we use feature patterns. These patterns describe the spatial relationship of a specific number of features and are determined for every possible feature combination, separated in reference and online features. Given these patterns, the correspondences of the measured features can be determined by finding the corresponding patterns in the reference data. We acquired reference data by a high precision Mobile Mapping System. In an area of 2.8 km<sup>2</sup> we automatically extracted 1390 pole-like objects and 2006 building facades. A (second) vehicle equipped with an automotive laser scanner was used to generate features with lower accuracy and reliability. In every scan of the laser scanner we extracted landmarks (poles and planes) online. We then used our proposed feature matching to find correspondences. In this paper, we show the performance of the approach for different parameter settings and compare it to the nearest neighbor matching commonly used. Our experimental results show that, by using feature patterns, the rate of false matches can be reduced from about 80 % down to 20 %, compared to a nearest neighbor approach.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856460","","Feature extraction;Measurement by laser beam;Accuracy;Vehicles;Automotive engineering;Pattern matching;Three-dimensional displays","automobiles;feature extraction;image matching;image sensors;mobile robots;optical scanners;position control;robot vision;satellite navigation","localization;automotive laser scanners;local pattern matching;autonomous driving;vehicle positioning;low-cost GNSS sensors;navigation systems;3D features;pole-like objects;feature matching;landmark map;nearest neighbor approach;feature patterns;mobile mapping system;building facades;landmark extraction;nearest neighbor matching","","11","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most of the previous study, visual features are fundamental clues for multi-lane detection. However, since visual features vary with the illumination, weather condition and distance of the region, feature-based algorithm is restricted to the illuminant variation and laterally adjacent regions. On the other hand, conventional geometric estimation-based approaches, not relying on visual features, are inaccurate and susceptible to pitch or lateral movement. In this paper, we propose a robust multi-lane detection algorithm based on the accurate geometric estimation in highway scenarios. With the steps of adjacent lanes hypothesis generation (HG) and hypothesis verification (HV), the algorithm detects successfully independent of environmental changes. For accurate adjacent lane HG, we adopt the `cross ratio' and propose `dynamic homography matrix estimation.' Our approach is independent of the calibration, pitch angle changes and additional vehicle sensors. In addition, the proposed algorithm can covers six lanes including the driving lane and adjacent lanes that two-lanes away from the driving lane. We demonstrate robustness on the illumination variance including daytime, rainy and sunset by using trough simulations and video sequences with a resolution of 752 × 480.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856537","","Estimation;Vehicles;Robustness;Roads;Feature extraction;Calibration","calibration;estimation theory;matrix algebra;road safety;video signal processing","hypothesis verification;HG;hypothesis generation;robust multilane detection algorithm;illuminant variation;feature-based algorithm;weather condition;visual features;vehicle safety-related application;highway scenarios;geometric lane estimation","","21","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast to temporal filtering, the proposed approach reduces the time to react to critical situations that occur in many safety and advanced driving assistance applications.

Compared to a fixed manufacturing plant, the quarry processes involve mobile machines such as wheel loaders, trucks and articulated haulers and a highly dynamic road infrastructure. Today, the mobile machines are generally not synchronized or controlled towards the overall throughput of the site in real time. This indicates a general improvement potential in increased productivity at quarry sites, but also unsolved challenges for the same reason. Assuming a wireless control system that controls speed and throughput of the different processes and activities, there would be a fuel reduction potential in controlling the mobile machines. This optimization requires models of machine fuel consumption for different applications, velocities and travel times. The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of fuel measurements based on different speeds, site application characteristics and travel times for hauling operation. The fuel measures reveal important aspects regarding how different velocities impact fuel consumption. The results of fuel measurements show a potential in fuel savings of up to 42% and a typical improvement of 20-30% depending on machine speeds, travel times, application and site characteristics. Based on this, some of the applications and challenges in wirelessly controlling machines are discussed.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856451","Fuel Measurements;Vehicle Control;Hauling optimization;Advanced Driver Assist Systems","Fuels;Vehicles;Gears;Loading;Throughput;Wireless communication","aggregates (materials);production equipment;productivity;quarrying industry;scheduling;velocity control","fuel measurements;fuel reduction potential;productivity;dynamic road infrastructure;articulated haulers;trucks;wheel loaders;mobile machines;manufacturing plant;sequential production processes;aggregate production site;quarry production site;hauling operation;travel times;scheduling;wireless speed control;energy savings","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, solving this problem is a prerequisite for any vehicle driving autonomously in previously unmapped areas. Most of the proposed methods for lane detection are tuned for freeways and rural environments. In urban scenarios, however, they are unable to reliably detect the ego lane in many situations. Often, these methods simply work on the principle of fitting a parametric model to lane markers. Since a large variety of lane shapes are found in urban environments, it is obvious that these models are too restrictive. Moreover, the complex structure of intersection-like situations further hampers the success of the aforementioned methods. Therefore we propose a non-parametric lane model which can handle a wide range of different features such as grass verge, free space, lane markers etc. The ego lane estimation is formulated as a shortest path problem. A directed acyclic graph is constructed from the feature pool rendering it efficiently solvable. The proposed approach is easily extendable as it is able to cope with pixel-wise low level features as well as highlevel ones jointly.

Therefore, we propose a car navigation framework to determine car position and attitude using the built-in sensory data such as a speed, angular rate and the images from a front view camera. The method consists of three steps, 1) dead reckoning using the velocity and yaw rate provided in real-time, 2) image georeferencing based on a sequential bundle adjustment using the dead reckoning results and 3) final estimation using a Kalman filter with the georeferencing results.

In the field of visual perception this task has often been addressed with stereo algorithms that try to obtain a depth map of the environment via disparity calculations on a single pair of images. These algorithms do not exploit that especially in automotive scenarios the fields of view between two consecutive frames have large overlapping regions. Instead, the disparity map is computed from scratch for each stereo frame and no information is propagated from one frame to the next. Since monocular image processing has long benefited from recursive estimation techniques, such as the 4D Approach, this paper presents a novel recursive automotive stereo algorithm, called RAS. RAS internally maintains a list of recursively estimated 3D points that are continuously updated based on the vehicle's movement and measurements in the current stereo frame. We show that RAS not only preserves the knowledge of the environment across frames, but also accounts for measurement modalities and is robust against faulty or even missing measurements.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856481","","Three-dimensional displays;Cameras;Vehicles;Noise measurement;Noise;Ellipsoids;Stereo vision","automobiles;collision avoidance;image motion analysis;navigation;recursive estimation;stereo image processing;traffic engineering computing","recursive automotive stereo algorithm;obstacle avoidance;automotive navigation;visual perception;environment representation;automotive scenarios;disparity map;consecutive stereo frame;monocular image processing;recursive estimation techniques;4D Approach;RAS;vehicle movement;measurement modalities","","2","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our experimental results show that the concept can find weaknesses of planning and control systems and is faster than running a separate simulation sequence for each error pattern.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856565","","Load modeling;Trajectory;Planning;Computational modeling;Actuators;Estimation","actuators;control systems;mobile robots;planning (artificial intelligence);road vehicles;sensors","autonomous driving system testing;sensor error;actuator error;error combinations;planning;control systems","","3","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider the three-dimensional pedestrian body language in order to perform path prediction in a probabilistic framework. For this purpose, the different body parts and joints are detected using stereo vision. We propose the use of GPDM (Gaussian Process Dynamical Models) for reducing the high dimensionality of the input feature vector (composed by joints and displacement vectors) in the 3D pose space and for learning the pedestrian dynamics in a latent space.

This paper introduces a new visual-based localization approach in dynamic traffic environments, focusing on and exploiting properties of structured roads like straight roads or intersections. Such environments show several line segments on lane markings, curbs, poles, building edges, etc., which demonstrate the road's longitude, latitude and vertical directions. Based on this observation, we define a Road Structural Feature (RSF) as sets of segments along three perpendicular axes together with feature points. At each video frame, the proper road structure (or multiple road structures in case of an intersection) is predicted based on the geometric information given by a 2D map. The RSF is then detected from line segments and points extracted from the image, and used to estimate the pose of the vehicle. Experiments are conducted using video streams collected on major roads in downtown Beijing, which are structured and with intense dynamic traffic. GPS/IMU data have been collected and synchronized with the video streams as a reference in validation. The results show good performance compared with that of a more traditional visual odometry method.

The driving simulator also connects to an Android device and sends several kinds of data, such as current GPS coordinates or transportation network data. One important feature of this architecture is its suitability to serve as an appropriate means to conduct behaviour elicitation through peer-designed agents, so as to improve modelling of various driving styles accounting for different aspects of preferences and perception abilities, as well as other performance measures related to drivers' interaction with ADAS solutions.

A Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) detector is used to extract bright areas, i.e. lane markings, from grayscale camera images. Furthermore, this algorithm is also used to extract features from a laser scanner grid map. These regions are automatically stored as landmarks in a geospatial data base during a map creation phase. A particle filter is then employed to perform the pose estimation. For the weight update of the filter the similarity between the set of online MSER detections and the set of mapped landmarks within the field of view is evaluated. Hereby, a two stage sensor fusion is carried out. First, in order to have a large field of view available, not only a forward facing camera but also a rearward facing camera is used and the detections from both sensors are fused. Secondly, the weight update also integrates the features detected from the laser grid map, which is created using measurements of three laser scanners. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a 7 km long stretch of a rural road. The evaluation reveals that a relatively good position estimation and a very accurate orientation estimation (0.01 deg ± 0.22 deg) can be achieved using the presented localization method. In addition, an evaluation of the localization performance based only on each of the respective kinds of MSER features is provided in this contribution and compared to the combined approach.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856413","","Vehicles;Cameras;Feature extraction;Lasers;Measurement by laser beam;Roads;Standards","driver information systems;feature extraction;particle filtering (numerical methods);pose estimation;sensor fusion","multisensor self-localization;maximally stable extremal regions;online MSER detections;driver assistance systems;feature extraction;particle filter;pose estimation;rural road;position estimation;orientation estimation;laser scanner grid map;grayscale camera images;geospatial data base;sensor fusion","","20","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result of the analysis, we found that aging affects several test results, such as the percentage of correct answers and the reaction times in multiple judgment tasks tests. In order to be able to classify a driver as a high accident risk, we performed an outlier analysis using a one-class SVM to investigate performance characteristics, and also performed a logistics regression analysis. Using parameters strongly related to cognitive decline, we found a viable way to classify impaired drivers. Driving is a complex task requiring integration of cognition, judgment, and operation skills. Deterioration of these skills is likely to increase the risk of traffic accidents.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting the next contextual changing point of driving behavior on the basis of a Bayesian double articulation analyzer. To develop the method, we extended a previously proposed semiotic predictor using an unsupervised double articulation analyzer that can extract a two-layered hierarchical structure from driving-behavior data. We employ the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden semi-Markov model [4] to model duration time of a segment of driving behavior explicitly instead of the sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) employed in the previous model [13]. Then, to recover the hierarchical structure of contextual driving behavior as a sequence of chunks, we use the Nested Pitman-Yor Language model [6], which can extract latent words from sequences of latent letters. On the basis of the extension, we develop a method for calculating posterior probability distribution of the next contextual changing point by marginalizing potentially possible results of the chunking method and potentially successive words theoretically. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied the method to synthetic data and driving behavior data that was recorded in a real environment. The results showed that the proposed method can predict the next contextual changing point more accurately and in a longer-term manner than the compared methods: linear regression and Recurrent Neural Networks, which were trained through a supervised learning scheme.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856468","","Hidden Markov models;Time series analysis;Vehicles;Probability;Computational modeling;Semiotics;Context","Bayes methods;driver information systems;hidden Markov models;recurrent neural nets;statistical distributions;unsupervised learning","unsupervised Bayesian double articulation analyzer;next contextual changing point;driving behavior;advanced driver assistance systems;semiotic predictor;two-layered hierarchical structure;hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden semiMarkov model;nested Pitman-Yor language model;latent words;posterior probability distribution;linear regression;recurrent neural networks;supervised learning scheme","","4","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The systems processing chain comprises separate modules for head separation, pose estimation and pose tracking. Head separation employes a Bayesian modeling approach for robust head-torso separation. The pose estimation module uses Synchronized Submanifold Embedding (SSE), a nonlinear regression method, which includes a dimensionality reduction, a k-nearest neighbor search and a barycentric coordinate estimation. The tracking module estimates angular velocity of the head, using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in quaternion space. Comprehensive experiments show, that the proposed system achieves high accuracy from a non-central camera position.

The trajectory is colored using the RGB color space, which corresponds to the extracted three-dimensional features.

The road data was trained with an artificial neural network (ANN) and classified into eight road geometries: straight road, left turn, right turn, left side road, right side road, T intersection, Y intersection and crossroad. The main advantage of our method is its robustness to light variations for detecting distinct roads even in the presence of noisy data thanks to the ANN. In order to determine which road information has the best features for ANN training, three approaches were explored: ANN trained with curb data, ANN trained with surface data and ANN trained with both curb and surface data. Performed experiments resulted in the superiority of the network trained with both curb and surface data, with an accuracy of 0.91799. The trained ANN was validated in different urban scenarios and, evaluating a 1 Km track, we obtained a 94.48% of correct classifications. These results are superior than other works that detect fewer number of road shapes.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856513","","Roads;Artificial neural networks;Geometry;Detectors;Topology;Training;Network topology","geometry;neural nets;pattern classification;traffic information systems","road geometry classification;ANN;autonomous car;road geometry information;topological localization;road detector;multilayer laser sensor data;artificial neural network;straight road;left turn;right turn;left side road;right side road;T intersection;Y intersection;crossroad;surface data;curb data","","1","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

State-of-the-art ADAS rely on lane markings to draw inference about the extent of lanes or the road area. However, on many rural or urban roads markings are worn out or simply not existing. Therefore, this publication proposes a system for vision-based road boundary detection without requiring road markings at the outer side of the road. The fundamental approach is a boundary vicinity classification based on SPatial RAY (SPRAY) features which combines visual and spatial context information going beyond classical image patch analysis. More specifically, the inner road boundary vicinity (IBV), the outer road boundary vicinity (OBV), and the remaining part of the road area (RA) are detected. Because these classes occur in a defined sequence, i.e., a road boundary exhibits a transition from RA to IBV to OBV, this approach extracts the horizontal boundary transition pattern to make inference about possible locations of road boundaries and their direction (left or right road side). The implemented system was evaluated on unmarked urban and rural roads. The results show that the system effectively detects road boundaries such as curbstones and soft shoulders under challenging conditions.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856453","","Roads;Feature extraction;Visualization;Measurement;Training;Transforms;Kernel","computer vision;driver information systems;object detection;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","Visio-spatial road boundary detection;unmarked urban road;rural road markings;robust detection;advanced driver assistant system;ADAS;lane departure warning;lane keeping assistant system;lane markings;vision-based road boundary detection;boundary vicinity classification;spatial ray;image patch analysis;inner road boundary vicinity;IBV;outer road boundary vicinity","","5","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This second step consists of applying scanning windows at multiple scales. Depending on the number of scales and on the image dimension, this step is slow because a large number of windows is generated. An efficient pruning algorithm able to remove most of the scan windows brings a significant contribution on the overall execution time. We propose a scan window pruning algorithm based on a combination of several filters: (1) remove windows based on the relation between the dimension and the position in the scene; (2) remove uniform regions from the image such as the sky or the road; (3) remove regions with high density of horizontal edges such as vegetation parts; (4) keep local maxima windows having a high density of connected vertical edges. The combination of these four filters eliminates more than 90% of the scanning windows in a given image and maintains the windows that are overlapped on regions with a high probability of representing a pedestrian. We have integrated our method in a generic framework for pedestrian detection [1] and we have studied two aspects: (1)how the performance of the algorithms varies with respect to the filters proposed by our pruning strategy and (2) what is the speed gain when the quality loss is negligible. The proposed filters have a negligible loss in performance and even improve it in some cases while the execution time is improved.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856571","","Image edge detection;Cameras;Detectors;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Roads;Vegetation mapping","feature extraction;filtering theory;image classification;image representation;pedestrians","scan window-based pedestrian recognition method improvement;search space;scale reduction;computation time;pedestrian detector;feature computation;multiscale classification;image dimension;window pruning algorithm;window removal;scene dimension;scene position;uniform region removal;sky image;road image;horizontal edges;vegetation parts;local maxima windows;connected vertical edges;overlapped image;pedestrian representation;generic pedestrian detection framework;performance improvement;execution time improvement","","5","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to achieve these goals, it is desirable to incorporate higher-order object knowledge in the stereo vision-based understanding of traffic scenes. In particular, object shape and dimension information can help to achieve correct interpretations. However, typically this kind of higher-order information results in a difficult energy minimization problem since large areas of the input image have to be constrained. In this contribution, an efficient global optimization approach based on dynamic programming is proposed that is able to take into account such higher-order object knowledge.

In stereo vision, the error of depth reconstruction increases quadratically with distance. This makes estimation of surface normals an especially demanding task. In this paper, we analyze how error propagates from noisy disparity data to the orientation of the estimated surface normal. Firstly, we derive a transformation for normals between disparity space and world coordinates. Afterwards, the propagation of disparity noise is analyzed by means of a Monte Carlo method. Normal reconstruction at a pixel position requires to consider a certain neighborhood of the pixel. The extent of this neighborhood affects the reconstruction error. Our method allows to determine the optimal neighborhood size required to achieve a pre specified deviation of the angular reconstruction error, defined by a confidence interval. We show that the reconstruction error only depends on the distance of the surface point to the camera, the pixel distance to the principal point in the image plane and the angle at which the viewing ray intersects the surface.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856436","","Surface reconstruction;Noise;Cameras;Image reconstruction;Vectors;Three-dimensional displays;Noise measurement","computer vision;image reconstruction;Monte Carlo methods;stereo image processing","accuracy analysis;surface normal reconstruction;stereo vision;surface normal estimation;computer vision;surface reconstruction;surface registration;object detection;depth reconstruction;error propagation;disparity noise propagation;Monte Carlo method;angular reconstruction error","","2","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To avoid obstructions in the field of view, such cameras need to be mounted in an exposed position. Alternatively, a multicamera setup can be used. However, this requires the extrinsic calibration to be known. In the present work, we propose a method to calibrate a fisheye multi-camera rig, mounted on a mobile platform. The method only relies on feature correspondences from pairwise overlapping fields of view of adjacent cameras. In contrast to existing approaches, motion estimation or specific motion patterns are not required. To compensate for the large extent of multi-camera setups and corresponding viewpoint variations, as well as geometrical distortions caused by fisheye lenses, captured images are mapped into virtual camera views such that corresponding image regions coincide. To this end, the scene geometry is approximated by the ground plane in close proximity and by infinitely far away objects elsewhere. As a result, low complexity feature detectors and matchers can be employed. The approach is evaluated using a setup of four rigidly coupled and synchronized wide angle fisheye cameras that were attached to four sides of a mobile platform. The cameras have pairwise overlapping fields of view and baselines between 2.25 and 3 meters.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856403","","Cameras;Calibration;Vectors;Feature extraction;Robustness;Estimation;Tracking","calibration;cameras;computer vision;feature extraction;geometry;motion estimation","extrinsic fisheye multicamera setup calibration;computer vision algorithms;omnidirectional cameras;fisheye multicamera rig;mobile platform;feature correspondences;motion estimation;motion patterns;fisheye lenses;virtual camera;image regions;scene geometry;complexity feature detectors;synchronized wide angle fisheye cameras","","1","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First a set of Haar features are computed and individual pixel responses are normalized to L2 unit length. Thereafter features are pooled over a predefined neighborhood region. The concatenation of several such features form the basis DIRD vector. These features are then quantized to maximize entropy allowing (among others) a binary version of DIRD consisting of only ones and zeros for very fast matching.

For traffic light recognition, color segmentation is widely used to detect traffic light signals; however, the color in an image is easily affected by various illuminations and leads to incorrect recognition results. In order to overcome the problem, we propose the multiple exposure technique which enhances the robustness of the color segmentation and recognition accuracy by integrating both low and normal exposure images. The technique solves the color saturation problem and reduces false positives since the low exposure image is exposed for a short time. Based on candidate regions selected from the low exposure image, the status of six three and four bulb traffic lights in a normal image are classified utilizing a support vector machine with a histogram of oriented gradients. Our algorithm was finally evaluated in various urban scenarios and the results show that the proposed method works robustly for outdoor environments.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856541","","Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Colored noise;Lighting;Support vector machines;Image recognition;Cameras","image colour analysis;image recognition;image segmentation;signal detection;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing","multiple exposure image based traffic light recognition method;color segmentation;traffic light signal detection;color saturation problem;support vector machine;oriented gradient histogram","","15","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The homography matrix comprises motion as well as ground plane information. Estimation of the homography matrix is challenging, as measurements are often not only corrupted by sparse gross outliers, but might also contain other structures, which are inconsistent with the ground plane such as curbstones and sidewalks. Several well studied algorithms regarding the identification of sparse gross outliers already exist. However, identifying structural outliers remains a challenging problem due the outliers' inner coherence. In homography and plane estimation structural outliers often cause plane fits that do not correspond to any physical plane in the scene. We make use of the large field of view of fisheye cameras by exploiting that outlier identification can be performed more robustly in the near field where motion parallax vectors are large. More sensitive data can then be tested subsequently based on the preceding results. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we present a statistical analysis of parallax amplitudes that are to be expected due to the distance of a point from the ground plane and measurement noise. This leads to a statistical test for outliers with local adaptive thresholds. Second, we embed this concept into an extended Kalman filter for efficient processing. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of warping captured images into a common frame previous to feature detection and matching to avoid distortion effects and to equalize search regions. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach and the effects of prewarping on the estimation using real data.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856402","","Cameras;Kalman filters;Robustness;Estimation;Vectors;Noise;Noise measurement","cameras;computer vision;feature extraction;image matching;image motion analysis;Kalman filters;matrix algebra;nonlinear filters;statistical testing;vectors","motion parallax vectors;parallax amplitude statistical analysis;statistical test;extended Kalman filter;captured image warping;feature detection;feature matching;structural outlier identification;homography matrix estimation;computer vision applications;wide angle fisheye cameras;robust ground plane induced homography estimation","","1","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It represents a significant task for the semantic understanding of images and has received plentiful attention over the last years. The current state of art is dominated by conditional random field based approaches, defined over pixels or image segments. However, high accuracy segmentation comes at a high computational cost. The best performing methods can barely run at few frames per second and are far from real-time applications. Our goal is to bridge the gap between current state of the art segmentation approaches and real-time applications. In this paper we propose an efficient approach for individual pixel classification. Multiple local descriptors are computed densely and then quantized using visual codebooks. Joint boosting is used to classify each pixel based on the quantized local descriptors. We show that using careful design choices and GPU optimization we can achieve sate of the art segmentation results at over 50 FPS. We also propose a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model defined over superpixels that uses the proposed pixel classifier for the estimation of unary potentials. The CRF based multi-class segmentation can run at over 30 FPS. The proposed approach is validated on the MSRC21 and CamVid multi-class segmentation benchmarks, the former one consisting of urban traffic sequences.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856594","","Image segmentation;Semantics;Accuracy;Image color analysis;Visualization;Graphics processing units;Training","graphics processing units;image classification;image segmentation;image sequences;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","multi-class segmentation;traffic scenario;class label;image semantic understanding;conditional random field based approach;segmentation approach;pixel classification;visual codebook;joint boosting;quantized local descriptors;GPU optimization;graphics processing unit;CRF model;superpixels;MSRC21;CamVid;urban traffic sequences","","7","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead of using the matching cost of one disparity within a matching block, the best matching for several disparities are first selected for each pixel and then these best matches are combined to the final block-matching value. Results on the KITTI benchmark show that this scheme increases the performance of block-matching stereo especially for large matching windows, however, there is also a significant increase for smaller block sizes. Furthermore, we show that a straightforward combination with the appearance-aligned block-matching stereo leads to results that surpass the performance of both single techniques.","1931-0587","978-1-4799-3638","10.1109/IVS.2014.6856414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6856414","","Correlation;Standards;Computed tomography;Cameras;Benchmark testing;Cost function;Transforms","image matching;stereo image processing","block-matching stereo scheme;relaxed fronto-parallel assumption;disparity cost;matching block;block-matching value;KITTI benchmark;matching windows;appearance-aligned block-matching stereo","","18","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
