The algorithm is based on a cooperative tracking and sensor fusion algorithm that we previously developed. The ego vehicle is equipped with lane keeping and lane changing capabilities, as well as a forward-looking lidar sensor. The lidar data are fed to the tracking module which detects other vehicles, such as the vehicle that is to be overtaken (leading) and the oncoming traffic. Based on the estimated distances to the leading and the oncoming vehicles and their speeds, a risk is calculated and a corresponding overtaking decision is made. We compare the performance of the overtaking algorithm between the case when the ego vehicle only relies on its lidar sensor, and the case in which it fuses object estimates received from the leading car which also has a forward-looking lidar. Systematic evaluations are performed in Webots, a calibrated high-fidelity simulator.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535519","","Automobiles;Target tracking;Laser radar;Intelligent vehicles;Clustering algorithms;Fuses","intelligent robots;intelligent transportation systems;mobile robots;optical radar;road vehicles;sensor fusion","overtaking decision algorithm;networked intelligent vehicles;cooperative perception;cooperative tracking;sensor fusion;ego vehicle;lane keeping capabilities;lane changing capabilities;forward-looking lidar sensor;Webots;calibrated high-fidelity simulator","","1","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The direct yaw moment control of a road vehicle is aimed by the intervention of individual braking forces. The optimal controller has been designed to minimize the given criteria function. This function has two essential elements: the control performance measure and the input power. The employment of yaw moment and yaw rate in the control performance measure enables the incorporation of the most important dynamics into the control law. By designing the input power based on the braking forces, the yaw moment input is automatically calculated by the controller. The effectiveness of the control approach has been shown by the application of the controller in the case of rapid lane change for two different initial velocity conditions.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535440","Direct yaw moment control;optimal control;active safety;vehicle dynamics","Vehicles;Tires;Optimal control;Vehicle dynamics;Mathematical model;Wheels;Stability analysis","braking;control system synthesis;minimisation;optimal control;position control;road vehicles;stability;velocity control","road vehicle stability enhancement;energy optimal control;direct yaw moment control;braking force;optimal controller design;criteria function minimization;velocity condition","","1","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detection and recognition of tail light signal is important to prevent an autonomous vehicle from rear-end collisions or accidents. Although sensors like acoustic sonar or commercialized Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) products such as mobileye could be used for rear-end collision warning, a cost-effective approach is expected. In this paper, we have developed a novel two-stage approach to detect vehicles and recognize brake lights from a single image in real-time. Unlike previous approaches where pair taillight has to be extracted explicitly, we use vehicle rear appearance image instead. On a large database, “Brake Lights Patterns” (BLP) are learned by a multi-layer perception neural network. Given an image, the vehicles can be classified as “brake” or “normal” using the deep classifier. The vehicle can be detected quickly and robustly by combining multi-layer lidar (IBEO Lux fusion system) and a camera. Road segmentation and a novel vanishing point region of interest (ROI) determination method are explored to further speed up the detection and improve the robustness.

Precise information about vehicle dynamics states is essential for the safety and stability of vehicle. In particular, the tire-road contact forces and vehicle side slip angle are the most important parameters for evaluating the safety of vehicle. Nevertheless, these dynamics states are immeasurable with low cost sensors. Therefore, different observers, or the so-called virtual sensors are developed to estimate vehicle dynamics states. However, the existing observers are only capable in estimating vehicle dynamics states at a current instant but not to predict the potential dangers in a future instant. In order to make time for correcting drive behaviors, especially when driving at high speed, it seems very appealing for us to predict an impending dangerous event and react before the danger occurs. In this paper, the estimation of vehicle dynamics states is based on the fusion of information from inertial sensors, GPS and OpenStreetMap. The geometry of the upcoming path ahead of vehicle is provided by the digital map and is employed to predict the future dynamics states.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535387","","Roads;Vehicles;Vehicle dynamics;Mathematical model;Estimation;Sensors;Geometry","cartography;geographic information systems;mechanical engineering computing;observers;road safety;road vehicles;sensor fusion;stability;traffic engineering computing;vehicle dynamics","vehicle dynamics state estimation;vehicle dynamics state prediction;OpenStreetMap;vehicle dynamics models;digital road map;vehicle safety;vehicle stability;vehicle side slip angle;tire-road contact forces;low cost sensors;observers;virtual sensors;inertial sensors;GPS","","1","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a complicated relation between the confidence of what hinders that might exist coming out of an environment perception block, and the tactical decisions about the driving style done by the autonomous vehicle. A good strategy that enables safety assessment according to ISO26262 implies that the environment perception block should address its safety requirements for all the ASIL attribute values simultaneously.

The state-of-the-art prediction algorithms tend to show limited performance on long-term predictions due to their deterministic nature. In this paper, a probabilistic lateral motion prediction algorithm is proposed based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) approach. The MLP model consists of two parts; target lane and trajectory models. In order to develop an intuitive and accurate prediction algorithm, a lane-based trajectory prediction model is introduced based on the fact that vehicles drive within a lane except for during lane changes. More specifically, a set of three representative trajectories with different levels of lane-change positions are generated for each target lane, and real-world traffic data is categorized by each trajectory for MLP training. These target lane and trajectory models enable the stochastic MLP modeling and training. The proposed MLP model outputs probabilities of how likely a vehicle will follow each trajectory and each lane for a given input of vehicle position history including current position. For training the MLP model, Next Generation Simulation traffic data are used. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm detects lane-changes one to one and a half second earlier than existing methods and three seconds before lane crossing with about ninety percentages accuracy.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535559","","Intelligent vehicles","intelligent transportation systems;mobile robots;motion control;multilayer perceptrons;neurocontrollers;probability;stochastic processes;trajectory control;vehicles","multilayer perceptron;surrounding vehicle;autonomous vehicle;autonomous driving system;probabilistic lateral motion prediction;MLP approach;target lane;lane-based trajectory prediction model;lane-change position;stochastic MLP modeling;vehicle position history","","7","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The presented method merges the strong points of two different control theories: Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Allocation (CA); MPC explicitly considers the motion actuators dynamics before deciding on a suitable input for the actuators while CA dynamically decides how to use the motion actuators in order to modify the vehicle behaviour. The designed MPCA formulation belongs to the class of Quadratic Programming (QP) problems so that the solution is optimization based, i.e. at every step a quadratic cost function has to be minimized while fulfilling a set of linear constraints. Three scenarios were set up to evaluate the effectiveness of the controller: split-μ braking, split-μ acceleration and brake blending. Split-μ means that the wheels on one side of the vehicle are in contact with a slippery surface (e.g. ice) while the wheels of the other side lay on a normal surface (e.g. dry asphalt). The split-μ scenarios aim to combine three different types of motion actuators, disc brakes, powertrain and rear active steering (RAS), in order to brake/accelerate the vehicle while keeping it on course. The third scenario is a mild braking event on a normal road and its purpose is to combine the use of the engine brake with the disc brakes. Simulation results of the scenarios have shown promising vehicle performance when using MPCA to coordinate the motion actuators. Tests on a real vehicle have then confirmed the expected vehicle behaviour in a slit-μ braking scenario. MPCA has also been compared to a simpler CA formulation, in all scenarios. The performance of the two is comparable in steady state, but MPCA shows advantages in transients, whereas CA is less computationally demanding.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535447","","Vehicles;Actuators;Wheels;Vehicle dynamics;Dynamics;Brakes;Axles","acceleration control;actuators;brakes;motion control;predictive control;quadratic programming;road traffic control;vehicles","motion actuator coordination;heavy vehicle;model predictive control allocation;motion actuator dynamics;quadratic programming;optimization;quadratic cost function;linear constraint;split-μ braking;split-μ acceleration;brake blending;disc brake;powertrain;rear active steering;engine brake","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These vehicles develop missions in unstructured environments, usually off-road, and must be able of combining autonomous behaviors plus tele-operation from a command station. In this paper we present the application of the civil autonomous vehicle technology to develop a demonstrator of UGV for the Spanish Army, including the background, architecture and first field tests.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535371","","Intelligent vehicles","autonomous aerial vehicles;military vehicles;road vehicles;surveillance","surveillance missions;off-road environment;drones;combat missions;NATO countries;unmanned aerial vehicle;UAV;civil autonomous vehicle technology;unmanned ground vehicles;UGV;field tests","","2","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These sensors generate large volumes of data which can reveal useful information for enhancing the sustainable development (through improved utilization of resources), as well as the safety and functionality of the system. In this context, a key challenge is to reduce the large data streams into manageable sets of valuable information in a real-time, reliable and cost-affordable fashion. Due to the data volume size and velocity, relying exclusively on traditional data processing systems, such as databases and batch processing, is no longer a suitable option, since it is not feasible to store the data to later process it. Moreover, careful decisions should be made to leverage the existing computing capacity, from embedded devices found in the IVSs to cloud infrastructures. In this paper we study trade-offs of possible options for data-stream processing models and computing infrastructures. Through building an experimental platform that emulates realistic components of a future deployable IVS and validating two different data-stream processing systems with a wellknown benchmark for IVSs, we study options and trade-offs in real-time data stream processing in IVS infrastructures. Our evaluation shows that existing data-stream processing models can be leveraged in different ways, based on the processing requirements.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535450","","Computational modeling;Sensors;Vehicles;Data models;Sparks;Privacy;Data processing","cloud computing;data handling;intelligent transportation systems;vehicles","intelligent vehicular systems;in-vehicle sensors;cameras;sustainable development;data volume size;data volume velocity;data processing systems;embedded devices;cloud infrastructures;data-stream processing models;computing infrastructures;IVS infrastructures","","1","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose an object-oriented probabilistic approach that detects interactions between vehicles and is able to infer possible routes of traffic participants. Using the Object-Oriented Probabilistic Relational Modelling Language (OPRML), the interactions between vehicles can be modeled in an intuitive direct way. The probabilistic component allows Bayesian Inference on noisy sensor data and uncertain dependencies, while the object-orientation makes the model flexible to a varying number of traffic participants. Street-dependent as well as interaction-dependent motion models are learned from simulated situations and recordings of real traffic scenes.

Beside the longitudinal degree of freedom, two lateral degrees of freedom can be controlled relative to the path.

For real-time applications, most studies focus on using stereo cameras to reconstruct a 3D model of the obstacles or to estimate their depth. Instead, in this paper, a method that mimics the human behavior of detecting the state of the approaching obstacles using single camera is proposed. During the flight, this method is able to detect the changes of the size area of the obstacles. First, the method detects the feature points of the obstacles, and then extracts the obstacles that has probability of getting close. In addition, by comparing the changes in the area ratios of the obstacle in the image sequence, the method can decide if it is obstacle or not. Finally, by estimating the obstacle 2D position in the image and combining with the tracked waypoints, the UAV can take the action of avoidance.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535370","","Feature extraction;Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Sensors;Laser radar;Solid modeling;Navigation","autonomous aerial vehicles;cameras;CMOS image sensors;collision avoidance;feature extraction;image sequences;mobile robots;object detection;pose estimation;robot vision","obstacle 2D position estimation;image sequence;obstacles feature point extraction;CMOS camera;lightweight sensors;on-board sensors;small aerial vehicles;microaerial vehicles;unmanned aerial vehicles;monocular vision-based obstacle avoidance;monocular vision-based obstacle detection","","5","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the hybrid control framework used for modeling switching of control authority between manual and automated driving. Also, first results of evaluating stable switching and the inclusion of parameters to address effects of driver comfort and safety are presented. The system developed in this paper consists of an automated driving system that is a combination of a cruise control system and an automated lane keeping system. The manual driving component is modeled as a preview steering controller with a neuromuscular dynamics component. A novel feature of our approach is using the concept of hybrid automata to model the different modes of driving, using the concept of average dwell time to evaluate stability, and using metric interval temporal logic to incorporate verification of different parameters that may affect the switching.

The decision to switch to it from the CA model is formulated as a maneuver detection problem. A maneuver is detected through monitoring measurement innovations of a Kalman filter that tracks target longitudinal states. The longitudinal jerk, as a dynamic characteristic of a maneuver is also estimated from measurement innovations. Finally the estimated jerk and context information are incorporated into the quintic polynomial model.

The proposed localization algorithm consists of three sections: a lane detection, a position correction, and a localization filter. A lane information is extracted from AVM image around the vehicle. This lane information is possible to correct vehicle position by the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm which estimates the rigid transformation between the lane map and lanes obtained by AVM in real-time. The corrected vehicle position by this transformation is fused with the information of vehicle sensors based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF).

Our formulation allows to simultaneously solve a discrete optimal vehicle ordering problem, and a (discretized) continuous optimal velocity planning problem taking into account kinodynamics constraints. This allows faster pruning of the decision tree for the discrete problem, thus reducing computation time.

A velocity-dependent inter-vehicle spacing policy is rigorously addressed. The approach used is both multi-layered and consensus-based. The multi-layer approach allows to separate the problem of estimating the desired trajectories from the problem of controlling the vehicles towards those trajectories while keeping a safety distance.

In this paper, we present a learning-based trajectory generation approach for implementing an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) with the lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control functions in urban environment. More specifically, a number of objects of interest, including the road and lane boundaries, as well as the surrounding vehicles, are detected and tracked. Particularly, the leader vehicle in the host lane, if available, is detected to provide the real-time, on-site and validated information, including both movements and decisions of how it copes with the current traffic situation, which is subsequently learnt by the ego vehicle for the control purposes. By combining the prior and “live” information of the road environment, a safe, smooth and reasonable trajectory is finally generated based on a cubic spline model with the Mass-Spring-Damper (MSD) system. Experimental results in various typical but challenging urban traffic scenes have substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535548","","Trajectory;Automobiles;Roads;History;Urban areas;Advanced driver assistance systems","adaptive control;driver information systems;intelligent transportation systems;learning systems;road traffic control;splines (mathematics);trajectory control","learning-based trajectory generation;intelligent vehicle;urban traffic;advanced driver assistance system;ADAS;adaptive cruise control function;road environment;cubic spline model;mass-spring-damper system","","5","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Korea","2016 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","","2016","","","78","79","According to a report, night time and poor illumination driving is overall 2-3 times more dangerous then day time. For example, young people aged 18-24 were killed between 21:00 and 05:59 (the night-time and early morning) on week-days in the EU-23 countries because of road accident in 2010. As the similar pattern with EU, most pedestrian-vehicle accidents occur between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m., and the rate of pedestrian fatalities is highest between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. in South Korea. Among several factors such as inebriated drivers and pedestrian, drowsiness, decreased visibility is the major cause of pedestrian-vehicle accident at night. To reduce the accident owing to driver's inattention at night, recent advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) has been researching on automatic pedestrian detection and tracking using night vision camera. Therefore, this tutorial focuses on introducing a multiple pedestrians tracking system using a thermal camera that is able to discern thermal energy at night-time. In a pedestrian tracking-by-detection system, multi-pedestrian detection accuracy is essential for post tracking process. Since the temperature difference between the pedestrian and background depends on the season and weather, we therefore first introduce two models for detecting pedestrians according to the season and weather, which are determined using Weber-Fechner's law. Two detection models use the optimal levels of the image scaling and search area instead of image pyramid to reduce the computational cost of image scaling for detecting multiple pedestrians of various sizes. Online learning is appropriate in the case that image frames is obtained sequentially. Theoretically offline learning could obtain global optimal solution while it is not as practical as online learning. Therefore, we introduce some state-of-the-art real-time online learning algorithms with our online learning based on boosted random ferns (BRFs) in detail based on the references as the second topic. Third, for association checking of multiple pedestrians, we explain the advantages and disadvantages of feed-forward system and global association system. Feed-forward system uses only current and past observations, which is called tracklet to estimate the current tracker's state. On contrary, global association system uses future and global information to estimate the current tracker's state in an offline step, for example, bipartite graph matching, Hungarian algorithm, dynamic programming, and min-cost max-flow network flow. Because maintaining the tracker's ID in successive frames is a challenging task owing to overlapping pedestrians in the multiple pedestrians tracking system, we introduce a few association checking algorithms to maintain the tracker's ID. As the feature for association checking, we also explain popular features in computer vision, such as the spatial proximity, velocity orientation and context (shape, size, color). Fourth, we introduce a few evaluation video sequences for pedestrian tracking such as OSli thermal pedestrian database, CVC-09 sequences, KAIST benchmark dataset, and KMliTD dataset. In particular, we are focusing on the KMliTD which contains video sequences involving a moving camera, moving multiple pedestrians, sudden shape deformations, unexpected motion changes, and partial or full occlusions between pedestrians at summer and winter night. Finally, we introduce the evaluation methods to measure the performance of the pedestrian tracking system such as Multiple Object Tracking Precision (MOTP) and Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), and Tracking Distance Error (TDE). The performance comparison among different tracking approaches is also presented when the proposed online tracking method is applied to benchmark data. As the further research in multiple pedestrians tracking, we will guide the fusion of sensors such as Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) sensor or Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor with a camera for overcome the limitations occurred in a standalone sensor. In addition, with the increasing sensor resolutions, we mention the plan how to develop computationally feasible multi-extended object tracking algorithm.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535367","","Radar tracking;Computer vision;Sensors;Conferences;Object tracking;Accidents;Cameras","cameras;computer vision;dynamic programming;graph theory;image sequences;night vision;object tracking;pedestrians;road accidents;sensor fusion","online learning;multiple pedestrians tracking;thermal imagery;safe driving;night time;poor illumination driving;EU-23 countries;pedestrian-vehicle accidents;South Korea;advanced driver assistance system;ADAS;automatic pedestrian detection;automatic pedestrian tracking;night vision camera;thermal energy;Weber-Fechner law;image scaling;search area;global optimal solution;boosted random ferns;feedforward system;global association system;bipartite graph matching;Hungarian algorithm;dynamic programming;min-cost max-flow network flow;computer vision;video sequences;moving camera;moving multiple pedestrians;sensor fusion;object tracking","","2","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A major challenge in this problem is a requirement for integrating individual vehicle behaviors such as lane-keeping and collision avoidance with a global formation maintenance behavior. We propose a hierarchical Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach. The desired formation is modeled as a virtual structure evolving curvilinearly along a centerline, and vehicle configurations are expressed as curvilinear relative longitudinal and lateral offsets from the virtual center. At high-level, the trajectory generation of the virtual center is achieved through an MPC framework, which allows various on-road driving constraints to be considered in the optimization. At low-level, a local MPC controller computes the vehicle inputs in order to track the desired trajectory, taking into account more personalized driving constraints. High-fidelity simulations show that the proposed approach drives vehicles to the desired formation while retains some freedom for individual vehicle behaviors.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535413","","Vehicles;Trajectory;Roads;Collision avoidance;Vehicle dynamics;Autonomous automobiles","collision avoidance;maintenance engineering;mobile robots;predictive control;road vehicles;trajectory control","hierarchical model predictive control framework;on-road formation control;autonomous vehicles;multilane road;vehicle behaviors;lane-keeping;collision avoidance;global formation maintenance behavior;hierarchical MPC approach;vehicle configurations;curvilinear relative longitudinal offsets;curvilinear relative lateral offsets;trajectory generation;on-road driving constraints;local MPC controller;trajectory tracking;personalized driving constraints;high-fidelity simulations","","9","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this, we have developed theory and algorithms which, based on information about the positions of surrounding vehicles, give the probability of being in each of the current number of lanes. The object positions are provided by one or several low-cost on-board perception sensors. The derived Bayesian filter is evaluated on real data from a prototype self-driving car.

The input includes a reference map of pitch difference and measurements from rear wheel encoders and inertial measurement units (IMU). This method consists of two steps. In the first step, terrain map is generated using pitch difference at equidistant intervals. After that, the Bayesian inference and particle filters are adopted in the second step to identify the vehicle location during travel. To enhance system stability, we propose dynamic distributions of filter variances according to acceleration input.

Firstly, this paper states requirements on assessment metrics. Secondly, this paper introduces a simple but comprehensive metric to select objects and situations out of a typical test drive to reduce the amount of data saved for further analysis. As it must not be assumed that the same situations are critical for human drivers and for automation, the metric only relies on driving dynamics and the physical possibilities of the vehicle.

We derive models based off of human perception and interaction with the environment (e.g. other vehicles on the road), that is generalizable and flexible enough to detect intent across different drivers. The resulting detection scheme is able to determine driver intent with high accuracy across multiple drivers, relying on a large dataset consisting of lane changes under varying environmental constraints.

The benefit of using the VLC system for platooning control is showed using a Simulink system that integrates our VLC platform for inter-communications to simulates the performance of autonomous vehicles platoon.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535434","VLC;Platoon;ITS;Road safety applications","Optical transmitters;Receivers;Light emitting diodes;Vehicles;Safety;Prototypes;Lighting","free-space optical communication;mobile robots;optical filters;optical receivers;optical transmitters","visible light inter-vehicle communication;autonomous vehicles platooning;visible light communication;VLC;vehicular tail-lighting system;optical filter;receiver;transmitter;field-of-view;ambient noises;platooning control;Simulink system;inter-communications;distance 30 m;time 36 ms","","4","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main contribution of this work is the introduction of several simplifications which reduces the nonlinear optimization problem to a quadratic program and thus enables application in a vehicle demonstrator.

The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid. The adopted machine-learning approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Simulations of traffic scenarios are performed to compare the machine-learning with the model-based approach. The results are promising and could enable the real-time computation of POGs for vehicle safety applications. With this detailed modelling of uncertainties, crucial components in vehicle safety systems like criticality estimation and trajectory planning can be improved.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535556","","Vehicles;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Vehicle dynamics;Acceleration;Vehicle safety;Uncertainty","estimation theory;grid computing;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;road safety;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","probability estimation;predicted-occupancy grids;vehicle safety;machine learning;complex traffic scenario;traffic participants;POG;grid-based probabilistic representation;random forest algorithm;criticality estimation;trajectory planning","","2","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main cause is human error in recognition and decision making. Active safety systems have thus a great potential for increasing vehicle safety at intersections. They may issue warnings to the driver or assume control of the vehicle in critical situations. Most approaches in current research rely on the assumption that all vehicles at the intersection are controllable, and/or they can be coordinated by a central intersection manager. This paper considers the case of a single controllable ego vehicle surrounded by several uncontrollable target vehicles, without communication. Only a map with the current position and velocity of the target vehicles are assumed to be known, but no pre-defined crossing order is given. A Robust Model Predictive Control strategy is designed for finding safe gaps in the crossing traffic, and for planning optimal trajectories to maximize the ego vehicle's efficiency and driver comfort. It is shown that its performance can be enhanced by Affine Disturbance Feedback. The algorithm is tested in several simulation scenarios and implemented on a test vehicle for experimental validation.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535391","","Vehicles;TV;Safety;Trajectory;Acceleration;Predictive control;Brakes","collision avoidance;human factors;predictive control;road accidents;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles;robust control;trajectory control","collision avoidance system;car accidents;United States;human error;decision making;active safety systems;vehicle safety;vehicle control;single controllable ego vehicle;uncontrollable target vehicles;target vehicle velocity;target vehicle position;robust model predictive control strategy;optimal trajectory planning;crossing traffic;affine disturbance feedback","","10","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents topological localization methods by matching the visual cues from the on-board monocular camera images and the preprocessed database. We propose two methods for vehicle localization. The first exploits the 3D information of the sparse visual cues from the database. The relative vehicle rotation and translation are extracted using SOREPP method which is able to handle challenging scenarios with extremely low inlier fractions. The translation length is selected among multiple triangulation candidates. In order to select the best candidate, we suggest a robust soft-threshold estimation method which is not prone to local maxima even when the inliers' fragment is very small. The other method seeks for a refined test vehicle position estimation using a soft-threshold on Sampson distances and Cross-ratio measurements given a current noisy vehicle pose and several near-by database images. This method does not require any 3D knowledge for operation. The main challenge our optimization algorithm addresses is due to the camera and scene configurations. The database images and the test image are all taken from positions which are approximately co-linear. In addition, the scene points visible in all these images are almost co-linear with the camera positions. In this configuration, standard localization algorithms will exhibit difficulties in obtaining accurate results. The novel algorithm we present here is able to overcome this problem. The suggested localization methods are initialized by a rough position estimation thus require a regular vehicle GPS on-board. A monocular camera is required for the topological localization. We evaluate the proposed methods on real data from the KITTI database with the RTK-GPS output as ground truth.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535493","","Vehicles;Databases;Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Estimation;Global Positioning System;Feature extraction","cameras;Global Positioning System;image matching;intelligent transportation systems;natural scenes;optimisation;pose estimation;traffic information systems;visual databases","lane-level positioning;sparse visual cues;vehicle localization;autonomous navigation;topological localization methods;visual cue matching;on-board monocular camera images;preprocessed database;3D information;relative vehicle rotation;relative vehicle translation;SOREPP method;translation length selection;robust soft-threshold estimation method;vehicle position estimation;Sampson distances;cross-ratio measurements;noisy vehicle pose;optimization algorithm;scene configurations;database images;camera positions;standard localization algorithms;rough position estimation;on-board vehicle GPS;KITTI database;RTK-GPS","","2","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Environmental sensing especially plays a vital role to achieve accurate obstacle detection. Unlike classical 2D scan, emerging 3D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors can scan dense point cloud at one time, which represents detailed information of urban environments. The downside of obstacle detection using 3D LiDAR, on the other hand, is its computational cost posed by a large amount of 3D data. The virtual scan (VScan), first introduced by Petrovskaya et al. [1] for efficient vehicle detection and tracking, is a 2D compression of 3D point cloud to represent free space, obstacles and unknown areas. To overcome the computational problem of obstacle detection using 3D LiDAR, therefore, VScan is suitable. In addition, it can bridge across new-born 3D LiDAR sensors and many matured applications based on 2D scan, including occupancy grid map, SLAM, planning, detection, and tracking, due to its 2D representation of 3D point cloud. A key challenge to VScan for intelligent vehicles is that we must improve robustness of VScan in complex urban environments. For example, steep ramps with large slope, low curbs along the road, and overhung barrier gates at the entrance often make VScan mis-behave. In this paper, we present a robust VScan generation method for intelligent vehicles driving in complex urban environments. Our method uses a new data structure, called basic VScan matrix (BVSM), to represent 3D point cloud around the own vehicle. We also develop (i) a simultaneous road filtering and obstacle detection method that works on top of BVSM to generate robust VScan generation, and (ii) a sorted array based acceleration method to perform the VScan generation in real-time. Experimental results from field testing, where steep ramps, barrier gates, and curbs are contained, demonstrate that our method improves the robustness and the speed of VScan generation as compared to traditional methods. The computational cost of generating VScan with 2000 beams is limited within 15ms. The result of obstacle detection on the road with large slopes is stable in the range of 60m with a few number of false positives.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535461","","Roads;Three-dimensional displays;Automotive electronics;Robustness;Urban areas;Laser radar;Two dimensional displays","collision avoidance;data structures;image filtering;image representation;intelligent transportation systems;object detection;optical radar","robust virtual scan;intelligent vehicle;environmental sensing;3D light detection and ranging sensor;3D LiDAR sensor;dense point cloud;vehicle detection;vehicle tracking;3D point cloud compression;free space representation;obstacle representation;occupancy grid map;SLAM;steep ramps;road curbs;overhung barrier gates;complex urban environment;data structure;basic VScan matrix;BVSM;road filtering;obstacle detection method;sorted array based acceleration method","","3","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the integrated ACC controller that optimizes the switching between throttle and brake is designed. The ACC system, which consists of the continuous-time vehicle longitudinal dynamics (throttle and brake models) and the discrete-event dynamics (logic switching rule between throttle and brake), is modeled in Mixed Logic Dynamical (MLD) approach. Then the ACC controller is designed in Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, and the requirements of spacing control, rear-end collision avoidance (safety), optimal switching between throttle and brake, and vehicle capabilities are considered as the control objectives and constraints, respectively. In MPC framework, the ACC controller design is finally transformed to an online Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP).

In order to define behavioral requirements for future autonomous vehicles, an understanding of these interactions is needed. Therefore this paper analyzes the interaction between drivers and pedestrians at crosswalks from both the driver's and the pedestrian's perspective. A study with driving experiments in real-life traffic was conducted. The study not only investigates how drivers respond to pedestrians who intend to use the crosswalk, but also their response to pedestrians who waive their right-of-way. An analysis of recorded driving and video data identified typical behavior patterns of drivers approaching a crosswalk, as well as of pedestrians crossing on it. Supplemented by questionnaires filled in by drivers and pedestrians, we determined factors which have a relevant impact on successful driver-pedestrian interaction. We confirmed that with higher initial speeds, drivers tend to exhibit more anticipatory driving behavior. Contrary to previous studies, the presented results show a significant influence of the vehicle's speed on the pedestrian's decision process. The gained insights into the driver-pedestrian interaction process provide an opportunity to develop autonomous driving functions with a cooperative driving behavior that conforms to the expectations of both pedestrians and vehicle occupants.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535361","","Vehicles;Urban areas;Roads;Legged locomotion;Global Positioning System;Schedules;Intelligent vehicles","automobiles;behavioural sciences computing;mobile robots;pedestrians;road accidents;road safety;road vehicles","driver-pedestrian interaction analysis;crosswalks;urban environments;traffic safety;road users;behavioral requirements;autonomous vehicles;recorded driving video data;anticipatory driving behavior;driver-pedestrian interaction process;autonomous driving functions;cooperative driving behavior","","12","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Map-based approaches play a fundamental role in the representation of vehicle surroundings, allowing several perception features, such as obstacle detection or road classification. However, benchmarks available in literature do not allow to evaluate the accuracy of these discrete representations, focusing only on the results downstream the maps. The proposed system uses a stochastic approach to evaluate a generic discrete representation of a three-dimensional world.

This paper proposes a fusion framework in which cooperative positioning information is fused with on-board radar sensor data. The measurement runs recorded on a highway and a rural road, demonstrate that the fusion of both information sources outperforms the positioning estimation using solely the radar sensor.

The approach uses a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) for modeling the individual object paths; collision risk is subsequently computed by an intersection operation. More specifically, the proposed DBN consists of two subgraphs for modeling pedestrian and vehicle path, respectively. They consist of latent states on top of Switching Linear Dynamical Systems (SLDSs) to anticipate changes in object dynamics. The pedestrian and vehicle-related sub-graphs contain latent states to model whether the pedestrian has seen the oncoming vehicle, and conversely, whether the driver has seen the pedestrian (associated measurements involve the respective head orientations). The pedestrian-related sub-graph furthermore contains a latent state modeling whether the pedestrian is at the curbside or not. Finally, a latent state is shared by the two sub-graphs, which models the potential motion coupling (i.e. at full awareness of the other traffic participant). We consider the scenario of a crossing pedestrian, who might stop or continue walking at the curb, in combination with an approaching vehicle, that might stop or continue driving. In experiments we illustrate that with the proposed approach, a more anticipatory driver warning and/or vehicle control strategy can be implemented.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535425","","Vehicles;Superluminescent diodes;Vehicle dynamics;Context;Dynamics;Switches;Couplings","automobiles;Bayes methods;collision avoidance;driver information systems;graph theory;image capture;network theory (graphs);pedestrians;road safety","vehicle control strategy;anticipatory driver warning;crossing pedestrian;motion coupling;latent state modeling;head orientations;vehicle-related subgraphs;pedestrian-related subgraphs;object dynamics;SLDS;switching linear dynamical systems;vehicle path modeling;pedestrian path modeling;intersection operation;object path modeling;DBN;dynamic Bayesian network;spatial layout;potential motion coupling degree;mutual situational awareness;vehicle-pedestrian collision risk analysis;pedestrian awareness-based collision risk analysis;driver awareness-based collision risk analysis","","8","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, path planning for more complex maneuvers at low speeds, especially in tight and cluttered environments, remains a difficult challenge. This paper proposes a new approach to this problem.

Accounting for over one-third of all intersection crashes, straight crossing path (SCP) crashes are the most common intersection crash mode. Intersection Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (I-ADAS) have the potential to prevent SCP crashes by detecting imminent collisions and either alerting the driver and/or taking autonomous crash avoidance action. The objective of this study was to estimate how many SCP intersection crashes could be potentially prevented in the U.S. if every vehicle was equipped with I-ADAS. Three steps were performed in this study. First, a simulation case set was generated from 459 real world SCP intersection crashes collected as part of NHTSA's National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey (NMVCCS) database. Second, the pre-crash kinematics of each vehicle was reconstructed using information from the crash investigation, pre-crash driver models, and reconstructed impact speeds. Third, the crashes were simulated as if both vehicles had been equipped with I-ADAS. Three critical time-to-collision (TTC) thresholds were evaluated in this study, including 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 seconds. The model predicted that 19% to 35% of all SCP crashes have the potential to be prevented if all vehicles in the U.S. were equipped with I-ADAS. Nearly twice as many crashes were predicted to be prevented if a TTC threshold of 3.0 s was used rather than 2.0 s. When at least one of the vehicles stopped prior to entering the intersection, the model estimated that 24% to 49% of crashes have the potential to be prevented by I-ADAS. In contrast, when neither vehicle stopped, the model estimates that 13% to 17% of crashes could potentially be prevented. It is important to note that the model makes several assumptions that represent a “best case scenario” for I-ADAS. These results have important implications for designers, consumers, and regulatory agencies.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535532","","Vehicles;Vehicle crash testing;Computer crashes;Kinematics;Acceleration;Databases;Sensors","accident prevention;collision avoidance;driver information systems","TTC thresholds;time-to-collision thresholds;crash simulation;vehicle pre-crash kinematics;NMVCCS database;NHTSA's National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey;I-ADAS-equipped vehicle;SCP intersection crashes;autonomous crash avoidance action;collision detection;SCP crash prevention;intersection crash mode;United States;straight crossing path crashes;intersection advanced driver assistance system;preliminary potential crash prevention estimates","","6","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A preceding vehicle look-ahead approach is adapted in the controller to maintain desired inter-vehicle distance. However, due to the position control of the look-ahead point, the follower vehicle may cut corners on turns. In this paper, the extension of a look-ahead point that is able to compensate the cutting-corner behavior is then proposed. To validate the theoretical analysis, the full nonlinear system together with the developed controller is simulated for two scenarios, a circular path and a particular path scenario, and a comparison is made between the system with the preceding vehicle look-ahead and the extended look-ahead.

In contrast to most previous studies, this work focusses on analytical derivations. To this end, the Cramér-Rao bound of the best attainable state estimation covariance is derived from a model of sensor measurement errors.

For this reason we do not estimate a full homography matrix but reduce the parameter space to two parameters. In this area of parameter estimation there are mainly two different approaches: The optical flow based approach and the image registration based approach. In order to decide which of these approaches is more favorable for the angle estimation problem, we develop one optical flow based and one image registration based angle estimation algorithm. We are the first directly evaluating and comparing both approaches with each other with the help of an artificial image sequence as well as real-world driving scenarios.

However, they are primarily designed for lidar applications or omit the additional Doppler information of radars. Classical radar based tracking methods using the Doppler information are mostly designed for point tracking of parallel traffic. The measurement model presented in this paper is developed to track vehicles of approximately rectangular shape in arbitrary traffic scenarios including parallel and cross traffic. In addition to the kinematic state, it allows to determine and track the geometric state of the object. Using the Doppler information is an important component in the model.

Concretely, this work details the practical deployment of a new adaptive channel estimation method in the context of IEEE 802.11p based vehicular communications. The development steps are illustrated and some challenges involved by real-world deployment (e.g. the phase tracking problem) are treated. Consequently, practical methods to solve the observed impairments are derived and implemented for real-time operation and validation.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535356","Vehicular networks;Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM);channel estimation;IEEE 802.11p receiver;SDR;GNURadio","OFDM;Channel estimation;Signal to noise ratio;Software;Hardware;Software algorithms;Real-time systems","channel estimation;intelligent transportation systems;mobile communication;software radio","IEEE802.11p channel estimators;GNURadio;Intelligent Transportation Systems;ITS;wireless access in vehicular environments algorithms;WAVE algorithms;software defined radio;SDR;adaptive channel estimation method;vehicular communications","","1","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Finding such latent behavior requires provoking it and recognizing its occurrence. Prior research has made progress on the first part, but for the identification it concentrates on single undesired states. This paper applies temporal logic to a search graph created by dynamic analysis. This way it directly tests the planning and control software instead of an abstraction that is suited for formal verification. Two approaches, one using NuSMV, the other one using small automata are evaluated and compared. NuSMV offers the power of Computation Tree Logic, while the second approach is fast enough to interactively specify undesired event sequences.

To achieve a full automation, self-driving cars need a precise localization module. Most of existing localization approaches consist of two main steps: map generation and actual localization that uses the map obtained at the first step. The localization quality of a system directly depends on the capabilities of its sensors, the quality of a map, as well as correctness and effectiveness with which a localization method uses new observations. Therefore, to provide the best results, such systems are equipped with ever-increasing number of sensors. However, extraction of relevant information from sensor data is still challenging. This paper focuses on two localization components: landmark tracking and fusion. We consider landmarks corresponding to poles and road surface markings. They are extracted from the data provided by four fisheye cameras placed around a car and a front lidar. Detection of landmarks depends on characteristics of a sensor: its quality, delay (time), and output rate (frequency). Therefore, we have developed a tracking and fusion module based on the Sequential Probability Ratio Test which is used for both map generation and localization steps. This module was evaluated in a number of driving tests and the results showed high map quality and low localization error.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535394","","Roads;Automobiles;Estimation;Target tracking;Sensor systems;Sensor phenomena and characterization","automobiles;cameras;image fusion;intelligent transportation systems;optical radar;probability;statistical testing","multisensor tracking;SPRT;autonomous vehicle;automated driving;self-driving cars;information extraction;localization components:;landmark tracking;landmark fusion;road surface markings;poles;fisheye cameras;front lidar;landmark detection;sensor characteristics;output rate;sequential probability ratio test;localization error","","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm estimates the six degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) of the transformation from the vehicle coordinate system to the coordinate system of the stereo camera and at the same time the relative 6-DoF transformation between the two camera sensors. Salient points in the environment that are observed by both cameras are tracked over time in 3D space. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied to recursively estimate the extrinsic stereo camera calibration and the 3D position of all observed points. The projections of the points and the measured vehicle motion, which is estimated using an inertial measurement unit (IMU), are given as input. The observability of the stereo camera calibration states is analyzed to identify critical vehicle motion sequences.

Estimating the depth at nighttime is generally challenging as the night images are dark and noisy and the estimated depth information is not accurate. In our proposed work, we modify the non-local means filter and propose a new non-local cost function to combine the noise reduction and stereo vision within a single framework.

The proposed system reacts not only to the actual driving hazards, but also to the upcoming hazards the human operator is not aware of because of time delay. For this purpose, it predicts the future trajectories of dynamic objects in the vehicle surroundings using a stereo vision based track-before-detect approach and reacts autonomously to the predicted hazards through speed control. After each intervention, the human operator is informed about the autonomous intervention of the vehicle by a Human-Machine-Interface (HMI), having the ability to override this intervention. Results of the test drives show an overall increase of the safety by reduction of Time-To-Collision as well as an improvement of the acceptance of teleoperated driving through the reduction of the overall triggered deceleration during driving in urban areas.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535381","Unmanned Ground Vehicle;Teleoperation;Collision Avoidance;EBA;Shared Control","Vehicles;Delay effects;Safety;Teleoperators;Trajectory;Vehicle dynamics;Workstations","delays;hazards;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;road safety;road traffic;stereo image processing;velocity control","predictive safety;track-before-detect;teleoperated driving;communication time delay;autonomous driving;mobility concept;safety hazards;stop-and-go driving behavior;human operator;driving hazards;stereo vision;speed control;human-machine-interface;HMI;time-to-collision","","2","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whilst such systems showed their capability to improve comfort and safety, most of them provide assistance only as a last resort, that is, they alert the driver or trigger automatic braking only when collision is imminent. This limitation is mainly due to the difficulty to accurately anticipate risk situations in order to provide the driver with preventive assistance, i.e. assistance allowing for comfortable reaction. This paper presents a Bayesian framework which aims to detect risk situations sufficiently early to trigger conventional curative assistance as well as preventive assistance. By taking into consideration the context, the vehicle state, the driver actuation and the manner how the driver usually negotiates given situations, the framework allows to infer which type of assistance is the most pertinent to be provided to the driver. The principles of this framework are applied to a fundamental case study, the arrival to a stop intersection. Results obtained from data recorded under controlled conditions are presented. They show that the framework allows to coherently detect risk situations and to identify what assistance, including preventive assistance, is the most appropriate for the situation.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535531","","Vehicles;Bayes methods;Trajectory;Acceleration;Roads;Brakes;Context","Bayes methods;driver information systems;risk analysis;road safety;road vehicles","Bayesian framework;preventive assistance;road intersections;advanced driving assistance systems;ADAS;automatic braking;risk situation detection;curative assistance;vehicle state;driver actuation","","2","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence, the multihop scheme allows every vehicle to estimate its own position collecting its cumulative distances to border vehicles.

For the activation of safety systems detailed information about the vehicles environment is necessary. Laser scanners provide precise information about the environment and a high angular resolution in contrast to radar sensors [1]. The performance of laser scanners depends on their local environment, because of the attenuation of the ambient atmosphere, precipitation and on the reflectivity of objects. False measurements in the field of vehicle safety can result in severe injury or death, so high reliability is essential. For this purpose a theoretical model is developed in order to determine the sensor behavior. Subsequently, a rain simulator is constructed to validate the theoretical model. Furthermore the developed rain simulator is validated by comparison with real rain. Based on determined rain disturbances benchmark tests of different sensor systems and algorithm approaches can be performed.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535399","","Rain;Mathematical model;Safety;Laser beams;Automotive engineering;Laser modes;Sensor systems","automotive electronics;optical scanners;optical sensors;radar receivers;reflectivity;road safety;road vehicles","automotive sensor systems;indoor test method;safety systems;vehicle environment;laser scanners;high angular resolution;radar sensors;ambient atmosphere;vehicle safety","","4","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Relying on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication links, one promising solution consists in performing distributed Cooperative Positioning (CP). More specifically, Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) broadcasts from neighboring vehicles (seen as “virtual anchors”) are used to exchange positional information and to measure V2V radiolocation metrics such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). For the sake of fusing these nonlinear hybrid data, Particle Filters (PFs) represent the required positional information by a set of particles with associated weights. However, in a jointly cooperative and distributed context, the transmission of explicit particle clouds (required by receiving neighbors to update their own location estimates) is hardly affordable under limited V2V channel capacity with typical numbers of particles. In this paper we thus combine and compare several solutions in terms of message representation and adaptive transmission policy so as to reduce simultaneously CAM overhead, channel congestion and computational complexity. Proposals are made at both signal processing level (parametric density approximation) and protocol level (jointly adaptive transmission payload, power and rate), showing no impact on channel load in congested scenarios and negligible CP accuracy degradation in comparison with standard CAM transmission at critical rates.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535358","","Global Positioning System;Computer aided manufacturing;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Automobiles;Dispersion;Loss measurement","access protocols;Global Positioning System;particle filtering (numerical methods);radio direction-finding;RSSI;signal processing;vehicular ad hoc networks","GPS-aided VANET;communication aspects;particle-based cooperative positioning;intelligent transport systems;vehicle-to-vehicle communication links;cooperative awareness message;CAM;virtual anchors;V2V radiolocation metrics;received signal strength indicator;RSSI;nonlinear hybrid data;particle filters;explicit particle clouds;message representation;adaptive transmission policy;channel congestion;computational complexity;signal processing level;protocol level","","10","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a novel real-time detection algorithm for driver cognitive distraction by using support vector machine (SVM). Data are collected from 26 subjects, driving in typical urban and highway scenarios in a simulator. The chosen urban scenario is the stop-controlled intersection and the highway scenario is the speed-limited highway. Driver cognitive distraction while driving is induced by clock tasks which compete with the main driving tasks for visuospatial short working memory. For each subject, distracted driving instances and the equal number of non-distracted driving instances were collected (24 for urban scenario and 20 for highway scenario in total). Features concerning both driving performance and eye movement are used for training and validation. The proposed algorithm have correct rate of 93.0% and 98.5% for highway and urban scenarios respectively.

Interference comes from natural and predatory sources in the form of increased in-band noise and structured attacks. The structured attack, called spoofing, is designed to trick the receiver into reporting an incorrect navigation solution as if it were accurate. Modern automobiles are becoming more reliant on GPS for localization, automation, and safety. Vehicles are also equipped with a variety of sensors (e.g. Radars, Lidars, wheel encoders) that provide situational awareness which may be leveraged in a GPS spoofing detection scheme. The proposed spoofing detection and mitigation system relies on an existing Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) system to provide inter-vehicle ranging and data sharing. The inter-vehicle ranges are used to detect a spoofing attack, and the mitigation system removes the attacking signal from the incoming data stream. The spoofing detection and removal system is tested using data recorded with a fielded CACC system on two commercial trucks. Intermediate frequency (IF) GPS data is collected during the test. Since live sky spoofing is legal, the IF data recording allows for post process spoofing injection in a controlled environment. In post process, the spoofing signal is shown to “capture” the onboard GPS receiver. The proposed system uses the spoofed IF GPS data along with recorded observables from the CACC system to detection and remove the attack.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535525","","Receivers;Global Positioning System;Vehicles;Satellites;Cruise control;Adaptive systems;Delay effects","adaptive control;adaptive signal detection;cooperative communication;Global Positioning System;intelligent transportation systems;radio receivers;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication network reliability","Global Positioning System;GPS spoofing detection scheme;GPS spoofing mitigation;cooperative adaptive cruise control system;CACC system;Global Navigation Satellite Systems;GNSS;electronic interference;intervehicle ranging;intervehicle data sharing;intermediate frequency GPS data;GPS receiver","","2","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore we explicitly take arbitrary road geometry and prediction information of other traffic participants into account. We extend former contributions in this field by providing a flexible problem description and a trajectory planner without specialization to distinct classes of maneuvers beforehand. Using a carefully chosen representation of the dynamic free space, the method is capable of considering multiple lanes including the predicted dynamics of other traffic participants, while being real-time capable at the same time.

Values of BRT range from 0.47s to 2.13s with a mean of 1.016s and a standard deviation of 0.3875s. Influence of seven factors on BRT is analyzed using one-way Analysis of Variance and path analysis. Factors include occurrence time of near-crash, visibility, number of potential threat vehicles, intersection or not, road type, moving status and velocity of the vehicle. The results show that visibility, intersection or not and number of potential threat vehicles are significant factors. Better visibility in the darkness can significantly shorten BRT. BRT decreases with the increase of potential threat vehicles. However, when there are too many (more than three) potential threat vehicles ahead, drivers show significantly longer BRT.

In order to better understand the relationship between cognitive load and the driver performance in a partially autonomous vehicle, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures were employed to study the activation of the prefrontal cortex of drivers in a simulated environment. We studied a total of 14 participants while they drove a partially autonomous car and performed common secondary tasks. We observed that when participants were asked to monitor the driving of an autonomous car they had low cognitive load compared to when the same participants were asked to perform a secondary reading or video watching task on a brought in device. This observation was in line with the increased drowsy behavior observed during intervals of autonomous system monitoring in previous studies. Results demonstrate that fNIRS signals from prefrontal cortex indicate additional cognitive load during manual driving compared to autonomous. Such brain function metrics could be used with minimally intrusive and low cost sensors to enable real-time assessment of driver state in future autonomous vehicles to improve safety and efficacy of transfer of control.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535420","","Automobiles;Monitoring;Autonomous automobiles;Performance evaluation;Biomedical monitoring","computerised monitoring;infrared spectra;real-time systems;road safety;road vehicles","partially autonomous cars;driver cognitive load monitoring;functional near infrared spectroscopy;partially automated cars;driving control;partially autonomous vehicle;fNIRS signals;prefrontal cortex;simulated environment;secondary tasks;secondary reading;video watching;autonomous system monitoring;real-time assessment;driver state","","8","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, assistance systems that warn drivers if their distraction poses a hazard to road safety, promise a great safety benefit. Current approaches either seek to detect critical situations using environmental sensors or estimate a driver's attention state solely from his/her behavior. However, this neglects that driving situation, driver deficiencies and compensation strategies altogether determine the risk of an accident. This work proposes to use inverse suboptimal control to predict these aspects in visually distracted lane keeping. In contrast to other approaches, this allows a situation-dependent assessment of the risk posed by distraction. Real traffic data of seven drivers are used for evaluation of the predictive power of our approach. For comparison, a baseline was built using established behavior models. In the evaluation our method achieves a consistently lower prediction error over speed and track-topology variations.

"Coping with non-recurring congestion with distributed hybrid routing strategy","M. Seredynski; A. Grzybek","Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology, Luxembourg; University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg","2016 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","","2016","","","1121","1127","In case of congestion drivers typically select an alternative route on the basis of the shortest travel time principle. However, if drivers are informed with the same traffic conditions, their routing decisions can create a new congestion on the alternative route. The simplest method to reduce the risk of such an event has drivers choose another route with a certain probability associated with the latest reported travel time on the route. Nevertheless, this method has two drawbacks. Firstly, it is efficient only during the congestion period. Secondly, it presumes that some drivers select a route which is not optimal from their point of view. In this paper we demonstrate that these drawbacks can be eliminated when a hybrid approach is used. That is, an in-vehicle system detects a period when capacity of a route is reduced, and only then it requests drivers to follow the probabilistic approach. Otherwise the conventional shortest-time principle is applied. Each vehicle acts as a traffic sensor, and travel times are disseminated by means of connected vehicle technology. In addition, a simple road user charging mechanism is used to motivate free-riders to select routes contributing to system optimum. System evaluation is carried out using realistic network (NS-3) and traffic (SUMO) simulations and a two-route example.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535530","","Vehicles;Roads;Routing;Probabilistic logic;Estimation;Oscillators;Data collection","probability;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","nonrecurring congestion;distributed hybrid routing strategy;shortest travel time principle;traffic condition;travel times;connected vehicle technology;road user charging mechanism;probabilistic approach","","2","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a strategy to use road markings as localization landmarks for vision based systems. First step consists in reconstructing a map of road marks. A mobile mapping system equipped with precise georeferencing devices is applied to scan the scene in 3D and to generate an ortho-image of the road surface. A RJMCMC sampler that is coupled with a simulated annealing method is applied to detect occurrences of road marking templates instanced from an extensible database of road mark patterns. The detected objects are reconstructed in 3D using the height information obtained from 3D points. A calibrated camera and a low cost GPS receiver are embedded on a vehicle and used as localization devices. Local bundle adjustment (LBA) is applied to estimate the trajectory of the vehicle. In order to reduce the drift of the trajectory, images are matched with the reconstructed road marks frequently. The matching is initialized by the initial poses that are estimated by LBA and optimized by a MCMC algorithm. The matching provides ground control points that are integrated in the LBA in order to refine the pose parameters. The method is evaluated on a set of images acquired in a real urban area and is compared with a precise ground-truth.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535501","","Roads;Three-dimensional displays;Cameras;Two dimensional displays;Vehicles;Mobile communication;Global Positioning System","cameras;computer vision;driver information systems;embedded systems;geographic information systems;Global Positioning System;image matching;image reconstruction;image sampling;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;natural scenes;pose estimation;simulated annealing","landmark based localization;LBA refinement;MCMC-optimized projections;RJMCMC-extracted road marks;driver assistance systems;vision based systems;road mark map reconstruction;mobile mapping system;georeferencing devices;3D scene;ortho-image generation;road surface;simulated annealing method;road marking template occurrence detection;road mark pattern database;object detection;height information;low cost GPS receiver;calibrated camera;local bundle adjustment;LBA;vehicle trajectory estimation;trajectory drift reduction;image matching;initial pose estimation;pose parameter refining;reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler","","4","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The task planner decides a sequence of actions to accomplish the driving mission taking into consideration traffic rules and semantic conditions. The motion planner generates detailed trajectories to execute the tasks. Meanwhile, the task sequence and the motion trajectory are verified periodically against the actual traffic situation, and re-planning is triggered when necessary in the motion planning or task planning level.

In this novel service, the transmission of video and audio streams of the vehicle surroundings via wireless networks to the taxi dispatch center allows a human operator to remotely sense the environment through a virtual windshield and to remotely operate the vehicle controls through an emulated cockpit. This safe and cost-effective transport service merges together aspects of taxi transport with car sharing services if the passenger drives part of the route. A large-scale empirical evaluation study proves the feasibility of this novel taxi operation mode and shows that the implementation of the system can reduce, on average, the number of drivers to between 15% and 27% when considering teleoperation during pickup/dropoff and service, respectively. A premium service where passengers are remotely also driven from their origin to the destination also presents considerable gains for taxi operators.

But the near-road area may also contain traversable shoulders and medians, such that a road departure can be a fully safe and recoverable event. This paper presents a simulated road departure warning system, sensitive to severity of hazards based on near-road terrain geometry analysis and subsequent threat assessment. To serve as a demonstration, many random 3D models of a highway road and near-road features following AASHTO guidelines were generated. Near-road features were subdivided into three categories corresponding to high, medium or low severity based on their geometries. We assume that geometric parameters of features used in this study are available from pre-processed LIDAR or other map data. Due to unavailability of threat correlation between different types of features, a relative threat index defined as Normalized Average Severity index is used to determine threats associated with a feature. To simulate a driver-warning system, geometries and hazards were tagged with different colors on the generated 3D model. The 3D model is designed to serve as an additional visual warning system for the driver providing information about risk zones nearby the present vehicle position.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535545","","Vehicles;Roads;Geometry;Vehicle crash testing;Alarm systems;Solid modeling","driver information systems;hazards;image processing;optical radar;road accidents;road safety","variable-sensitivity road departure warning system;static road threats;mapped road threats;near-road threats;collision hazard;rollover threats;frontal impact hazards;high-speed road recovery;simulated road departure warning system;near-road terrain geometry analysis;highway road random 3D models;AASHTO guidelines;preprocessed LIDAR;relative threat index;normalized average severity index;driver-warning system;visual warning system","","2","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study was aiming to investigate possibility of employing a consumer grade wearable device to measure physiological parameters related to cognitive workload in real-time while driving i.e., drivers' heart rate. Furthermore, validity of captured heart activity metrics was analyzed to determine if wearable devices could be embedded into driving at its current technological state. The driving context was reproduced in desktop driving simulator, with 14 participants agreeing to take part in the study (μ = 28, σ = 8.5 years).

However, VO still suffers from the problem of drift. In this paper, a novel Turning Point Filtering (TPF) algorithm is proposed to restrain the VO's drift by inducing the constraint from a concise road map. Different from the traditional road map based methods, we believe the simple “edge-node” road map is not enough to well model the true trajectory of the vehicle. Therefore our method does not enforce the corrected trajectory exactly on the edges of the map. A flexible turning point filtering mechanism is designed under a particle filter framework to well balance the information from the VO and the road map. The method features making reliable corrections only on the turning points of the trajectory, which adds little additional computation burden to VO. Experiments on various datasets including KITTI and the data acquired in our campus demonstrate the outperformance of our method.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535509","","Roads;Trajectory;Turning;Vehicles;Global Positioning System;Estimation;Filtering","computer vision;particle filtering (numerical methods)","KITTI datasets;trajectory turning points;particle filter framework;flexible turning point filtering mechanism;vehicle trajectory model;visual odometry;VO drift;TPF algorithm;vision-based localization method;road map;robust localization","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the coarse assessment, the algorithm selects a target vehicle with the highest possibility of collision by using fuzzy logic. In fine assessment, it determines collision probability based on a statistical approach considering driving maneuvers; it models the driving maneuvers to enable the driver to operate the vehicle in conditions toward the collision and calculates the collision probability as the ratio between the total driving maneuvers and the driving maneuvers in possible collisions. To reduce the simulation time complexity, we adapt a neural network. Since there exist variance of widths for different vehicles, we also apply neural network ensemble to cope with the variance.

Camera-based direct detection systems are able to reliably accomplish this task only within a limited spatial range or in simple environments, due to hardware limitations and unfavorable situations, like shadows or occlusions. In complex environments, like inner city, traffic is a real issue, since the mere presence of other cars can significantly restrict the field of view of the ego-vehicle. In order to extend the spatial range of road detection, indirect detection systems are a viable resource. They can complement state-of-the-art direct detection systems and help motion control systems to plan smooth and stable trajectories. In this paper we propose a probabilistic grid-based approach based on the interpretation of the motion of other vehicles in the scene. The approach uses the position and velocity of those vehicles in order to infer the presence and location of occluded road area. We will show that this approach can complement an already established feature-based detection system, taking advantage of those situations that are the most challenging for the latter. Evaluations on real-world scenes show that the union between this approach and direct road detection significantly extends the spatial range of detection, thus is able to provide a motion control system a longer horizon for planning trajectories.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535540","","Roads;Sensors;Visualization;Feature extraction;Automobiles;Motion control","control engineering computing;image representation;motion control;object detection;path planning;probability;road traffic","spatial road representation;traffic participants behavior;road area detection;ego-vehicle;ADAS;advanced driver assistance systems;camera-based direct detection systems;indirect detection systems;motion control systems;probabilistic grid-based approach;feature-based detection system;direct road detection;trajectories planning","","1","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many approaches rely on lane markers however, which limits the system to larger paved roads and poses problems during winter. In this work we explore an alternative approach to visual road following based on online learning. The system learns the current visual appearance of the road while the vehicle is operated by a human. When driving onto a new type of road, the human driver will drive for a minute while the system learns. After training, the human driver can let go of the controls. The present work proposes a novel approach to online perception-action learning for the specific problem of road following, which makes interchangeably use of supervised learning (by demonstration), instantaneous reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning (self-reinforcement learning). The proposed method, symbiotic online learning of associations and regression (SOLAR), extends previous work on qHebb-learning in three ways: priors are introduced to enforce mode selection and to drive learning towards particular goals, the qHebb-learning methods is complemented with a reinforcement variant, and a self-assessment method based on predictive coding is proposed. The SOLAR algorithm is compared to qHebb-learning and deep learning for the task of road following, implemented on a model RC-car. The system demonstrates an ability to learn to follow paved and gravel roads outdoors. Further, the system is evaluated in a controlled indoor environment which provides quantifiable results. The experiments show that the SOLAR algorithm results in autonomous capabilities that go beyond those of existing methods with respect to speed, accuracy, and functionality.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535377","","Roads;Visualization;Kernel;Learning systems;Training;Automobiles","control engineering computing;Hebbian learning;mobile robots;regression analysis;road vehicles;robot vision;traffic engineering computing;unsupervised learning","visual autonomous road following;driving assistance systems;autonomous driving;road visual appearance;online perception-action learning;learning by demonstration;instantaneous reinforcement learning;unsupervised learning;self-reinforcement learning;symbiotic online learning of associations and regression;SOLAR algorithm;qHebb-learning;self-assessment method;predictive coding;RC-car model;supervised learning","","1","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A driving experiment with a cross traffic obstacle appearing at different speeds and different times-to-collision (TTC) was performed on a test track.

In this work, we examine the possibilities for a Personalised ACC (PACC), which adapts the ACC settings such that it matches the driver preference in order to increase the acceptance. The driver preferred ACC behaviour is predicted using machine learning techniques and manual driving data. On-road experiments showed that the method is promising as it is able to discriminate between two preference clusters with an accuracy of 85%.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535544","","Feature extraction;Automobiles;Manuals;Cruise control;Training;Adaptive systems","adaptive control;behavioural sciences computing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;road vehicles;sensors;traffic engineering computing","personalised automated driving;ACC behaviour prediction;manual driving;adaptive cruise control;ACC systems;advanced driver assistance systems;ADAS application;sensor input;user preferences;personalised ACC;PACC;ACC settings;driver preference;machine learning techniques;manual driving data","","5","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In oder to handle such cases, in this paper, as a variation of the Deformable Part Model (DPM) which is widely used in the field of object recognition, we propose “Parts Selective DPM (PS-DPM)” which selectively chooses the original part filters and additional part filters trained independently. In the detection of pedestrians possessing an umbrella, the selection of head and umbrella parts will make pedestrian detection more robust to the occlusion. We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. As a result, pedestrian detection with the proposed PS-DPM achieved high detection accuracy in rainy weather, compared with the detection by the conventional DPM.

This paper deals with the modeling of advanced driving maneuvers for the FDM with a special focus on lateral positioning scenarios, such as lane changes in highway traffic. When driving at high speeds, tactical preparation for a safe lane change is of high importance. In this context, the paper presents maneuvers that allow for lane changes to be planned well in advance and carefully made without the restraint of requiring immediate action. Furthermore, the paper presents a continuous lateral control which allows driving on arbitrary paths other than the centerline, depending on the current traffic situation. Since more complex lateral maneuvers require more detailed considerations of the environment, an approach is presented to model the lane and the environmental influences. This paves the way for a modeling of variables such as lane markings, roadblocks, hard shoulders and more. Simulations illustrate how the introduced maneuvers allow successful preparation for upcoming lane changes and how traffic obstructions can be bypassed without performing a lane change but by using the continuous lateral control.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535384","","Vehicles;Trajectory;Frequency division multiplexing;Adaptation models;Cost function;Predictive models;Computational modeling","motion control;road traffic control","traffic obstructions;lane markings;tactical preparation;highway traffic;lateral positioning scenarios;advanced driving maneuver modeling;microscopic driver model;FDM;continuous lateral control;tactical lane change;foresighted driver model","","1","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, a trustworthy lane change assistance system is supposed to provide support to the driver during a lane change maneuver by adapting to the state of the driver's uncertainty about distance gaps and closing speeds in respect to the surrounding traffic. The precondition for such a system is a model of driver's uncertainty, which can be used to recognize driver's uncertainty states in lane change situations. This paper mainly presents the development of a probabilistic model for classifying driver's uncertainty in lane change situations.

Pedestrian attributes such as body poses, face orientations and open umbrella are meant action or state of pedestrian. In general, this information is recognized using independent classifiers for each task. Performing all of these separate tasks is too time-consuming at the testing stage. In addition, the processing time increases with the number of tasks. To address this problem, multi-task learning or heterogeneous learning is able to train a single classifier to perform multiple tasks. In particular, heterogeneous learning is able to simultaneously train regression and recognition tasks, because reducing both training and testing time. However, heterogeneous learning tends to result in a lower accuracy rate for classes with a few training samples. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the performance of heterogeneous learning for such classes. We introduce a rarity rate based on the importance and class probability of each task. The appropriate rarity rate is assigned to each training sample. Thus, the samples in a mini-batch for training a deep convolutional neural network are augmented by this rarity rate to focus on the class with a few samples. Our heterogeneous learning approach with the rarity rate attains better performance on pedestrian attribute recognition, especially for classes representing open umbrellas.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535405","","Training;Face;Face recognition;Vehicles;Neural networks;Estimation;Testing","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pedestrians;probability","pedestrian attribute recognition;minibatch training;rarity rate;advanced driver assistance system;ADAS;multitask learning;heterogeneous learning;classifier training;probability;deep convolutional neural network","","3","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, individual alertness requests to verify the take-over and reaction ability of the driver during the automated phase were included in the framework. The basis of the evaluation was a realistic driving simulator study with 18 participants and long monotonous drives (Mean: 2:51 +/- 0:18 h) with the majority of the drive being conditionally automated. The data showed a significant difference in the behavioral indicators (eye closure and head movement) between drivers driving manually or conditionally automated, independently of their current drowsiness state.

In our first study, adult participants (N=40) experienced a simulated driving scenario that varied the behavior of the car's automation (perfect driving and imperfect driving) and the intervention modalities (takeover and takeover+influence). At certain segments, the car's automation would drive perfectly or weave within the lane. During those times, participants could intervene using the available modalities. When experiencing instances of imperfect driving, drivers who had the ability to takeover+influence intervened more often than drivers who were only given the option to takeover. As intervening would require them to resume full control, drivers in the takeover condition were more tolerant of the imperfect driving. Also, most drivers tried to intervene initially by influencing the car, even those drivers who were only given the ability to takeover. In our second study, we examined how participants (N=40) of different demographics (high school students and seniors) would respond when they were subjected to the imperfect driving scenarios. High school drivers intervened just as much as the adult drivers. However, senior drivers intervened far less. These two studies suggest that when intervention is necessary, human drivers have a desire for shared control, which allows them to act as supervisors rather than operators of automated vehicles.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535567","","Automation;Automobiles;Roads;Wheels;Weaving;Sensors","automobiles;demography","driver intervention;automated driving systems;simulated driving scenario;intervention modalities;demographics;imperfect driving scenarios;high school drivers;senior drivers;shared control","","6","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Starting with the original definition of the Mahalanobis distance we review its use in association. Given that there is no principle in multi-object tracking that sets the Mahalanobis distance apart as a distinguished statistical distance we revisit the global association hypotheses of multiple hypothesis tracking as the most general association setting. Those association hypotheses induce a distance-like quantity for assignment which we refer to as association log-likelihood distance. We compare the ability of the Mahalanobis distance to the association log-likelihood distance to yield correct association relations in Monte-Carlo simulations. Here, we use a novel method to generate multi-track scenarios that make the association evaluation independent of a specific track management scheme. We also explore the influence of the term proportional to the measurement dimension in the association log-likelihood distance on the assignment performance. It turns out that on average the distance based on association log-likelihood performs better than the Mahalanobis distance, confirming that the maximization of global association hypotheses is a more fundamental approach to association than the minimization of a certain statistical distance measure.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535395","","Radar tracking;Covariance matrices;Density measurement;Time measurement;Noise measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Minimization","minimisation;Monte Carlo methods;object tracking;statistical analysis","association log-likelihood distance;measurement-to-track association;Mahalanobis distance;multiobject trackers;Monte-Carlo simulations;association evaluation;track management;measurement dimension;global association hypothesis maximization;statistical distance measure","","1","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such a cascade system, classification accuracy is often affected by the detection results. This paper proposes a method for extracting a salient region of traffic sign within a detection window for more accurate sign representation and feature extraction, hence enhancing the performance of classification. In the proposed method, a superpixel-based distance map is firstly generated by applying a signed geodesic distance transform from a set of selected foreground and background seeds. An effective method for obtaining a final segmentation from the distance map is then proposed by incorporating the shape constraints of signs. Using these two steps, our method is able to automatically extract salient sign regions of different shapes. The proposed method is tested and validated in a complete TSR system. Test results show that the proposed method has led to a high classification accuracy (97.11%) on a large dataset containing street images. Comparing to the same TSR system without using saliency-segmented regions, the proposed method has yielded a marked performance improvement (about 12.84%).

First we investigate the variance of the reprojection error on the 3D position of a feature given a fixed error in pose change to conclude that a detection of outliers based on a fixed threshold on the reprojection error is inappropriate. Then we propose an optical flow dependent feature-adaptive scaling of the reprojection error to reach almost invariance to the 3D position of each feature. This feature-adaptive scaling is derived from an approximation showing the relation between longitudinal pose change of the camera, absolute value of the optical flow, and distance of the feature. Using this scaling, we develop an iterative alternating scheme to guide the separation of inliers from outliers. It optimizes the tradeoff between finding a good criterion to remove outliers based on a given pose change and improving the pose change hypothesis based on the current set of inliers. Including the new outlier removal scheme into a pure two-frame stereo-based visual odometry pipeline without applying bundle adjustment or SLAM-filtering we are currently ranked amongst the top camera-based algorithms and furthermore outperform camera and laser scanner methods in Kitti benchmark's high-speed scenarios.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535429","","Visualization;Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Adaptive optics;Bars;Measurement uncertainty","automotive engineering;distance measurement;image sequences;iterative methods;stereo image processing","laser scanner methods;camera-based algorithms;SLAM-filtering;bundle adjustment;two-frame stereo-based visual odometry pipeline;iterative alternating scheme;optical flow dependent feature-adaptive scaling;outlier detection;feature 3D position;reprojection error;stereo-based visual odometry;outlier removal scheme;high-speed automotive applications","","11","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we propose a Hierarchical CNN (HCNN) which is inspired by a coarse-to-fine human learning methodology. For a given dataset, we introduce a CNN-oriented clustering algorithm to separate classes into K subsets, which are referred to as families. Then, the HCNN algorithm trains K+1 classification CNNs: one CNN for family classification and K dedicated CNNs corresponding to each family for member classification. We evaluate this HCNN approach on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), and achieve 99.67% correct detection rate (CDR), which is superior to the best reported results (99.46%) achieved by a single network.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535376","","Clustering algorithms;Training;Classification algorithms;Measurement;Partitioning algorithms;Standards;Neural networks","feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object recognition;pattern clustering;traffic information systems","hierarchical CNN;convolutional neural network;object classification;pattern recognition;image recognition tasks;coarse-to-fine human learning methodology;CNN-oriented clustering algorithm;HCNN algorithm;K+1 classification CNN training;German traffic sign recognition benchmark;GTSRB;correct-detection rate;CDR","","1","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this strategy is not common in multi sensor occupancy grid fusion. Thus, the quality of the fused grid, in terms of obstacle position accuracy, largely depends on the sensor with the lowest accuracy. In this paper an efficient method to associate obstacles across sensor grids is proposed. Imprecise sensors are discounted locally in cells where a more accurate sensor, that detected the same obstacle, derived free space. Furthermore, fixed discount factors to optimize false negative and false positive rates are used. Because of its generic formulation with the covariance of each sensor grid, the method is scalable to any sensor setup. The quantitative evaluation with a highly precise navigation map shows an increased obstacle position accuracy compared to standard evidential occupancy grid fusion.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7535396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7535396","","Laser radar;Standards;Fuses;Cameras;Automotive engineering;Radar cross-sections","collision avoidance;covariance analysis;driver information systems;navigation;object detection;sensor fusion","locally adaptive discounting;multisensor occupancy grid fusion;obstacle fusion algorithm;obstacle association;obstacle position;obstacle detection;multiple sensors;sensor grid covariance;navigation map","","2","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After that, the appearance information of vegetation or non-vegetation is encoded in the superpixel database. In the second stage, vegetation detection in each testing image is achieved by superpixel matching. The test image is segmented into superpixels and the (vegetation) label cost of each superpixel is derived by comparing with the k-nearest neighbors in the superpixel database. Furthermore, we incorporate the local context information through the feedback to refine superpixel matching. Taking this context information into account, Markov Random Field (MRF) is utilized to further improve the classification accuracy.

However, compared to the lane marking detection methods, detection of non-lane markings, such as text marks painted on the road, has been less studied so far. While some of methods for detecting non-lane markings exist, many of them are restricted to roadways only, or work poorly on AVM images.

Unfortunately all methodologies presented so far are laborious and time-consuming. We present here a novel sub-pixel disparity correction technique based on applying histogram matching through the use of generated Look-up Tables (LUTs). Our method is flexible, fast and produces more accurate results than previous solutions in the discrete domain. Although we show the improvements over the Semi-Global matching algorithm, it can be adapted to other matching algorithms that preserve constant misalignment for any kind of 3D scenarios. The proposed method was tested on multiple systems and datasets (Synthetic images, Traffic scenes, Middlebury images, KITTI images) and we show that we can find LUTs that outperform the accuracy of previous solutions on all these sets.

For this purpose, this study uses a symbolization method using a double articulation analyzer (DAA) assuming that NDD and human speech signals share an analogous structure, called a double articulation structure. The DAA can encode driving behavior data into sequences of driving words. However, the amount of semantic information contained in these sequences has not been clarified. Very few attempts have been made to develop a method for obtaining an adequate semantic representation of driving words that explains the relationship between different driving words. DW2V uses word2vec, proposed by Mikolov et al., to make a system learn the distributed semantic vector representation of symbolized naturalistic driving data (SNDD). Through experiments, we show that DW2V can restore the semantic relationships between different driving scenes from only a set of sequences of driving words, i.e., SNDD.

Thus, the accumulative error of the odometer is calibrated by the GNSS receivers and the autonomy of the on-board equipment is surely improved. In order to cope with the uncertainties in raw sensor measurements, the Bayesian filtering frame is adopted to obtain an accurate estimation of the train's state.

For map-based driving, a 3D laser scanner can be utilized to localize the vehicle within a previously recorded 3D map. Such scanners are however not feasible for mass production due to cost considerations. In this paper we present a localization algorithm that creates an off-line predefined map and then localizes with respect to this map. First, the map is constructed by a service vehicle equipped with a calibrated stereo camera rig and a high precision navigation system. Then, the global localization ego-pose can be obtained in any vehicle equipped with a standard GPS and a single forward looking camera for extracting and matching features to relevant map candidates. We use a recently proposed estimation method called SOREPP (Soft Optimization method for Robust Estimation based on Pose Priors) that utilizes relevant priors for achieving high performance, fast and reliable estimation, even with a small fraction of inliers. During the estimation it uses all the matched correspondences without need for random sampling to find the inliers. This method eventually obtains an outlier-free set of landmarks, used to estimate the ego-pose with high accuracy. We evaluate our algorithm on real world data comprised of a challenging 4.5km drive. Our algorithm achieves accurate localization results: a mean lateral absolute error of 14.35cm and a mean longitudinal absolute error of 18.63cm.","","978-1-5090-1821-5978-1-5090-1822","10.1109/IVS.2016.7587665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7587665","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
