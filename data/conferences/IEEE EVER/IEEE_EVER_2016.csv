These concepts use thermochemical heat storages to recover thermal energy from the powertrain waste heat and to re-use it for heating purpose before or during the drive. The focus will be on metal hydride storages, which have a higher specific energy density than the phase change energy storages and will thus be more advantageous for vehicle application. In order to investigate the developed waste heat recovery concepts in the entire vehicle, appropriate simulation models will be created in the simulation environment Modelica/Dymola, then integrated into an overall vehicle simulation model. It is found that the integration of the thermochemical heat storages into the fuel cell thermal management system leads to increase the range by up to 17 %.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476439","waste heat recovery;energy storage;fuel cell vehicle;thermochemical system;powertrain;thermal management","Heating;Fuels;Heat pumps;Vehicles;Magnetic circuits;Magnetoelectric effects;Waste heat","fuel cell vehicles;heat recovery;thermal energy storage;thermal management (packaging);waste heat;waste recovery","waste heat recovery;fuel cell electric vehicle;thermochemical energy storage;thermochemical heat storages;powertrain waste heat;metal hydride storages;energy density;phase change energy storages;Modelica;Dymola;vehicle simulation model;fuel cell thermal management system","","4","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is generally done by injecting a suitable demagnetizing current along the d axis. An alternative method has been recently proposed by the authors based on an Interior-Permanent-Magnet (IPM) synchronous motor equipped with a mechanical device which activates at high speeds by centrifugal force causing a significant reduction in the permanent magnet flux with no need for injecting d-axis stator currents. The performance of a road vehicle traction drive employing this machine under a maximum-torque-per-ampere control is investigated in this paper assuming a typical driving cycle. It is shown that remarkable benefits can be achieved in terms of energy saving, overload capability enhancement and speed range extension potential.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476372","Automotive;efficiency improvement;ecological vehicles;flux weakening;speed range extension;permanent magnet motor;spoke-type motor;vehicle traction","Vehicles;Mobile communication;Rotors;Permanent magnet motors;Gears;Performance evaluation;Permanent magnets","performance evaluation;permanent magnet motors;road vehicles;stators;synchronous motor drives;traction","performance evaluation;vehicle traction drive;mechanical flux weakening device;demagnetizing current;interior-permanent-magnet synchronous motor;centrifugal force;permanent magnet flux;road vehicle traction drive;maximum-torque-per-ampere control;driving cycle;energy saving;overload capability enhancement","","","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nanofluids function in oil well drilling is to modify rheological and heat transfer properties of the base fluid. Skin friction is reduced by nanofluids which in turn reduces drilling torque and the corresponding power consumption. This also mitigates wear on drilling equipments. The lubrication effects of nanofluids are achieved through enhanced surface energy absorption and ball bearing effects. Marsh Funnel is the practical method to measure viscosity of the drilling fluids with or without nanoparticles. The discharge time is the only measured parameter during operation. In this study, a new mathematical model is introduced for determining discharge flow rate of the Marsh Funnel. Results of the present method are validated against some available experimental data for Newtonian fluids. The present method can be equally applied for nanofluids. Marsh funnel volume discharge rate and the corresponding time are two important measureable parameters that can be used to determine different rheological parameters of nanofluids. The oil well drilling nanolubricants may be promising in an energy efficient operational environment.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476401","drilling fluids;Marsh Funnel;Newtonian fluid;rheological properties;sustainability","Energy measurement;Volume measurement;Time measurement;Adaptation models;Lubrication;Viscosity","drilling (geotechnical);energy conservation;friction;gas industry;heat transfer;mathematical analysis;nanofluidics;petroleum industry;power consumption;rheology;viscosity","mathematical modelling;Marsh funnel;rheological properties;drilling nanofluids;energy efficient environment;gas industry;oil industry;production rates;nanofluids function;heat transfer properties;drilling torque;power consumption;drilling equipments;wear;surface energy absorption;ball bearing effects;drilling fluids;discharge flow;Newtonian fluids;rheological parameters;oil well drilling nanolubricants;energy efficient operational environment","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the increasing share of volatile renewable energy sources, large energy storage systems are required to ensure the grid stability. This energy storage must be capable to provide short-term balancing power for the grid on demand. To meet the requirements stated above a distributed battery storage system based on lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cells has been developed. This storage system has been designed being able to realize other possible uses in addition to the necessary emergency power supply. However, for all additional applications and use cases the emergency power supply is always prior-ranked. Additional uses are for example the provision of balancing power as a service to the power grid, the increase of internal consumption of self-generated renewable energy (electricity is generated by photovoltaic plants during the day can be consumed by night). Furthermore, the storage system can be used as a charging station for electric vehicles.

There is lack of modelling to determine an optimized rated wind speed and no evidences are observed to suggest the best rated wind speed to produce maximum output power annually. For example in the market of small wind turbines, it is frequently observed that the rated wind speed is taken from small value of 8 m/s to large value of 20 m/s. To examine overall performance of these wind turbines, it is required to develop mathematical models to relate the annual power production of the wind turbines to the given rated wind speeds. By examining power curves of some small European wind turbines from 100 to 900 Watt with constant speed generators, a simplified mathematical model for power curves is introduced and combined with Weibull distribution of wind speeds. Results of the model based on a capacity factor are presented versus the rated wind speed using wind characteristics of an optional region. It is observed that between the cut-in and cut-out wind speeds, there is an optimum rated wind speed above which the annual output power production of the wind turbine remains unchanged.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476402","power performance;rated wind speed;Weibull distribution;wind energy;wind turbine","Mathematical model;Energy measurement;Power measurement;Wind turbines","Weibull distribution;wind;wind turbines","capacity factor;Weibull distribution;constant speed generators;power curves;annual power production;mathematical models;small wind turbines;best rated wind speed;optimized rated wind speed;rotor design procedure;velocity 8 m/s;velocity 20 m/s;power 100 W to 900 W","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, energy efficiency is one of the most important factors for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) because they are highly dependent on the aforementioned limitations. Hence, low-speed BEVs, which are for urban transportation, can be considered a promising solution. Also, a model-based design of a real low-speed EV is presented.

It is claimed that the new concept can significantly outperforms traditional wind turbines in terms of reducing the diameter of wind turbine, improve aerodynamic characteristics under the same wind conditions, and delivers significantly higher output at reduced cost. The innovative feature of the wind turbine is the elimination of tower-mounted turbines. It is believed that the entry of such systems is crucially important because external flows over nozzle or diffuse devices are different from classically known internal flows. Shrouded wind turbines and wind catcher systems are normally use a diffuser shape at entry, however, the INVELOX concept suggest using a nozzle at entry. In this paper, two different simpler systems than INVELOX are designed with nozzle or diffuser at the entry using general methods in design of blower wind tunnels. In the first phase of this work, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) method is applied to solve external flows around nozzle and diffuser flows by solving the modelled RANS (Reynolds average Navier-Stokes) equations.

Accounting for the armature magnetic reaction, the analytical model makes it possible the prediction of the developed force with emphasis on its synchronizing and reluctant components.

A Fuel Cell Control Unit (FCCU) was created to fulfil the stack working conditions on anode and cathode. To evaluate the system concept a test bench including all required components to run the FC-ESS was built up. Results about the thermal heat up process e.g. a thermal heat up gradient of 2 K/min using a 1.3 kW electric heater integrated in the Tri Ethylene Glycol filled thermal system were obtained. The fuel cell stack polarization curve was measured making a ramp measurement from 10 A to 50 A. Hydrogen purge loss was disclosed between 3...12 % on constant stack electric power set points varying between 1...3 kW leading to an overall measured electric efficiency higher than 46 %. Referring on real traction power demand measurements of a demonstrator car for NEDC, WLTP and a specific commuter cycle between Stuttgart (ST) and Lampoldshausen (LA), the requested hydrogen storage capacity for different working conditions of the FC-ESS was calculated using different power set points. It was shown that a 6 kW FC-ESS with 0.5 kg stored hydrogen mass could extend the range of an FC-ESS equipped electric car up to 200 kilometres on NEDC and 196 km on WLTP.

This HESS plays an important role in increasing the efficiency and the performance of EV due to the use of the advantages of each technology; the high density energy of the battery as well as the high power of the ultracapacitor. Moreover, batteries subjected to pulsed transient power generate dc voltages with dips that can exceed the voltage regulation band. So, it is revealed that this HESS can assist in maintaining the bus voltage within the regulatory limits, resulting in reduced system losses and prolonged power system life. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of a HESS which consists of an ultracapacitor placed in parallel with a battery, following the injection of constant power pulses.

A study of the stability of the closed-loop system shows the importance of taking into account the constraints of digital control (delay and discrete characteristics) in the calculation of decoupling terms and inverse Park transformation. The proposed decoupling is done using the discrete model of the system and a prediction of the evolution of the currents during the delay. The voltage, calculated by vector control, is applied to the machine by a three-phase voltage-source Power Width Modulation PWM converter. This voltage is modified because the rotor reference d-q frame turns during the delay and the switching period. The voltage error caused by this rotation can be significant at high speeds and more generally when the ratio of the switching frequency over the electrical output frequency becomes too high. To stabilize the system, we suggest predicting the average electric angle that the motor will have during the application of the voltage vector.

To remedy this situation, it is possible to use renewable energy to pump water and irrigate the fields. However, to optimize the energy exchange between the various components of such a system it is necessary to use an effective management strategy. This paper presents two power management strategies (PMSs) of an autonomous photovoltaic pumping system for agricultural applications.

This is particularly the case of tests at early stages in the development process or during fault simulation. However, the use of a HIL battery simulator requires the development of software (SW) and strategies for testing. While the possibilities are immense, it should be noted that the greater the level of complexity of the tests, the higher the demands for ad hoc development of SW and strategies. With regard to the latter, there is not a universal definition and there are different points of view. Therefore different strategies may be followed, which can be classified into many different ways according to the testing level, methods or processes. The aim of this paper is both to introduce the theoretical principles of BMS testing and to present a practical approach to develop ad hoc SW and strategies for BMS testing at system level on a commercial HIL simulator.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476438","Li-ion battery;energy storage;battery management system;HIL simulation;SW testing","Testing;Vehicles;Prototypes;Robustness","battery management systems;power engineering computing;secondary cells;software engineering","software development;battery management system testing;hardware-in-the-loop battery simulator;HIL battery simulator","","7","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, rail traction based upon hybrid technology is a very suitable solution for shunting locomotives, promising substantial benefits in terms of fuel savings, emissions and noise reductions. For instance, intensive tests carried out on various prototypes around the world demonstrated that the use of a hybrid locomotive, compared to a diesel equivalent with the same power, could save 40% to 70% of fuel, reduce NOx emissions up to 90%, reduce atmospheric particulate matter up to 70% and reduce CO2 emissions up to 60% while sulfur oxides would also decline. Significant reductions of noise and vibrations were also measured. Many companies have initiated projects on their own and developed prototypes but in most cases, information on these prototypes remains an industrial secret. To date, there is no unified approach or general theory for the hybrid traction principle applied to locomotives.

"Research on loss reduction of dual active bridge converter over wide load range for solid state transformer application","Qingshan Wang; D. Liang","Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xianning West Street, China; Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xianning West Street, China","2016 Eleventh International Conference on Ecological Vehicles and Renewable Energies (EVER)","","2016","","","1","9","This paper presents the design of new highfrequency transformer isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter modules connected in module-cascaded solid state transformer (SST). A phase-shift dual active bridge (DAB) converter is employed to achieve high-frequency galvanic isolation, bidirectional power flow, and zero voltage switching (ZVS) of all switching devices, which leads to low switching losses even with high-frequency operation. Bidirectional DC-DC converter is crucial to the power transmission in SST. The proposed DAB converter consists of two three-leg bridges and a high-frequency transformer with winding shunting taps. Furthermore, the commutation inductance connected in series with the transformer in the conventional DAB converter is integrated into the transformer windings, thus, enjoying smaller volume and higher power density. By changing the number of primary winding turns, leakage inductance, which is the key parameter in the energy transfer process of DAB converter, can be adjusted on a large scale, enabling the possibility of reducing loss over wide load range. Additionally, time-sharing circuit topology and operation mode are adopted to adapt to the output power by detecting the output current as the feedback. As a result, the efficiency at both light and heavy load can be significantly improved compared with the conventional DAB converter, and, therefore, high efficiency over wide load range and high power density can be achieved. Besides, the additional bridge arm structure along with a flexible control scheme provides possible high-level fault tolerance. Finally, the simulation results on a 2-kW DAB converter module switching at 10kHz are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476340","solid state transformer (SST);dual active bridge (DAB);circulating energy;zero voltage switching (ZVS);high efficiency","Frequency conversion;Lead;Reliability;Rectifiers;Pulse width modulation;Switches","commutation;DC-DC power convertors;fault tolerance;high-frequency transformers;inductance;switching convertors;transformer windings;zero voltage switching","dual active bridge converter loss reduction;solid state transformer application;high-frequency transformer isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter module design;module-cascaded SST;phase-shift DAB converter;high-frequency galvanic isolation;bidirectional power flow;zero voltage switching;ZVS;switching device;bidirectional DC-DC converter;power transmission;three-leg bridge;high-frequency transformer winding;winding shunting taps;commutation inductance;primary winding turns;leakage inductance;energy transfer process;time-sharing circuit topology;output current detection;bridge arm structure;flexible control scheme;high-level fault tolerance;power 2 kW;frequency 10 kHz","","1","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further, during the course of writing this report, numerous design changes to the blade to lighten the structure was developed which will help with the required performance of the rotor. By limiting the weight of the components, the blade would have to lift less weight and thus draw less power from the power supply to remain airborne. However, making a craft too light and sacrificing strength is also not advisable as well as there is a possibility of blade failure before the full lift capacity of the blade has been tested. These interplay of factors contribute to making the design of a high efficient long endurance aircraft an especially difficult task. This of course has not factored in the added complexity of balancing energy supply weight and airframe integrity. This balancing act is important as carrying more energy in the form of batteries increases the weight of the aircraft while requiring the blades to generate more lift. This added required lift again requires more energy to overcome the generated corresponding drag. Therefore, finding the most optimal layout and settings is crucial in this particular problem.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476389","","Aircraft;Blades;Lead;Optical fiber testing","aerospace components;aircraft;blades;product design;product development;reliability","failure;airframe integrity;aircraft endurance;design;gears;blades;VTOL aircraft","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However there is a significant lack of understanding of what MaaS actually is on conceptual level. Reviewing the state-of-the-art of MaaS research we deduct that MaaS has all the attributes of a `hyped' socio-technical phenomenon: it seems to be a loosely connected patchwork of optimistic political dogma, activists' enthusiasm, anecdotal evidence of successful services and a firm belief of investors in companies such as Uber. However, as a paradigm shift, MaaS has electrified public decision makers and unleashed a wave of innovation in SMEs. In addition, MaaS forces researchers to work in multi-disciplinary collaborations, transcending `traditional' competence areas, such as traffic planning, computer science, social sciences, transport systems and organisational psychology. Consequently, while embracing the innovative spirit of the MaaS paradigm shift, we aim to outline key conceptual issues of MaaS. These issues are 1) the nature of travel (including purpose, mode, means, distance etc.); 2) MaaS interoperability within intelligent traffic services; 3) the end-user perspective, with a focus on user attitudes and behaviours; and 4) sustainability, including work during the journey, and ultimately not traveling at all (e.g. teleworking). We exemplify our tentative concept through applying it to the existing mobility services Uber, Lyft, Car2Go, DriveNow, Tuup, UbiGo and Moovel.

In harmonic modelling, the regions of the machine cross section are represented as Fourier series and coupled with each other by means of boundary conditions. The field solution is obtained by solving the boundary value problem. In order to quantify the accuracy of the field solutions, global parameters such as cogging torque and flux linkage are computed.

This allows for various manufacture and assembly nuances to be accounted for in the design process, assuring accurate and computationally efficient predictions of the machine thermal behaviour. The post-manufacture calibration of thermal models from tests on a complete machine has limited use in development of machine topologies, where no previous experience or machine hardware exist. In this context, an experiment informed design technique that makes use of reduced order machine sub-assemblies presents an attractive alternative. In particular, the hardware manufacture cost and time is significantly reduced compared to the prototyping of the complete machine assembly. This allows for numerous hardware samples to be constructed and tested, to inform the machine design process. The use of the machine sub-assembly testing is focused, but not limited to identifying and quantifying various power loss and heat transfer phenomena. This paper reviews the applicability of the sub-assembly testing in a broader context of the machine design.

As such, three calculation methods are used in this paper for the calculation of Ctt in case of rectangular conductors: an FEM and two previously published AMs. The influence of wire thickness and wire corner radius on Ctt is investigated. For round cross-section wires, four methods are presented: an FEM and three different AMs. The influence of wire size, insulation thickness and relative dielectric constant of the wire insulation on Ctt are considered. The relative error, i.e. deviation among the methods applied is presented for both types of wires. Finally, the results presented here demonstrate that the method for Ctt calculation should be carefully considered for different cases, since the wrong selected method can result in a deviation of even 400%.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476427","electric machines;formed windings;rectangular wire;round wire;insulation;capacitance;capacitive coupling","Capacitance;Finite element analysis;Wires","electric machines;finite element analysis;insulated wires;insulation;machine windings;permittivity","capacitive coupling;relative error;relative dielectric constant;insulation thickness;wire size;round cross-section wire;rectangular cross-section wire;finite element method;formed windings;turn-to-tum capacitance calculation;analytical models;electrical machines","","1","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulation work packages tackle this problem since they can quickly provide reliable results that permit detection of critical design issues prior to the prototype phase. A trade-off is then often made between model accuracy and computation speed. In the particular case of electric machines, homogenization techniques are used in order to keep high accuracy while running fast calculations. They are involved in multiple disciplines in which the machine performances are verified such as electromagnetic, mechanical, thermal and acoustic domains. This paper aims at defining whether these homogenization methods can be extended from one discipline to another by reviewing them independently of the physical domain.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476431","Homogenization;multidisciplinary;electric machine;modelling","Computational modeling;Mathematical model","cost reduction;electric machines","multidisciplinary homogenization technique;electric machine;cost reduction;simulation work package;acoustic domain;electromagnetic domain;mechanical domain;thermal domain;critical design issue detection","","5","","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For SRMs, a combined MEC-FE model is presented. A table of reluctance as function of flux and rotor position is obtained from a reduced FE model which contains a part of the stator and rotor pole. For SynRMs, two separate MEC models of d and q axes are described. The flux paths in the stator and rotor pole, the stator and rotor yokes are modelled as different flux tubes with different reluctances. The flux-linkage curves of both machines can be obtained with good accuracy and low computation time, taking the full FE models as reference. Furthermore, the capability of the MEC-FE model to assess the influence of different machine parameters is also studied in this paper.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476429","switched reluctance machines;synchronous reluctance machines;magnetic equivalent circuit modelling;finite element analysis","Computational modeling;Rotors;Magnetic resonance imaging;Switches;Stators","magnetic circuits;reluctance machines;rotors;stators","flux-linkage curve;flux tube;stator yoke;rotor pole;rotor yoke;flux path;stator pole;flux position;rotor position;MEC-FE model;SynRM;synchronous reluctance machine;SRM;switched reluctance machine;magnetic equivalent circuit modelling","","5","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first approach is based on a full transient vibro-acoustic analysis of the DSFPM emitted acoustic noise. The second modelling approach is based on a modal superposition analysis of the DSFPM vibro-acoustic behaviour. This multi-physic study is based on a weak coupling between two 3D Finite-Element (FE) models: an electromagnetic model computing the magnetic pressure and a vibroacoustic model to quantify the vibration/noise performances. Results comparison between the two modelling approaches shows the effectiveness of the modal superposition model in terms of precision and computation time.","","978-1-5090-2464-3978-1-5090-2463","10.1109/EVER.2016.7476433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476433","electromagnetic modeling;vibro-acoustic analysis;discoidal switching flux permanent magnet machine (DSFPM);noise radiation;natural frequencies;sound power level (SPL)","Analytical models;Switches;Magnetic analysis;Electromagnetics;Stators;Three-dimensional displays;Iron","finite element analysis;magnetic flux;permanent magnet machines;wind turbines","discoidal switching flux permanent magnet machine;wind turbine application;magneto-vibro-acoustic analysis;three-phase DSFPM;electromagnetic origin;full transient vibro-acoustic analysis;acoustic noise emission;modal superposition analysis;weak coupling;3D finite-element model;3D FE model;electromagnetic model;magnetic pressure computing;vibration-noise performance","","4","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
