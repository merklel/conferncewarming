"Evaluation of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for electric vehicles in Nordic climate conditions","A.

The energy sources and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of electricity generation in the European Nordic countries were presented. The vehicle energy consumption was analyzed based on numerous simulations in different driving cycles and ambient conditions. Daily average energy consumption was calculated based on the temperature data from three different cities in Finland. Vehicle operation CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were calculated based on monthly average energy consumption and average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the electricity generation. The research results clearly show that the energy consumption of electric vehicles is much higher in cold climate conditions. Because the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the electricity generation are high during the winter months in Finland, the vehicle CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are much higher during winter months than in the summer. Due to the relatively low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the electricity generation in most of the Nordic countries, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the vehicle production are more important during vehicle lifecycle.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362390","energy consumption;carbon dioxide;electric vehicle;electricity generation;cold conditions","Energy consumption;Electric vehicles;Meteorology;Production;Batteries;Europe;Urban areas","air pollution control;electric vehicles;energy conservation;energy consumption","electric vehicles;cold climate conditions;electricity generation;vehicle production;vehicle lifecycle;carbon dioxide emissions;Nordic climate conditions;energy sources;European Nordic countries;vehicle energy consumption;energy consumption;CO<sub>2</sub>","","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the main issues to improve the overall range is the minimization of energy consumption. On the one hand an adapted energy management strategy is needed to achieve a more comfortable and acceptable equalization in the range. On the other hand it is important to recuperate mechanical, electrical and thermal energy, both inside and from the vehicles wherever possible. For example, it is thinkable to use the kinetic energy of braking vehicles outside the vehicle to power traffic lights. If a combustion process is used, a lot of waste thermal energy can be reused from the tailpipe. Or solar energy may be used. If a vehicle has a varying duty-cycle it makes sense to adapt the powertrain to suit the power need. Whatever the available energy, it has to go hand in hand with minimizing the energy consumption. This paper is based on the knowledge and combination of future technologies [2], which are useful to collect and convert energy coming from different sources within a vehicle.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362363","energy harvesting;waste heat conversion;thermoelecrtic generator;thermal storage;thermochemical storage;phase change material;shock absorber;magnetocaloric refrigeration","Waste heat;Turbines;Thermal energy;Generators;Resistance heating;Heat recovery;Phase change materials","braking;combustion;electric vehicles;energy consumption;energy harvesting;energy management systems;solar power","mechanical energy conversion;electrical energy conversion;thermal energy conversion;energy consumption;kinetic energy;waste thermal energy;solar energy;braking;future electric driven vehicle;combustion motor driven vehicles;ecological vehicle energy harvesting;energy demand requirements;energy management strategy;drive train efficiency","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of their drawback is the high demagnetizing current required in the flux weakening region to let the motor achieve high speeds. This problem can be mitigated by equipping the motor with a mechanical devices consisting of mobile rotor yokes. These move radially by centrifugal force so as to reduce the air-gap flux at high speed with no need for demagnetizing current injection. This paper addresses the problem of modeling such IPM motor to study its steady-state behavior under different operating conditions, both in the full-flux and in the flux-weakening region of the speed range. The approach uses a limited set of non-linear finite element analysis to characterize the dependency of motor flux linkages on the stator currents and rotor position. Interpolating functions are then obtained to mathematically capture this dependency and plug it into the steady-state electromechanical equations of the motor. The effectiveness and accuracy of the method are assessed through on-load measurements taken on the modelled motor both in low and high speed operation.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362393","Permanent magnet machines;finite element analysis;steady state analytical model","Mathematical model;Couplings;Permanent magnet motors;Interpolation;Steady-state;Traction motors;Rotors","finite element analysis;magnetic flux;permanent magnet motors;rotors;stators","FEA-assisted steady-state modelling;spoke type IPM machine;enhanced flux weakening capability;interior permanent magnet machines;spoke-type design;vehicle traction;high demagnetizing current;mechanical devices;mobile rotor yokes;centrifugal force;air-gap flux;IPM motor;steady-state behavior;flux-weakening region;nonlinear finite element analysis;motor flux linkages;stator currents;rotor position;steady-state electromechanical equations;on-load measurements","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, optimized energy management strategies (EMS), before being integrated in a real system, need to be validated in a scaled test-bench platform in order to identify the possible deviations from the expected simulation-based profiles, thus, saving time during the implementation in the real application. An economical and flexible way of validating these strategies is the Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. In this framework, this work aims to compare the experimental results of two optimized (simulation-based) EMSs applied on a hybrid electric urban bus (HEB) in terms of real-time operational performance. Both EMSs handle the proper power split behavior of the vehicle demand between a genset (internal combustion engine connected to an electric generator) and a hybrid energy storage system (combining Li-ion batteries with supercapacitors). The hardware in the test-bench consist of a scaled electrical DC grid of an HEB.

The water storage reservoir is indispensable to ensure the reliability and to improve the system's overall efficiency. The aim of this study is to find the lowest operating cost of generation sources by taking into account the startup/shutdown cost, the maintenance cost, and the fuel cost. As wind and water are the sources of free energy, the maximum use of available energy from WT and hydro turbine (HT) is necessary. The DU is decided to be ON/OFF based on binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) to minimize the fuel consumption and to improve the energy reliability. In order to compare the cost-effectiveness, the simulation stage has been conducted for three scenarios of DU operation during 24h. In the first scenario, the DU is continuously operated at its maximum efficiency point, without using an optimization technique, if the power produced by a WT and HT is unmet the load demand. The second scenario deals with employing the DU with its optimal power determined by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The third scenario demonstrates how the DU is controlled to be ON/OFF using BPSO, by considering technical and economic constraints. The simulation results clearly indicate the appropriateness of the proposed method for achieving the best operation of the DU.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362400","Binary PSO;operating cost;ON/OFF operation;diesel unit","Optimization;Wind turbines;Economics;Reservoirs;Fuels","distributed power generation;particle swarm optimisation;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;pumped-storage power stations;reservoirs;wind turbines","hybrid energy system;pump-hydro turbine;water storage reservoir;fuel cost;binary particle swarm optimization;fuel consumption;energy reliability;DU operation;optimal economic operation strategy;wind turbine-diesel unit;pumped hydro energy storage;optimal power sharing","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In an effort to help to improve the returns of farming in an environmentally acceptable way, the project's objective is to investigate the feasibility of a small size electric farming tractor, which shall be able to use locally generated renewable energy. The crucial technical challenge is (as with other electric vehicles) to store sufficient electrical energy on the tractor for an extension of its operating time. On the other hand, economic competitiveness with comparable combustion engine tractors is a prerequisite for the project's success. Consequently, the project investigates an electric tractor system using alternative technical solutions in order to extend the operating time to a maximum and to compare the tractor's tractive power and its hourly operating cost to a combustion engine tractor of a similar power rating.

For example, the Lundell car alternator has a low efficiency, partly due to a high-current diode voltage drop of 1.1V, being 2.2V in a bridge configuration, resulting in 15% of output voltage and corresponding losses. Schottky diodes have a lower drop, but are quite fragile and seem not to be preferred in that application. This paper proposes a two terminal circuit with a MOSFET, which emulates a diode while having a very low voltage drop. The main item is that the MOSFET is turned on at a small negative drain-source voltage. This could be done using an op-amp circuit, but the used transistor array circuit can have a lower current consumption. At full load, some 73% voltage drop reduction is possible, for example while using a MOSFET of max. 0.003 ohm on-resistance at 125°C, hence the voltage drop at 100 A can be limited to 0.3 V. At a rather typical 30A DC-current load, some 87% voltage drop reduction is possible, 100mV drop compared to 0.8V for a diode. The solution costs hardly more than the usual “press-fit” diodes. The circuit has a short paid back time, by the lower use of aluminum for the heat sink and the fuel saving. In large quantity such MOSFET can cost less than 0.5 Euro, and the cost of the circuit is not larger.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362385","Ideal diode;energy saving;automotive;Lundell alternator;energy saving","","alternators;automotive electronics;electric potential;low-power electronics;MOSFET circuits;operational amplifiers;rectifying circuits;Schottky diodes;semiconductor device models","ideal diode circuits;Lundell alternator rectifiers;low voltage power applications;diode voltage drops;Lundell car alternator;high-current diode voltage drop;schottky diodes;terminal circuit;MOSFET;low voltage drop;negative drain-source voltage;op-amp circuit;transistor array circuit;DC-current load;current consumption;voltage drop reduction;press-fit diodes;heat sink;temperature 125.0 degC;voltage 1.1 V;voltage 2.2 V;resistance 0.003 ohm;current 100.0 A","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The optimization objectives of the proposed CMOP are the fuel cost, depreciation expense and emission cost of distributed generators. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is introduced for conversion from the multi-objective problem to a single-objective one.

In this work, an analysis was performed for implementation of small modular district heating/cooling system in Visoko, covering several public buildings and few neighborhoods in north-western part of town. Combination of different renewable energy sources were analyzed leading to an optimal and a very promising energy supply strategy due to its contribution to security of supply, financial stability, local economic development, local employment, etc. Possible financial savings for heating of 38% compared to current financial needs are determined. Structure optimization of solar collector holders was also performed, taking into account external influence, enabling savings in the structure material. These activities have numerous benefits, contributing to considerable annual GHG emission reduction, total annual costs savings, therefore reducing the rate of expenditures of public money, better living quality, creation of “green jobs”, increased awareness and understanding for energy efficiency and its resulting benefits.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362329","modular district heating grids;renewable energy sources;heat storage;heat pumps;solar collectors;structural optimization;cost-effectiveness","Solar heating;Heat pumps;Optimization;Buildings;Production;Cooling","air pollution;cooling;district heating;energy conservation;optimisation;renewable energy sources;solar absorber-convertors;space heating;structural engineering;sustainable development","modular district heating system;neighborhoods;visoko;mechanical structure optimization;solar collector holders;coolheating project;solar collectors;biomass systems;geothermal pumps;modular renewable heating grids;South-Eastern Europe;financial stability;local economic development;structure material;public buildings;heat sources;renewable energy sources;energy supply strategy;modular cooling system;modular district heating;GHG emission reduction","","","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This puts Belgium in the list of 10 countries that passed the 1% electric vehicle market penetration threshold in 2016 (Bloomberg New Energy Agency, 2017). With a financial incentive already in place for private car buyers in the region Flanders, more incentives are under study to accelerate the transition to an electrified fleet. Obviously, the policy makers aim to implement incentives which perform well on effectiveness and efficiency. We have first conducted an extensive secondary sources review on e-mobility incentives and next carried out an expert survey on a selection of the non-financial incentives. The following incentives are evaluated by the experts: roll-out of charging infrastructure, pilot and demonstration projects, parking incentives, communication campaigns, incentives for the usage of public charging infrastructure, incentives for charging at the work place, EV car sharing incentives and HOV lane usage for EVs. We report on best practices for these incentives in terms of the implementation and the timing, the pitfalls and benefits, and the advised accompanying incentives. In general, our results show that experts evaluate roll-out and usage incentives for charging infrastructure and parking incentives highly in terms of both cost effectiveness and cost-benefit ratio. Communication campaigns score well in terms of cost effectiveness, but poorly on cost-benefit ratio; whereas the opposite is true for charging at the work place. The best practices and insight on impact of these easy mobility incentives will be used by policy makers to further develop the strategy for an accelarated uptake of cleaner vehicles.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362401","electromobility;incentives;survey;policy","Automobiles;Charging stations;Best practices;Companies;Urban areas;Batteries;Electronic mail","automobiles;battery powered vehicles;electric vehicle charging;hybrid electric vehicles","easy mobility incentives;newly registered Belgian vehicles;battery electric vehicles;e-mobility incentives;nonfinancial incentives;EV car sharing incentives;parking incentives;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;PHEV;BEV;Belgium;electric vehicle market penetration;Bloomberg New Energy Agency;Flanders region;nonfinancial incentive;public charging infrastructure","","","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MTDC grid has lower capital costs and lower losses than an equivalent AC transmission system. Thus for long distance power transmission, MTDC grid becomes a very attractive solution. Since the MTDC network is now built based on VSCs, it automatically offers better quality of transmitted power along with more flexibility in power transmission over the conventional current source converters. However, VSC based MTDC transmission systems are vulnerable to DC side fault and often expensive DC circuit breakers are required to protect them against DC fault. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of DC Circuit Breaker (DCCB) performance on the rating, control and operation of modular multi-level converters (MMC) inside a MTDC system. Furthermore, it is established that depending on the type of DCCBs the converter component ratings can be reduced which contributes to the overall reduction in system cost. Performance analysis has been done to investigate the fault current limiting capabilities of each of the types of DCCBs.

The battery pack is currently the major cost driver for these vehicles. Thus, battery durability is an important lever to economically establish electric mobility in the mass market. A segmentation modelling approach, based on unsupervised clustering algorithms, evaluates battery management system field data from BMW i3 vehicles such as state of charge, temperature and current in terms of their historical distribution. Clustering algorithms, due to their frequent use in the field of machine learning and information retrieval, are able to analyse big quantities of vehicle data with the aim to group vehicles with similar driving behaviour. The cluster analysis is further validated using the method of calculating respective silhouette coefficients to assess clustering performance and the influence of input parameters. The analysis of histograms concludes with the definition of the most common types of drivers worldwide. The vehicle clusters can further be correlated with battery ageing in order to find suitable 2nd life applications as part of stationary energy storage systems.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362381","automotive battery;lithium-ion batteries;electrical energy storage;unsupervised segmentation model;clustering;silhouette coefficient","Batteries;Histograms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;State of charge;Temperature distribution;Temperature sensors","battery management systems;battery powered vehicles;data mining;driver information systems;energy storage;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;road vehicles;secondary cells","electric vehicles;unsupervised segmentation models;data mining methods;battery pack;battery durability;electric mobility;segmentation modelling approach;unsupervised clustering algorithms;battery management system field data;cluster analysis;clustering performance;vehicle clusters;battery ageing;driving behaviour;driving load analysis;battery time replacement;driving mileage assessment","","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wave energy has been underrated all the past years. Wave energy has more potential and more advantage the other forms of renewable energy. More predictable, consistent and controllable than either wind or solar power, with the right infrastructure in place, it could be a sustainable alternative for supplying base-load power. It also has a very low impact that neither disturbs aquatic life nor spoils the coastal view that prompts so much ire from the public. The paper presents a wave power converter system. The results obtained are analyzed and the data of the simulation are presented as preliminary validation. The purpose it is to discuss different wave energy converter WEC, we will have a full simulation of each type and discuss the functioning of each one of them. The models are implemented and simulated through the applications Design Modeler, ANSYS AQWA and WEC-SIM. On the basis of the simulated results, we can conclude that generating power from the wave is quite promising for our future and will be a great addition in the renewable energy market, and will contribute to face the global climate change problem.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362405","Wave Energy Converter WEC;Point Absorber PTO;wave energy;buoy;ocean current power;sustainability","Computational modeling;Renewable energy sources;Prototypes;Biological system modeling;Finite element analysis;Oceans;Data models","power markets;power system simulation;wave power plants","applications Design Modeler;renewable energy market;global climate change problem;wave energy converter system;Point absorber;base-load power;wave power converter system;ANSYS AQWA;WEC-SIM","","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different from other 60-Degree Bus-Clamping based DTC (60<sup>°</sup>BC-DTC) strategies, the approach adopted in the selection of the clamped phase of the proposed strategy depends on the revolving reference stator current vector I<sub>s</sub>instead of the stator flux vector Φ<sub>s</sub>. A comparison study between the classical DTC strategy and the proposed BC-DTC one is achieved. Simulation results have proven that the proposed BC-DTC strategy exhibits better performance during both transient and steady-state operations than the first one. Therefore, a reduction of the electromagnetic torque ripple amplitudes is gained. Extending the comparison to the converter operation, and through various comparison criteria, we have found that the considered 60<sup>°</sup>BC-DTC strategy offers the lowest average commutation frequency and the lowest average switching losses and the highest quality factor.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362376","60° BC-DTC strategy;induction motor;two-level three-phase inverter;revolving reference stator current vector;comparison study;comparison criteria","Stators;Induction motors;Torque;Inverters;Voltage control;Switches;Electromagnetics","induction motor drives;invertors;stators;torque","BC-DTC strategy;clamped phase;BC-DTC one;advanced bus-clamping DTC strategy","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As optimization parameters torque ripple reduction techniques as skewing, cosine formed tooth and width of tooth are chosen. The combined multi-parameter optimization is necessary because of interactions between the optimization parameter effects. An analysis for a machine of 25 kW, used in urban electric vehicles, is done with different excitations to build up the working points. The results show a large effect of increasing skewing to decrease torque and increase ripples independent of excitation. The effects of the other techniques are smaller.

Given the same take-off torque capability, three motors are compared that have the same stator geometry but different magnet materials in the rotor; two PMSMs - one with Nd(Dy)FeB and one with SmCo magnets - and one PMaSynRM with strontium-ferrite magnets. To compensate the weaker magnets, their corresponding core stacks are prolonged. The resulting torque capability at high speed levels is lower for the SmCo PMSM and ferrite PMaSynRM compared to the Nd(Dy)FeB PMSM. The ferrite PMaSynRM has the poorest dynamic vehicle performance, but also the lowest energy losses over a wide range of drive cycles. In addition, the ferrite based motor option has the lowest environmental impact during manufacturing as well as the lowest material cost estimate. The SmCo motor has slightly lower losses than the Nd(Dy)FeB, but the highest material cost.

The solution of this task is based on the remaining useful life evaluation technique and on the multi-state system reliability Markov model for the systems with degradation states, which can be practically applied to any type of electric vehicles.

However, the nowadays repurposing process from vehicle batteries to Second-Life storage systems is characterized by time and cost intensive process steps like disassembly to module level and manual state of health (SOH) measurements with costly test equipment. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to introduce a novel cloud-connected battery management approach to estimate the residual value of vehicle batteries in respect to various potential Second-Life applications. Based on measurement data acquired by the battery management system (BMS) during regular vehicle operation, the state of the vehicle battery is continuously updated in the form of an electric-thermal system model on a server backend. In combination with an empirical aging model, the degradation behaviour for different Second-Life scenarios' load cycles can be predicted and thus the residual value calculated.

In order to obtain the maximum fuel economy potential, backward simulators are developed based on dynamic programming by considering the transmission efficiency, power electronics system and hydraulic system loss. From the simulation results, it is found that as the number of gear step increases, the engine operation is performed more closely on the optimal operating line for the minimum fuel consumption. Accordingly, the amount of motor load leveling power decreases and the power electronics system loss is reduced. On the other hand, the hydraulic system loss becomes larger with the increased number of gear step due to the additional elements, which cause lubrication and sealing losses. For CVT HEV, even if the engine thermal efficiency is improved and PE loss can be reduced by CVT function, the fuel economy is rather reduced because of the high hydraulic system loss required to maintain the 3~4 times higher line pressure than AT.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362368","hybrid electric vehicle(HEV);gear step;transmission mounted electric device(TMED);fuel economy potential","Engines;Gears;Hybrid electric vehicles;Batteries;Torque;Fuels;Optimization","dynamic programming;engines;hybrid electric vehicles;hydraulic systems;power transmission (mechanical);variable speed gear","lubrication;continuously variable transmission;gears;parallel hybrid electric vehicle;automatic transmission;dynamic programming","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Claw pole automotive alternators can provide low cost alternative to permanent magnet generators for small wind turbine application. The analysis was performed using FEMM-2D simulation software, which is based on finite element method. Similarly a control system of a wind turbine has been proposed. Small wind power systems are very attractive to support the energy demand for rural areas or developing countries where the electrical microgrid infrastructure is limited.

The proposed optimization procedure is initially-applied to an elementary concept. The force of the optimized concept is validated by a 2D finite element analysis (FEA). Then, the optimization procedure is extended to the entire machine. In spite of the force enhancement, it has been found that the machine is penalized by asymmetrical phase flux linkages. An approach to counter this limitation, through the reduction of the end effect, is proposed and validated by 2D FEA.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362334","IPM tubular linear synchronous machines;electromagnetic force;optimization procedure;slot per pole and per phase;finite element analysis;end effect reduction","Optimization;Force;Electromagnetic forces;Couplings;Stator windings;Analytical models","electromagnetic forces;finite element analysis;linear machines;machine windings;permanent magnet machines;synchronous machines;wave power generation","industrial applications;optimization procedure;interior PM tubular linear synchronous machines;electromagnetic force production capability;2D finite element analysis;energy conversion systems;linear permanent magnet synchronous machines;IPM-TLSM;analytical model-based optimization;wave energy conversion systems;fractional-slot-arranged winding;asymmetrical phase flux linkages","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In conventional direct drive traction systems, every motor needs its own inverter, which has to be dimensioned to at least the motor's full power. Because of the natural operating characteristics of the BDFM, in the new proposed system the motors can be supplied mainly from a large, shared inverter, whereas the wheel's speed differences and torque regulation can be controlled from small, auxiliary inverters for each motor. On the one hand, this can lead to cost savings on system level, and on the other hand the BDFM offers advantages like simple materials and production as well as increased functional safety because of the lack of magnets and brushes. As the power density of the BDFM is smaller in comparison to conventional machines, this concept may be mainly interesting for heavy-duty vehicles, where the motor's weight is less important.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362360","brushless doubly-fed machine;BDFM;direct drive;traction drive;cost-effectiveness","Wheels;Inverters;Windings;Stator windings;Induction motors;Rotors;Permanent magnet motors","asynchronous machines;brushless machines;permanent magnet motors;rotors;torque control;traction motor drives;traction power supplies","heavy-duty traction applications;induction machine;BDFM;direct drive system;shared inverter;auxiliary inverters;heavy-duty vehicles","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, based on the magnetic gearing effect and finite element analysis, the electromagnetic performances of VFRMs with both winding types are compared.

The influence of DC bias on the JA model is analyzed. The parameters in the JA model are extracted from BH loops without DC bias but they are applicable for the one under DC bias condition. Thus the modified JA model is practically convenient for iron loss prediction. Moreover, the parameter identification is fast. In addition, the influence of different magnetic induction levels and frequency is incorporated in the model. An accurate measurement system is established to measure the BH loops and iron loss. The tested results are demonstrated and compared with the predicted iron loss to verify the modified JA model.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362391","Jiles-Atherton Model;iron loss;DC bias","Mathematical model;Iron;Magnetic hysteresis;Magnetization;Magnetic domain walls;Magnetic domains;Saturation magnetization","electromagnetic induction;magnetic hysteresis;steel","DC bias condition;modified JA model;iron loss prediction;BH loops;iron loss;modified Jiles-Atherton model;magnetic induction levels;accurate measurement system","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The BMS consists of a central control unit and decentralized cell modules. Because auf its topology, it can be scaled flexible to a varying number of battery cells. It measures voltages, currents and temperatures, to avoid critical and lifetime shortening operating conditions. States like state of charge (SoC) and power capability are estimated, calculated and predicted therefor. The full capacity of each cell in the pack is used, by means of active or passive load balancing. The BMS functions are developed by using a low-cost RCP system, which consists of an open source simulation tool and a low cost hardware platform. The development of a nonlinear SoC estimator and an active balancing function will be used as an example for the model-based design process.","","978-1-5386-5966-3978-1-5386-5965-6978-1-5386-5967","10.1109/EVER.2018.8362402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362402","scalable battery management system;lithium-ion battery;low-cost development platform;Rapid Control Prototyping;model-based design","Batteries;Mathematical model;Hardware;Real-time systems;Software;Battery charge measurement;Load modeling","battery management systems;secondary cells","cell modules;battery cells;lifetime shortening operating conditions;low cost hardware platform;active balancing function;low-cost Rapid Control Prototyping System;flexible scalable battery management system;software functions;lithium-ion batteries","","1","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper uses the finite control model prediction control algorithm to control stacked Neutral-Point Clamped forming a thirteen-level Cascaded H-Bridge multicellular converter symmetric. The highly dynamic performance of multicell converters controlled by the Model Predictive Control are used to predict the current that feeds a three-phase line by inverter who are using of low-voltage components such as 1400-V IGBTs that are mass produced with a cost advantage over high-voltage (>1700 V) IGBTs.
