Light and heavy duty commercial vehicles account for up to 40 percent of the overall traffic volume and therefore are an interesting area to implement alternative propulsion systems. Contrary to passenger cars, the auxiliary units of urban commercial vehicles can account for a major amount of the energy consumption. Drive train topologies incorporating these auxiliaries can be very complex, especially if the main drive and the auxiliary drive are interlinked. To support researchers and developers selecting suitable concepts for further evaluation and for them to comprehend the available design space, this paper provides a structured methodology introducing a morphological analysis for commercial vehicles with energy intensive auxiliaries. Furthermore, a structured approach is offered in order to reduce the design space utilizing energy consumption simulation, requirement analysis and expert interviews. In a case study the methodology is applied to large street sweeping vehicles in metropolitan areas.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7113011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113011","commercial vehicle;electrified drive trains;morphological analysis;technology selection methodology","Vehicles;Topology;Batteries;Energy consumption;Fuel storage;Fuel cells","automobiles;electric drives;electric propulsion;electric vehicles;energy consumption;road traffic","vehicle drive train technology;topology pre-selection;road transportation;propulsion system;passenger car;morphological analysis;energy intensive auxiliary;energy consumption simulation;metropolitan area","","1","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, it has been established that the efficiency of the PV cells is penalized by heat. In order to eradicate this drawback and to enhance the energy efficiency, the PV conversion could be allied to a thermal (T) one, leading to PV/T hybrid systems. The paper is aimed at an experimental investigation of the electrical and thermal performance of a hybrid PV/T concept which is based on a PV panel associated to a heat exchanger. Thanks to a forced circulation of water, the main roles of the exchanger are (i) the reduction of the temperature of the PV panel and (ii) the water heating for domestic use. The experimental study includes a comparison between the performance of the proposed PV/T hybrid system and those of separate PV and water heater panels.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7112928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112928","PV system;heat exchanger;PV/thermal hybrid system;experimental investigation;comparative study","Temperature measurement;Photovoltaic systems;Glass;Water heating;Fluids;Resistance heating","energy conservation;heat exchangers;solar cells;sunlight;thermal analysis;water","photovoltaic cell;water heating;temperature reduction;water circulation;heat exchangers;PV conversion;energy efficiency enhancement;PV cell panel efficiency;electricity;sun photo-energy;PV-T hybrid system;thermal performance;electrical performance","","1","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover volt-ampere power of the generation system rises 25%. If power converter is equipped in energy storage then it may deliver active and reactive power what, in transient states keeps stability of generated voltage and frequency.

Then, four other IPMSM models, which are obtained by modifying the IPMSM1 rotor structure and by maintaining the same stator configuration, are proposed and analyzed. From the obtained simulation results, the cogging torque components for each structure are determined and compared. From this comparison, a significant cogging torque decrease is occurring for the modified geometries, without affecting the values of the generated torque. Furthermore, a meaningful relationship between the peak values of the cogging torque and the gradients of the flux density around the neutral area is reported and discussed.

The machine used to convert mechanical power into electric power is a hybrid excitation synchronous generator (HESG). In this machine, the excitation flux is created by both permanent magnets and excitation coils, so the output voltage can be controlled by the DC excitation field. For isolated loads, it is then possible to use very reliable wind generator architecture, composed only by a HESG, a rectifier and a DC/DC converter to control the excitation flux. However, HESM are non-linear machines so, regarding their control, conventional controllers are not always sufficient to ensure a good stability and high performance. An H<sub>∞</sub>controller is then used and designed assuming first harmonic hypothesis in order to control the wind generator in all the regions of the shaft output power versus wind speed curve. The effect of harmonics on the system robustness is then analyzed.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7112941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112941","hybrid excitation synchronous machine;wind energy;robust control","Robustness;Coils;Biological system modeling;Adaptation models;US Department of Transportation","DC-DC power convertors;H∞control;machine control;rectifiers;robust control;synchronous generators;voltage control;wind power plants","DC/DC converter;hybrid excitation synchronous generator robust control;wind applications;rectifier;isolated load;HESG;excitation flux;permanent magnets;excitation coils;output voltage control;DC excitation field;wind generator architecture;H∞ controller;wind generator;wind speed curve","","3","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this way the mass of the vehicle is reduced and therefore the energy consumed per unit distance is improved. For higher ranges the BEV is powered by both battery packs. This concept allows the introduction of subscription-based ownership models to distribute the cost of the large battery pack over the vehicle lifetime. A methodology is proposed for the analysis and evaluation of the proposed concept in comparison with a direct owned non swappable single pack BEV, proving that significant improvements on city fuel economy (up to 20 %) and economic benefits are achievable under several scenarios.

This paper proposes novel high torque density magnetically-geared switched flux permanent magnet machines in which the stator is partitioned into two stators but with armature windings and PM excitations separately on each stator whilst the number of rotor segmented iron pieces is approximately twice or equal to the number of the stator teeth / poles. Therefore, the developed machines are double stator / single rotor machines. The armature outer stator is equipped with concentrated non-overlapping winding and identical to the stator of a fractional-slot PM machine, whilst the structure of the inner excitation stator has interior PMs with flux focusing, but structurally identical to the rotor of a conventional interior PM machine. The influence of design parameters is investigated at a fixed copper loss by a 2-dimensional finite element analysis method. Furthermore, the effect of different rotor and stator pole combinations is also analysed in detail. The electromagnetic performance of the proposed machines show that the odd rotor pole number machines are potentially better in terms of high torque and low torque ripple compared to the equivalent even rotor pole number machines under the same condition, albeit with potential unbalanced magnetic force which may be eliminated by doubling the stator and rotor pole numbers. Finally, the predicted electromagnetic performances of the proposed machines are validated by experiments on the fabricated prototype.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7112948","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112948","C-core;flux switching;magnetically-geared;machine;permanent magnet;switched flux;torque density","Magnetic analysis;Switches;Torque;Prototypes","finite element analysis;magnetic forces;permanent magnet machines;rotors;stators;torque","high torque density;magnetically-geared switched flux permanent magnet machine;rare-earth magnet;stator teeth;armature winding;PM excitation;rotor pole;fractional-slot PM machine;flux focusing;copper loss;2-dimensional finite element analysis method;electromagnetic performance;torque ripple;potential unbalanced magnetic force","","4","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Energy Harvesting (EH) offers an alternative to batteries replacement or, at least it allows the increase of their lifetime. EH is the conversion of ambient energy, which is present in the environment, into electrical energy. Different energy sources for EH applications have been reported in the literature: light, radio frequency (RF), temperature gradients, solar energy, vibrations. In this paper we will focus on vibration EH. In a Vibration Energy Harvester (VEH) electrical energy is generated by allowing an inertial mass to vibrate with respect to a frame. In this paper a closed-form analysis of the model of a single-degree of freedom Out-of-Plane Switchless Electrostatic Vibration Energy Harvester (SEVEH) will be presented and discussed. We will demonstrate that, under suitable reasonable assumptions, it is possible to study SEVEHs by using models that admit closed form solutions and, at the same time, are enough accurate if the simplifying hypothesis are met. In particular, a circuital model will be developed which describes both the mechanical and the electrical subsystems composing a SEVEH.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7112921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112921","Electrostatic vibration energy harvester;closed form analysis;circuital model","Electrostatics;Vibrations;Generators;Capacitors;Switches;Integrated circuit modeling;Wireless sensor networks","electrostatic devices;energy harvesting;reliability;vibrations","closed-form analysis;electrical energy;energy sources;inertial mass;single-degree of freedom out-of-plane switchless electrostatic vibration energy harvester;SEVEH;electrical subsystems;mechanical subsystems;reliability","","6","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The inherent challenges of IWM vehicles are powertrain packaging, increased unsprung mass, and motor cooling. Elimination of hub-reduction gearbox and adaption of high torque and low power electric motor can mitigate these challenges, but it degrades high speed gradeability. Simultaneous optimization of motor power, battery size and drivability parameters to size the powertrain components (electric motor and gearbox) is important for the effective design of powertrain layout. In this study, motor torque, base speed, and gear-ratio are taken as design variables to minimize the motor peak power and the battery size, while maximizing the drivability performance. AC induction machines and Li-ion batteries are considered for the discussion, but the same approach can be applied for other motor and battery types. The results are validated virtually using a high-fidelity vehicle simulator, which confirms the findings of MOO.

This paper concerns a high speed traction machine radial-field design that closely considers the endurance duty-cycle and/or driving cycle of a race car and provides fast acceleration. The proposed electrical machine is designed to be ultra-light-weight. Therefore, an 18,000 rpm (single gear), 24 slot, 4 pole and 33 Nm brushless highly saturated permanent magnet machine is designed, with an active mass of around 3.0 kg (~ 10kW/kg and 10 Nm/kg). To account for the various race events, the velocity of the racing tracks is to be closely matched with the machine output characteristics. Within this paper, the design and no-load results will be presented. In the near future (Q2 of 2015), following extended tests, this machine (integrated with a specifically designed single-stage gear) will be used to drive the vehicle using torque vectoring on all four-wheels.

This technology is capable of enhancing the efficiency in production and consumption of electricity and improves the reliability and integration of renewable power into the grid. Current grids focus on centralized supply sources. However; the grid's design can be modified and thus enhanced to receive fixed and predictable loads and to accept power from the renewable and distributed energy resources all through the grid. On the other hand, knowing that these resources are discontinuous and non-monotonic in nature, the grid requires an integration of monitoring and control technologies, as well as integration with automation processes in the aim of controlling divergent energy flows and planning for standby capacity to absorb the intermittent generation. The solar photovoltaic (PV) system consists of many stages with the conversion stage as one of the most crucial stage in the whole system. Accordingly, the characteristics and features of this stage control the behaviour of the solar PV system. Therefore; it is recommended that intelligent interfaces be linked and connected to the PV system to empower the grid the ability to handle two-way flows of power and communication. This implementation is required and will permit the seamless integration of solar technologies in high-penetration developments. In this paper, the authors aimed at reviewing the smart grid characteristics in the light of integrating renewable energy.

Therefore, two control schemes based on a current controller and an MPPT algorithm are handled in only one processing stage. The MPPT algorithm computes in real-time the dc voltage that should be applied across the PV generator so as to extract the maximum power. The output of the MPPT algorithm is thereafter considered as a reference of a current controller that should perform a perfect tracking of the dc-voltage reference and also near unity input power factor operation. The proposed photovoltaic power conversion topology and control method are tested by numerical simulations.

Synchronous reluctance machine (SynRM) can be a competitive technology when compared to other machines, e.g. induction machines, since the lack of rotor winding limit the copper losses. In SynRM torque is produced due to anisotropy of the rotor that is achieved by introducing flux barriers in the rotor. These flux barriers have an influence on Noise Vibration and Harshness (NVH) behavior of the machine, since they are responsible for variation of magnetic resistance [1]. Torque ripple which is also higher in synchronous machines than in other types of machine causes extra vibrations and noise [2]. In this paper, the influence of flux barriers configuration on the overall NVH behavior of the machine is studied. A multi-physics numerical study also permits to do a review on NVH issues origins in SynRM.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7112973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112973","Synchronous Reluctance Machine;rotor geometry;flux barriers;multi-physics model;NVH","Rotors;Radio frequency;Noise","electric vehicles;noise;reluctance machines;rotors;vibrations","rotor geometry;NVH behavior;synchronous reluctance machine;permanent magnet synchronous machines;electric vehicles;induction machines;rotor winding;copper losses;SynRM torque;noise vibration and harshness behavior;magnetic resistance;torque ripple;flux barrier configuration;multiphysics numerical study","","7","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The output powers of photovoltaic PV system are crucially depending of the two variable factors, which are the cell temperatures and solar irradiances. Since the maximum power point (MPP) varies, based these variables, appropriate algorithms must be utilized to track the MPP and maintain the operation of the system in it. These algorithms, known as Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), are essential in a PV system. This paper presents evaluations among the most usual MPPT control strategies, doing meaningful studies on merits, demerits and classification of each method. The algorithms, were digitally implemented on the dSPACE DS1104 platform, are Constant voltage (CV), short circuit current (SCC), perturb and observe (P&amp;O) and incremental conductance (IC). The PV system operate at MPPT is used to supply three phase induction motor driving a centrifugal pump. DC/DC boost converter and three phase inverter are connected into between PV generator and motor for power conditioning. The experimental results verify that the proposed MPPT algorithms are able to find real global MPP correctly and quickly. Advantages, disadvantages, and characteristics of different MPPT techniques are studied, evaluated, and compared through extensive computational experiments.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7112975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112975","Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT);Photovoltaic;Water pumping system;Performance evaluation;dSPACE implementation","Temperature;Maximum power point trackers;Pumps;Mathematical model;Short-circuit currents;Induction motors;Inverters","induction motors;invertors;maximum power point trackers;power generation control;pumps;solar power","experimental studies;performance evaluation;MPPT control strategies;solar-powered water pumps;photovoltaic system;renewable energies;cell temperatures;solar irradiances;maximum power point tracking;dSPACE DS1104 platform;constant voltage;short circuit current;perturb and observe;incremental conductance;three phase induction motor;centrifugal pump;DC/DC boost converter;three phase inverter;PV generator;power conditioning","","1","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Time is a limiting factor which prevents the effective use of biological treatment method, since the biodegradation of oil products is highly dependent on the season of a year and takes place only during the warm period, when the microorganisms act as active decomposers. Biodegradation of oil and its products takes about 9 months in a temperate climate zone. By properly organizing the modern biological systems of treatment of soil polluted by oil products, considerably better result can be achieved compared to previously used methods. Soil heating is one of ways to increase the intensity of biodegradation process of oil products. For this purpose the solar energy, one of the alternative energy sources, was used. Changes of diesel fuel and heavy fuel oil concentrations in soil during cold and warm season were studied. In order to determine the heat transfer process in soil, the modeling of the part of defined solar system had been done. The modeling realized using FEM (Finite Element Method) computer software constituted on numerical solution of heat equation. Simulation results indicate the dependency of contaminated soil temperature from the outer air temperature as well as comparing the physical experiments with the modeling results. To summarize the results we can state, that the outcome of biological treatment of samples using solar-based heating system during cold and warm seasons was better in both cases of pollutants. Heat produced by solar collector intensified the process of degradation of pollutants: in samples with solar-based water heating system, the diesel fuel removal level reached 70 %, in case of heavy fuel oil - 46 %, and in control samples it was 54 % for diesel fuel and 26% for heavy fuel oil. The treatment time of soil contaminated with oil products decreased accordingly. The obtained results allow to propose new technological principles of remediation of polluted soil, which decrease the treatment time, and thus the cost, and extends the area of application of alternative energy sources.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7112934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112934","biodegradation;solar collector;oil products","Soil;Water heating;Solar heating;Heat transfer;Mathematical model;Biodegradation","biotechnology;environmental degradation;microorganisms;oil pollution;soil pollution;solar heating","solar water heating system;oil contaminated soil treatment;bioremediation;biotechnology;oil products;biological treatment method;microorganisms;active decomposers;temperate climate zone;soil pollution treatment;biodegradation process;solar energy;energy sources;heavy fuel oil concentrations;heat transfer process;solar system;finite element method;FEM computer software;heat equation;numerical solution;contaminated soil temperature dependency;outer air temperature;solar collector;diesel fuel removal level","","","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the decrease of photovoltaic cells price, photovoltaic motors could be more affordable and reliable than conventional systems, and therefore particularly well suited for off-grid applications. The concept has been patented under various forms, but the scientific literature is so far very scarce. In this article, we attempt to classify photovoltaic motors, and to explain in details their physical working principle.

The proposed approach is based on estimating the current ESR, of each storage system element with a fast control of the balancing circuit present at the terminal of each storage element. The fast control is applied for a short moment and could be applied at any storage system state with no incidence on the system. The information about this current parameter makes the state of health monitoring possible.

The optimal power management of the propulsion system can lead to a substantial improvement of ship efficiency ensuring both compliance with environmental constraints and lower energy consumption. In this paper, an optimal control strategy is proposed on a new naval propulsion system architecture based on the Double Fed Induction Machine (DFIM). The method is based on the power consumed by the propulsion system; several control techniques are evaluated in order to define a control law assuring lower losses for Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) and gas emissions.

In this paper, two novel PM tubular machines, i.e. partitioned stator interior permanent magnet (PS-IPM) and partitioned stator surface mounted permanent magnet (PS-SPM) tubular machines are proposed and optimised for maximum thrust force. Furthermore, the effect of main design parameters on the electromagnetic performances of two machines has been investigated. The influence of the magnet width to pole pitch ratio on the undesirable cogging force is also examined. It is found that the thrust force capability of the PS-IPM tubular machine is higher than that of the PS-SPM tubular machine, but the latter exhibits low cogging force. Both proposed machines show good thrust force capability, and in addition to this, the magnet demagnetisation risk is reduced since the magnets and the windings of the machines are separated from each other.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7112953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112953","","ISO;Air gaps;Lead","linear machines;machine theory;optimisation;permanent magnet machines;stators","tubular partitioned stator permanent magnet machines;permanent magnet linear machines;linear motion applications;high speed operation;partitioned stator interior permanent magnet;partitioned stator surface mounted permanent magnet;maximum thrust force;electromagnetic performances;pole pitch ratio;undesirable cogging force;magnet demagnetisation risk;machines windings;PS-IPM tubular machine;PS-SPM tubular machine","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In its armature the height of permanent magnets (PMs) is not the same as that of iron cores, which is different with conventional switched-flux motor (SFM). Firstly, a MTSFLM with the same tooth-slot parameters as the corresponding rotatory motor is showed, pointing out that its coil areas is much smaller than that of the rotatory form. The MTSFLM with 2.5 times high armature is discussed then to enlarger slot areas. Secondly, it is pointed out that MTSFLM with higher armature may lead to serious saturation if the height of iron core and the height of PMs are still kept the same as conventional design. A MTSFLM with shorter PMs, than the height of corresponding iron cores, in armature is proposed. And the height optimization of the PMs is then investigated to produce optimum output characteristics. Thirdly, the unique impacts of yoke height and gap distance on optimum PMs height value are discussed. Finally, a prototype with optimized structure parameters is presented.

In this paper, a nine-phase FSPM motor with triple star-winding sets spatially displaced by 40 degrees fed by three pulse-width modulated voltage source inverters (VSIs) is proposed, and the fault tolerant operation of the proposed FSPM motor is addressed. The key of this paper is to investigate two remedial strategies for fault-tolerant operation of the FSPM motor drive under open-circuit fault. Firstly, by isolating the faulty star-winding set, the torque pulsations due to phase loss can be remedied, the so-called remedial BLAC operation mode. Secondly, by injecting fifth and seventh harmonic currents to reconstruct armature fields, the low-frequency torque pulsation can also be remedied, the so-called remedial BLAC with harmonic current injection operation mode. Finally, these two remedial operation modes are compared and verified by simulation and experimental results, hence confirming the validity of the proposed fault-tolerant FSPM motor drive.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7112959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112959","flux-swiching permanent-magnet motor;nine-phase;remedial strategies;harmonic currents;BLAC;low-frequency","Torque;Harmonic analysis;Stators;Brushless motors;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Permanent magnet motors","brushless machines;fault tolerant control;harmonic analysis;losses;magnetic flux;motor drives;permanent magnet motors;PWM invertors;stators;torque motors","fault tolerant control;flux switching permanent magnet motor drives;open phase;stator-PM brushless machines;reliability;power density;nine-phase FSPM motor drives;triple star-winding set;pulse-width modulated voltage source inverters;PWM VSI;fault tolerant operation;open-circuit fault;phase loss;remedial BLAC operation mode;armature field reconstruction;low-frequency torque pulsation;harmonic current injection operation mode","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At high frequencies (HFs) of conducted EMI, the impedance of an EM insulation system fed from a VFD is small due to the parasitic capacitive couplings. Thus, the conducted EMI currents flow through the insulation into the other conductive parts of the machine or ground. This can cause damage to the insulation, accelerate corrosion and bearings, and influence other electrically and/or mechanically connected equipment in the system. In order to understand the phenomena of EMI and how to minimize it, one must understand parasitic capacitances in a VFD-cable-EM system. Many authors analyze the topic of parasitic capacitances of cables and machine's bearing capacitances. However, not many publications are focused on the detailed analysis of the windings. In most cases, the parasitic capacitances of the winding are represented as a part of a global equivalent RLC circuit. Some authors use simplified models such as solenoids, which are not adequate representatives of the actual winding topologies used in EMs. To date, not much attention is given to the actual distribution of parasitic capacitive couplings in the winding itself, especially for multi-layer coils. Therefore, it appears necessary to provide an overview of the models proposed in the literature and their implementation in the analysis of EMs. This paper presents capacitive couplings from the point of view of winding topology and conductor geometry, including insulation coating between conductors, and conductor and ground, which can be implemented in the winding equivalent RLC circuit, which can further be applied to analyze the machine's behavior at HFs. The discussion section at the end of this paper recommends further steps on how to determine the parasitic capacitive couplings in the future with more accuracy.","","978-1-4673-6785-1978-1-4673-6784","10.1109/EVER.2015.7112940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112940","electric machines;windings;coils;insulation system;capacitance;capacitive coupling;electromagnetic interference;variable-frequency drive","Pulse width modulation;Windings;Cable insulation;Capacitance;DH-HEMTs","conductors (electric);electric machines;electromagnetic interference;machine bearings;machine insulation;machine windings;RLC circuits;variable speed drives","winding;electrical machine;variable-frequency drive;electromagnetic interference;EM insulation system;parasitic capacitive coupling;conducted EMI currents flow;accelerate corrosion;mechanical connected equipment;electrical connected equipment;VFD-cable-EM system;cable;machine bearing;global equivalent RLC circuit;solenoid;multilayer coil;conductor geometry;insulation coating","","5","","56","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
