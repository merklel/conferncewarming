The air conditioning system for passenger comfort and the thermal conditioning system (battery and powertrain) are main auxiliary consumers in EVs with respect to energy consumption. Therefore, the Horizon 2020 project ""OPTEMUS"" proposes to tackle this bottleneck by leveraging low energy consumption and energy harvesting through a holistic vehicle-occupant-centred approach. This manuscript presents the approach of the project and first simulation results of the air conditioning system including a heat pump. This system is capable of using the ambient air or a preconditioned battery as heat source.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935949","electric vehicle;passenger comfort;thermal conditioning;heat pump system;battery as heat source","Batteries;Heat pumps;Atmospheric modeling;Energy consumption;Resistance heating;Integrated circuit modeling","energy consumption;hybrid electric vehicles","energy consumption;thermal conditioning;EV;air conditioning system;passenger comfort;thermal conditioning system;OPTEMUS;holistic vehicle-occupant-centred approach;heat pump;heat source","","3","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To minimise the environmental impact of a vehicle throughout its entire life cycle, the life cycle energy optimisation (LCEO) methodology has been proposed. Using the proxy of life cycle energy, this methodology balances the energy consumption of vehicle production, operation and end-of-life scenarios. The overall aim is to design a vehicle where life cycle energy is at a minimum. While previous work only included vehicle production and operation, this paper aims at advancing the LCEO methodology by including an end-of-life phase. A simplified design study was conducted to illustrate how vehicle design changes when end-of-life treatment is included. Landfilling, incineration and recycling have been compared as end-of-life treatments, although the focus was put on recycling. The results reveal that the optimal design not only changes with the inclusion of an end-of-life phase but it changes with specific end-of-life treatment.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935888","Life cycle energy;end-of-life;early-stage vehicle design;optimisation;functional conflicts","Biological system modeling;Recycling;Production","automobiles;design for environment;energy conservation;energy consumption;environmental legislation;incineration;optimisation;recycling","energy efficient early-stage vehicle design;end-of-life phase;life cycle energy optimisation methodology;LCEO methodology;environmentally-friendly energy-efficient vehicles;vehicle environmental impact;vehicle production energy consumption;landfilling;incineration;recycling","","","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The application of Internet of Things and Big Data technologies in electric vehicles enables the development of new methodologies for offering personalised energy efficiency advices. JOSPEL aims at exploiting all these possibilities making them tangible through an energy consumption reduction reached by means of the provision of different services and improving the physical elements in the vehicle.

This is crucial as Lithium-Ion battery cells result in reduced lifespans if exposed to temperatures above 50°C. On the other hand, temperatures below 10°C lead to a reduced capacity and with respect to electric vehicles in reduced driving ranges. The OPTEMUS project therefore develops a thermal insulating battery module housing that thermally disconnects the battery cells from the ambient temperature, providing a more stable temperature profile and more efficient thermal management of the battery. Different housing materials and designs have been developed to provide thermal insulating properties while also withstanding mechanical forces. Based on a concept module design of Fraunhofer LBF, two different fiber reinforced plastic sandwich structures have been manufactured with insulating foam cores and analyzed with respect to their cellular structures and resulting thermal properties. The cellular structure was detected three-dimensionally via computer tomography analysis. The manufactured sub-module housings were tested in a climatic chamber at -10°C and compared to a benchmark housing design based on aluminum as construction material. Results showed that the cell temperatures decrease 250 to 400 % slower using foam core sandwich structures as housing material compared to an aluminum housing while providing large scale manufacturability via the injection molding process.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935955","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935955","electric vehicle;battery thermal management;fiber reinforced plastics;sandwich structure;thermal insulation;injection moulding","Thermal management;Temperature distribution;Thermal stability;Injection molding;Temperature sensors","battery powered vehicles;computerised tomography;foams;insulating materials;thermal management (packaging)","insulating sandwich housing structures;thermal management;battery packs;electric vehicle battery thermal management systems;OPTEMUS project;insulating battery module housing;mechanical forces;Fraunhofer LBF;computer tomography;cellular structure","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The reduction in naturally aspirated engine power due to reduction of displacement is compensated by application of turbocharging. However, the downsizing of conventional engines implicates major challenges regarding longitudinal dynamic characteristics. An example of this circumstance is the delayed turbocharger-induced torque reaction which leads to a partially poor response behavior of the vehicle during acceleration operations (tubo-lag). It is important to focus conventional drive train design on real customer driving again. Electrification of the drive train increases the response behavior, while simultaneously CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reduced. Thus, an electric engine provides the desired torque almost without delay. The advantage over a conventional vehicle is particularly noticeable at low engine speeds. This paper complements current dynamic criteria (e.g. acceleration 0-100 kph, elasticity 80-120 kph) illustrated in manufacturer information by realistic acceleration maneuvers to objectify customer-oriented transient dynamics. As a result, longitudinal dynamics experienced by a driver is adequately described. In this contribution we present a simulation based method for evaluating these realistic dynamic criteria. This method extends an existing stationary total vehicle model by a specifically adapted engine torque gradient model to consider transient influences like the boost pressure of the turbocharger. This contribution focuses on an evaluation of electrified technical measures (e.g. use of 48V in combination with an electric charger) to strengthen the customer-oriented longitudinal dynamics in conventional vehicles. By applying the validated transient simulation tool we determine the extent to which the instantaneous torque response of conventional vehicles can be adapted to the torque response of fully electrified vehicles. Design measures (e.g. gear ratio and vehicle weight) and technical electrified measures (e.g. e-charger) both improve longitudinal response in daily driving situations. But for each vehicle design a varying set of measures improves dynamics best considering effectiveness.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935918","48V;customer-oriented dynamics;electric charger;electrified vehicles;total vehicle simulation;vehicle concepts","Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Monitoring;Acceleration;Resistance;Vehicle dynamics;Aerodynamics","automobile manufacture;compressors;consumer behaviour;electric vehicles;engines;fuel systems;gradient methods;vehicle dynamics","longitudinal dynamics;conventional vehicles;electrified vehicles;customer behavior;automobile manufacturers;fleet requirements;turbocharging;electric engine;torque gradient model","","1","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the supplying of power without disturbance is the main challenge for utilities, especially for systems that integrate fluctuating renewable sources which can cause voltage sag and swell. In this paper, voltage sag and swell issues are investigated. The first studied scenario is related to the disturbance of the energy source and the second one is due to the installation of a heavy load with a sensitive load at the same supplying bus. A D-STATCOM is connected at the point of common coupling (PCC) to mitigate the voltage sag and sell problems. An energy storage battery has been installed at the DC-side of the compensator that gives the possibility to control the voltage at the PCC and exchange the active and reactive power with the grid. A linear proportional integral (PI) feed-forward controller supervises the compensator. The obtained results show that the D-STATCOM compensator behaves as a good solution to mitigate the voltage sag and swell in distribution grid.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935917","Voltage sag;voltage swell;D-STATCOM;distributed generation;FACTS;feed-forward control;power quality","Automatic voltage control;Reactive power;Generators","distributed power generation;feedforward;linear systems;PI control;power grids;power supply quality;reactive power control;renewable energy sources;static VAr compensators","voltage sag mitigation;voltage swell mitigation;D-STATCOM compensator;renewable energy-based distributed generation system;energy source disturbance;heavy load installation;point of common coupling;PCC;energy storage battery;active power exchange;reactive power exchange;linear proportional integral feedforward controller;linear PI feedforward controller;distribution grid","","3","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It supplies a great number of loads and in a case of short circuit, a tripping switch should instantly disconnect the malfunctioning user and continue power supply action. A very high current is required to disconnect the tripping switch, thus an AC/DC/AC power electronic converter must be significantly over-dimensioned. During the short circuit, the bypass made of parallelly connected thyristors (direct converter type cycloconverter) connects the generator to the power electronic converter's output, thus the variable frequency and amplitude of the generator voltage is parallelly connected to the inverter.

The expansion of the graphite anode due to lithium intercalation, when charging, leads to a macroscopic expansion of the cell. State of the art rigid battery module bracing causes a periodic pressure build-up over a full charge/discharge cycle and therefore a compression of the battery separator. Furthermore, this results in a reduced diffusivity of the lithium-ions, which can cause lithium plating. Lithium plating is considered as the main cause of (premature) battery aging. In our paper, we present for the first time the investigation of a flexible spring-loaded cell bracing on cell aging by maintaining a nearly constant pressure. In comparison with the rigid bracing, a different aging speed can be observed in favour of the flexible bracing method.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935871","lithium-ion battery;mechanical stress;capacity fading;premature aging","Optical materials;Stress;Aging;Batteries;Materials testing","ageing;electrochemical electrodes;graphite intercalation compounds;lithium compounds;secondary cells","flexible battery module bracing;cell aging;lithium-ion battery cells;stacked configuration;wound configuration;coated electrodes;graphite anode expansion;lithium intercalation;full charge-discharge cycle;battery separator compression;lithium plating;flexible spring-loaded cell bracing;aging speed","","1","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currents in the damper cage influent the accuracy of the observed rotor position and speed severely. However, it is really difficult to measure the currents in the damper cage. According to the generation principle of the currents in the damper cage, the currents in the damper cage are higher harmonics. That's to say, the fundamental component of the stator currents become DC components under the rotor rotating coordination system, while the currents in the damper cage are still AC components. Therefore, if only the fundamental components of the stator currents, flux linkages, terminal voltage, etc. are considered, the currents in the damper cage can be ignored. Because the rotor position is only related to the fundamental component of the rotor PM flux linkage, an improved flux observer mathematical model is derived for the BLDC motor with a damper cage in this paper. The accuracy of the proposed flux observer is verified by both of numerical analysis results and experimental results.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935909","flux observer;mathematical model;PM AC motor;damper cage","Rotors;Magnetomechanical effects","AC motors;brushless DC motors;numerical analysis;observers;permanent magnet motors;rotors;sensorless machine control;stators","flux observer model;sensorless control;PM BLDC motor;damper cage;flux observer;permanent magnet AC motors;stator currents;rotor rotating coordination system;AC components;flux linkages;rotor PM flux linkage;numerical analysis","","1","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By the thrust ripple separation, the on-load thrust ripple is divided into three components, which stem from different causes respectively. Although the longitudinal end effect is the biggest cause, the DC current is another great factor because of the aggravated magnetic saturation level particularly under flux-weakening condition, which is totally different from traditional hybrid-excited machine. To on-load d-axis and q-axis (d-q) inductances, they also vary along with the increase of DC excitation current. Moreover, their difference is not zero and excitation level dependent, which indicating the on-load reluctance force cannot be neglected.

One major advantage of SRMs is that they have the lowest material costs. On the other hand, they suffer from relatively high torque ripples, which can make the motor noisy and less efficient. In this paper, the design and optimization of a 12/8 toothed SRM is presented. The goal of the optimization was to analyze and modify the motor geometry in order to optimize the average torque while trying to minimize the torque ripples at the same time. The first step of the optimization consisted in finding the optimum number of winding turns: 7, which was lower than that of the initial design and allowed the rotor diameter to be increased by 24.9%. This resulted in an increase in average torque of 38.3 % and a decrease in torque ripples of 17.3 %. The next steps consisted in changing the shape of the winding slots by varying other geometrical dimensions and the rotor tooth width. It resulted in a non-negligible additional reduction in torque ripples of 10.2 % and in an average torque further improved by only 2.4 %. This shows that increasing the rotor diameter is the most effective way to increase the torque from the initial design considered, while the other parameters were already quite well dimensioned in this initial design.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935928","Switched Reluctance Motor;electric and hybrid vehicle;design;optimization;number of turns;rotor diameter","Reluctance motors;Stator windings;Rotors;Torque;Optimization;Windings","electric vehicles;hybrid electric vehicles;reluctance motors;rotors","toothed SRM design optimization;switched reluctance motor design optimization;electric vehicle applications;hybrid electric vehicle applications;electric motor;high torque ripples;rotor diameter;winding slots;rotor tooth width","","1","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, it is proven that for the entire EV system, the input-to-state stability (ISS) property holds true with respect to arbitrary external inputs, namely the external mechanical torque on the car wheels and the internal battery voltage. Furthermore, it is shown that the system is ISS and its states converge to the equilibrium regardless from the way the controlled-inputs are constructed. This decisively enhances the overall design approach since it is proven that FLCs applied on the EV, simultaneously guarantee system stability.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935881","electric vehicle control;electric vehicle modelling;electrical drives;nonlinear analysis;fuzzy control","Stability analysis;Automobiles;State of charge;Inductance","controllers;electric vehicles;fuzzy control","fuzzy logic control;electric vehicles;complex electromechanical systems;control design;fuzzy logic controllers;FLC approach;input-to-state stability","","1","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although control study for wave energy converters is often limited to the hydrodynamic control, this paper addresses the dynamic modeling of all the conversion stages, from the waves to the electric network. First, the wave energy converter used for this study is presented and a model for the electric parts is proposed (including a back-to-back converter).

Most manufacturers select a long total gear ratio to achieve fuel savings by down speeding. The effects of the final drive ratio on improving fuel consumption in real customer driving, and subjectively perceivable longitudinal dynamics have hardly been considered so far. This paper studies the effect of varying the final drive of a vehicle on its fuel consumption and the driving experience in daily driving. Therefore we analyze two vehicles with different drive trains (Diesel and Gasoline) firstly with their initial and secondly with a modified final drive by applying (a) legally stipulated driving cycles, a aggregated daily driving cycle and (b) constant driving on a chassis dynamometer as well as (c) real driving situations. We quantify the impact of varying the final drive ratios on the fuel consumption in several driving cycles: the NEDC, the Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTC) and a highly dynamic driving cycle (HDDC), which corresponds to more dynamic driving behavior. Thus this HDDC comprises various route profiles depending on the driver type (city driver, commuter, long-distance driver). Additionally we carried out constantly driving phases at different velocities utilizing a chassis dynamometer to quantify consumption influences. Real driving situations complement these chassis dynamometer testing and enables evaluation of the effects of a higher final drive on the longitudinal driving dynamics in an objective (driving maneuvers) and a subjective manner (comprehensive volunteer study). The final drive has a large influence on the consumption in the NEDC for vehicles with a manual transmission. Real drivers on the other hand, only have a very small consumption advantage with a long total gear ratio. The real consumption effects are clearly better represented by the WLTP. Besides, through the use of shorter final drives the customer-relevant driving dynamics can be significantly improved.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935921","customer-oriented dynamics;highly dynamic driving cycle;NEDC;total vehicle simulation;vehicle concepts;WLTP","Gears;Vehicle dynamics;Fuels;Engines;Roads;Europe;Vehicles","automotive components;dynamometers;fuel economy;power transmission (mechanical);variable speed gear","automotive industry;total gear ratio;manual transmission;chassis dynamometer testing;WLTC;HDDC;highly dynamic driving cycle;Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicles Test Procedure;European Union;New European Driving Cycle;NEDC;constant driving;aggregated daily driving cycle;drive trains;fuel consumption;passenger car consumption;final drive ratio","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially in the operation of long-haul trucks, fuel costs have a huge impact on the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), which is the key entrepreneurial figure in the transportation business. Combined with route information, a Predictive Cruise Control (PPC) System increases the fuel-saving effects. In a MATLAB/Simulink model-based generic approach, the operating strategy and the PPC are optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The contradiction between minimizing the fuel consumption and simultaneously maximizing the vehicle speed in order to decrease time-related fixed costs has to be solved. This leads to a Multi-Objective Problem (MOP). The operating strategy is developed for a parallel hybrid topology that includes the fuel-saving functions of recuperating, boosting, shifting the load point (SLP) and electric drive only. The following methodology helps to answer the search for an optimum control parameter setup combining the operational strategy and the PPC System in long-haul operations. This paper describes the model building, simulation and optimization of a rule-based control strategy. The route profile and fuel consumption of an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) truck were measured in a real-life test run. The recorded data are used for model building and to validate the simulation tool. With an optimized parameter setup, fuel-saving effects of up to 11% with simultaneously increasing the vehicle speed were accomplished.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935872","genetic algorithm;multi-objective problem;operational strategy;predictive cruise control;coasting without drag torque;hybrid electric vehicle;full hybrid","Sorting;Optimization;Boosting;Lead;Control design;Drives;Resistance","fuel economy;genetic algorithms;hybrid electric vehicles;internal combustion engines;minimisation;power transmission (mechanical);road vehicles","long-haul truck hybrid operational strategy;multiobjective optimization;predictive powertrain control system;hybrid electric vehicle powertrain;HEV powertrain;fuel cost;total cost of ownership;transportation business;predictive cruise control system;fuel-saving effects;Matlab-Simulink model-based generic approach;genetic algorithm;GA;fuel consumption minimization;vehicle speed maximization;time-related fixed cost reduction;multiobjective problem;MOP;parallel hybrid topology;fuel-saving functions;rule-based control strategy;internal combustion engine truck;ICE truck;real-life test run","","5","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the dynamic model of an Interleaved Boost DC/DC Converter (IBC) is developed via the Energy Factor (EF) and sub-sequential parameters. In a DC/DC converter, the EF relates the stored energy to its dynamic characteristics, which helps in the converter design. In addition, the developed model enables to study the dynamic behavior of the converter based on its efficiency, taking into account iron and switching losses that are not fully considered in the standard model. The EF model is compared to the switched model and standard average small-signal model in the MATLAB/Simulink environment in order to verify the modeling approach.

The aim of this paper is to develop a dynamic, parameter based EoL model which will help to analyse the economy of battery end-of-Iife value chains and estimate the according residual value of the battery. In conclusion, the introduced model based on a cost benefit and net present value approach is capable to close the research gap.

Second-Life is already economically reasonable in 2016. The economy of Remanufacturing and Recycling is highly sensitive to the number of discarded batteries and Recycling will reach the break-even in the next 5 to 10 years.

The system consists of a Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery and an ultracapacitor. The scenario is a challenging use-case in public-transport in a large megacity - Istanbul, Turkey. Mobility data was recorded onsite and used for a holistic vehicle model in order to carry out long-term aging simulations. The goal was to find out if and to what extent aging can be reduced by adding an ultracapacitor unit. It was analyzed if this measure would economically be better than reducing the battery aging impact by oversizing the battery. Results show that a HESS can increase a battery unit's lifespan more cost effectively than the oversizing of the battery-only-storage, but not by a significant amount. The magnitude of the economic impact strongly depends on external factors, such as price fluctuations. Ultimately, it was found that the concept is not economically efficient, given the current technical and financial situation.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935873","hybrid energy storage;battery aging;electric vehicle;public transport;ultracapacitors","Supercapacitors;Batteries","ageing;lithium compounds;public transport;secondary cells;supercapacitors","aging-effects reduction;ultracapacitors;battery pack;hybrid energy storage system;lithium-ion battery;public-transport;Istanbul;Turkey;holistic vehicle model;long-term aging simulations;price fluctuations","","1","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More in particular, an IPMSM model (named IPMSM-1) derived from a commercial geometry equipped with a symmetrical winding is analyzed by using a Finite Element Method (FEM) approach. The simulation results regarding the cogging torque trend, the static characteristics and the related harmonic analysis are shown and discussed. Afterwards, two other IPMSM models with unsymmetrical windings are obtained by modifying the IPMSM-1 stator structure, but maintaining the same rotor configuration. FEM analysis are carried out also for these geometries and the related simulation results are compared with those obtained for the IPMSM-1 model. From this comparison it can be stated that the equipment of slightly unsymmetrical windings can be a viable choice during the design process of rotating electrical machines.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935908","Cogging torque;IPMSM;permanent magnets;FEM analysis;unsymmetrical windings","Windings;Finite element analysis;Reliability;Irrigation;Atmospheric modeling;Air gaps","finite element analysis;harmonic analysis;permanent magnet machines;rotors;stators;synchronous machines;torque","IPMSM finite element performance comparison;unsymmetrical double-layer winding;interior permanent magnet synchronous machine;cogging torque;torque-load angle characteristics;slot number-pole ratio;finite element method approach;harmonic analysis;IPMSM-l stator structure;rotor configuration;FEM analysis;rotating electrical machine design process","","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Linear analysis methods that are based mode shapes and participation factors are used to identify dynamic interaction in a hybrid ac-dc power system. The analysis uses as a test system a three terminal Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) based Multi-terminal High Voltage DC (MTDC) grid connecting three multi-machine asynchronous ac grids. The results show that there is some dynamic interaction between ac and dc grids under conventional MMC converter control structure, while the non-conventional MMC converter control structure decouples the ac and dc side of the MMC converter, thus avoiding interaction between the ac and dc grids.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935937","dc grids;hybrid ac/dc systems;MMC-MTDC;Small signal stability","Power system dynamics;Voltage control;Mathematical model;Generators;Rotors;Transient analysis;Turbines","HVDC power convertors;voltage-source convertors","AC/DC grid interaction;MMC based MTDC systems;MMC control structures;linear analysis methods;hybrid ac-dc power system;three terminal modular multilevel converter;multiterminal high voltage DC;multimachine asynchronous ac grids;MMC converter control structure","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study focuses on high-level control to keep DC voltage stable, mitigate oscillations due to the change in incoming power produced by contingencies in the AC grid and to provide the system with an adequate dynamic response [1]. Apart from this, controllers need to be validated in terms of HVAC grid compliance and for this purpose the UK National Grid Code will be used for verifying the fulfilment of frequency/voltage response and Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT). Thus, different tests will be performed considering the MTDC control objectives and the Grid Code compliance.","","978-1-5386-1692-5978-1-5386-1691-8978-1-5386-1693","10.1109/EVER.2017.7935938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935938","Multi-Terminal HVDC;high-level control;dynamic response;grid compliance;UK National Grid Code;Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT)","Voltage control;Frequency conversion;HVDC transmission;Frequency control;Power system stability;Wind farms;Reactive power","dynamic response;HVDC power convertors;HVDC power transmission;power grids;power system stability;power transmission control;voltage-source convertors","multiterminal HVDC-VSC transmission system integral control;MTDC system control structure;voltage source converter technology;VSC technology;oscillation mitigation;AC grid;dynamic response;UK National Grid Code;low voltage ride-through;frequency-voltage response;LVRT","","1","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
