However, these systems will be negatively affected by external factors such as climate changes and technical requirements for photovoltaic and wind systems in the future. In order to prevent negative effects on the system created by high voltage leaking, grounding resistance has to be checked periodically. High voltages on the electrical devices can cause possible intolerable problems when periodic checking is ignored. This study constitutes an important area in safety standards and applications. The purpose of this study is to measure the grounding resistance at short periods of time continuously to keep it constant at certain value. Hence, obtained grounding resistance value based on grounding standards on power plants is preserved. Moreover, necessary protection for Photo voltaic systems, people and equipment is provided automatically. Finally, experimental results show that the grounding resistance is monitored and kept as constant by the system designed.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844063","grounding resistance;soil resistivity;constant grounding resistance;renewable energy sources","Grounding;Resistance;Electrical resistance measurement;Current measurement;Voltage measurement;Soil;Inverters","earthing;photovoltaic power systems;renewable energy sources;wind power plants","power plants;electrical devices;high voltage leaking;wind systems;photovoltaic systems;grounding systems;Dspic;renewable energy sources;grounding resistance","","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to reach efficient power transfer through a large air gap between the windings of the wireless power transfer transformer, the principle of coupling magnetic resonance is used. Analysis of wireless charger battery coreless transformer of electric vehicle is performed through several simple and accurate expressions linked to the electric modeling. A capacitive compensation in primary and secondary winding is added to enhance the power transfer capability offering four topology cases (Parallel-Parallel, Series-Series, Series-Parallel, and Parallel-Series).

Consequently, it is required that the production, distribution and use of the energy should be as technologically efficient as possible and incentives to save energy at the end-user should also be strengthened.

When a planning of this kind of generation systems are carried out, the objectives of interest must be optimized based on outcome of each one, since join them in a single function is not always possible or recommend. In this paper a multi-objective optimization of a generation system is done, using as objectives the cost of energy, two different reliability indexes and the percentage of renewable energy used. The power generation system combines solar and wind energies, diesel generators as conventional source and the possibility to take energy from the grid. Each energy source and the load was modeled as a multi-state system (two or more performing levels), in order to represent in a closest form their variable nature. This multi-state representation of the generators and loads combined with the Universal Generating Function enables the estimation of the reliability indexes of the system, reducing the computation time, while maintaining adequate results. The proposed system was compared with Monte Carlo Simulation in the reliability assessment objective to evaluate the performance of the Universal Generating Function in this case. Finally the proposed system gives us as a result a variety of utilities that can serve as a basis for further evaluation in the whole planning process and it allows us to observe the changes produced on the solutions planning due to the impact of the renewable energies on reliability.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844008","power systems reliability;renewable generation;universal generating function;artificial intelligence","Reliability;Power system reliability;Optimization;Planning;Renewable energy sources;Indexes;Load modeling","diesel-electric generators;hybrid power systems;Monte Carlo methods;power generation planning;power generation reliability;power grids;renewable energy sources","hybrid renewable energy system;microgeneration system;renewable energies;reliability assessment;renewable resources;power generation system;solar energies;wind energies;diesel generators;universal generating function;Monte Carlo simulation","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of these technologies is the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), which makes use of vertical ocean temperature gradients to produce energy. Its resources are very large, but restricted to the tropical oceans. Here our objective is to map and discuss important characteristics of Northeast Brazil for OTEC's implementation. Instrumented buoys and model data are used to determine the spatial distribution and temporal variability of ocean resources, which extend from 0° to 24°S. ETOPO1 bathymetry data is further used to characterize the continental shelf and the location of shelfbreak canyons. Vertical temperature gradients time series for four submerged canyons (Natal, São Francisco, Japaratuba and Salvador) are selected for analysis.

This is especially known in South-East-Asian cities with strong motorcycle traffic [1]. But pure battery electric motorcycles have a significant range problem. This problem can be overcome with a hydrogen fuel cell hybrid system. Motorcycles in city driving have a very sharp load profile from extreme acceleration and sudden deceleration. To cater for this extreme load profile a triple hybrid systems with fuel cell, ultra capacitor and battery, have been developed and extensive tested. Tests of the triple hybrid system show a comparable acceleration and top speed performance in comparison to an battery - fuel cell only hybrid design. Additionally in the triple hybrid the load cycle energy on the hybrid battery can be reduced by 48% in exurban drive cycle test. An ultra capacitor - fuel cell hybrid only cannot provide the same performance as the triple hybrid or the battery - fuel cell hybrid.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844118","Electric vehicle;Fuel Cell Vehicle;Motorcycle;Hybrid","Fuel cells;Batteries;Capacitors;Motorcycles;Hybrid power systems;Acceleration;Hydrogen","battery powered vehicles;fuel cell vehicles;hybrid electric vehicles;motorcycles;supercapacitors","fuel cell triple hybrid drive train;electric drive;motorcycle traffic;pure battery electric motorcycles;hydrogen fuel cell hybrid system;ultracapacitor;load cycle energy","","1","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The developed study considers three different segmentation configurations, such that: (i) the radial segmentation, (ii) the axial segmentation, and (iii) the axial-skewed segmentation. The postprocessing of FEA models yields the time variation of eddy current loss in each PM segment as well as the loss density maps in the PMs for each segmentation configuration.

Contrary to the still mainstreaming passenger cars with internal combustion engine, electric cars do not necessarily depend on a CO<sub>2</sub>-emmitting process as power source if they are equipped with a charging interface for the internal battery. The fact that an infrastructure for electricity already exists is beneficial in terms of power availability and the possibility to use renewable energy sources for charging. But the challenging aspect is that the capacity of the electrical grid was originally neither designed for the additional load by electric vehicles nor for the simultaneously ongoing energy transition from conventional to renewable energy generation. However, the fact that an average vehicle is most of the time parking and potentially connected to the grid makes an electric vehicle flexible regarding the charging time schedule. This flexibility can be utilized in a smart grid context. Researchers are involved with this topic for several years now and many findings have already been published. The objective of this paper is to give an overview over already investigated problems and developed solutions.

For example, EVs operated in European countries require heating during the winter season, while those operated in equatorial regions face cooling load throughout the year. To date, the low range for a given battery charge remains the single-most important factor hindering the widespread acceptance of EVs. The principal electrical loads of an EV comprises of the traction and air-conditioning (A/C) compressor motors. These high power loads expedites the battery drain, leading to poor cruise range. The paper proposes a novel design solution geared towards improving the overall operating efficiency of these motors by integrating them into a single housing. The integrated unit is expected to operate close to 100 % efficiency during recuperation mode. The unprecedented improvement in efficiency is achieved through direct mechanical coupling of the traction motor with the A/C compressor during breaking events. The mechanical configuration of the unit is such that the torque and speed characteristics of traction and compressor motors can be independently controlled during drive mode. In addition to improved efficiency, the integrated unit boosts numerous other advantages such as increased reliability, compact design and weight saving.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844111","climatisation;regenerative braking;electric vehicle;integrated drive;A/C compressor;mechanical clutch","Traction motors;Vehicles;Batteries;Inverters;Blades;Static VAr compensators;Induction motors","air conditioning;battery chargers;compressors;electric vehicles;load (electric);traction motors","ecological vehicles;auxiliary units;traction shaft;electric vehicles;European countries;battery charge;principal electrical loads;air-conditioning compressor motors;A/C compressor;power loads;battery drain;direct mechanical coupling;traction motor;torque characteristics;speed characteristics","","1","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, a BMS of a battery pack in electric bicycles has no communication with chargers. In such system, the battery pack is charged without taking the voltage of individual cells into account and such system works well when charging with normal charging current level. In contrast, for fast charging, one cell may suffer overvoltage rapidly during charging with high current. This can lead to shortened life-time or sudden damage of the battery. In order to avoid the mentioned problem, the charging process is executed using measured data from the BMS. The developed charger adjusts the charging current to the maximum possible limit corresponding to the voltage of the cell which has the highest voltage in the pack, so that no individual cell suffers overvoltage during charging. The proposed scheme was implemented and tested.

This paper proposes a control strategy, applied on a 3-phase 6/5 DC-excited FSM for traction applications. To obtain the non-linear magnetic behavior of the machine, 2D finite element method (FEM) simulations are performed. The controller regulates the DC field current before reaching base speed to minimize the iron and copper losses. Due to the high armature reaction of the motor the speed range is extended by limiting both the field and armature currents as a function of the speed and inverter supply voltage.

In low power applications, the IM is associated to two level inverters, while in medium and high power applications it is associated to multi-level inverters, particularly the three level NPC topology. The paper deals with the adaptation of a DTC strategy following the reconfiguration from three to two legs of a three level inverter fed IM drive. A special attention is paid to the synthesis of the vector selection table, in so far as the number of the generated voltage vectors is reduced to nine, six among them are of half type, two are intermediate, and a null one, resulting in a limitation of the freedom degrees.

The consequent power drop can be avoided by using power optimizers, which are module dedicated dc/dc converters, or micro-inverters. The main drawbacks of such devices are the high cost and the reduced plant efficiency during the day hours in which the PV array works under a uniform irradiation level. This usually happens in the middle of the day, just when the PV power reaches the peak. Moreover, both the dc/dc and the dc/ac module dedicated converters introduce further components that may reduce the system lifetime, e.g. large electrolytic capacitances. A recent alternative is represented by the dynamical re-configuration of the PV array by means of active switches: in this way, the efficiency under uniform irradiation conditions is preserved and, in presence of mismatching, the best series/parallel modules configuration is achieved. This solution is cheaper than the one involving power optimizers and, besides the possibility of plant monitoring, offers additional advantages in terms of safety in case of fire. In this paper a novel approach to the PV string dynamical reconfiguration is presented and discussed.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6843998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6843998","Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT);mismatching;grid connected PV systems","","DC-AC power convertors;DC-DC power convertors;invertors;maximum power point trackers;microswitches;photovoltaic power systems;power semiconductor diodes","fast dynamical reconfiguration algorithm;PV arrays;power-versus-voltage characteristic;bypass diodes;centralized maximum power point tracking algorithms;CMPPT;consequent power drop;power optimizers;micro inverters;plant efficiency reduction;uniform irradiation level;DC-DC module dedicated converters;DC-AC module dedicated converters;system lifetime reduction;electrolytic capacitances;active switches;plant monitoring;PV string dynamical reconfiguration","","3","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our analysis finds that alternative drive concepts hold a high potential for future railway vehicles, depending on the boundary conditions.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6843995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6843995","railway;life cycle costs;alternative propulsion;fuel cell;battery electric;simulation","Vehicles;Batteries;Rail transportation;Propulsion;Fuel cells;Fuels","battery powered vehicles;fuel cell vehicles;propulsion;railway rolling stock","propulsion systems;techno-economic evaluation;heavy railway vehicles;nonelectrified railway route;propulsion component;battery electric multiple-unit;fuel cell multiple-unit;benchmark diesel multiple-unit;Deutsche Bahn BR 612;drivetrain layout","","2","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper explores the possible synergy between these players so as to jointly improve the production predictability while ensuring a low carbon mobility. First a context is defined for this collaboration. It consists in the association of a photovoltaic producer and some electric vehicles owners so as to both manage the EV recharge and meet a day-ahead production commitment. Several currently studied questions such as commitment strategies or optimal charging can be transposed into the proposed context called collaborative system. Here, we mainly focus on its sizing in terms of PV rated power and number of vehicles. A simplified model of the system is thus realised, including a day ahead commitment and an optimal vehicle charging planning, based on deterministic vehicle characteristics. First results show a strong influence of the sizing on the potential added value of vehicles in this association. Then, we assess the impact of day-ahead production forecast quality by comparing persistence forecast with some meteorological data. It appears that other things remaining equal, an imprecise forecast will increase the optimal number of vehicles that are supposed to get into the collaborative system. Finally, the robustness of the charging planning is investigated.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844110","photovoltaic energy;electric vehicle;collaborative system;production forecast;smart charging;sizing;power generation planning;production commitment","Collaboration;Production;Electric vehicles;Photovoltaic systems;Context","battery powered vehicles;photovoltaic power systems;power generation planning","preliminary sizing;collaborative system;photovoltaic power plant;electric vehicle fleet;photovoltaic generation;electric power system;synergy;production predictability;low-carbon mobility;photovoltaic producer;EV recharge;day-ahead production commitment;commitment strategies;optimal charging;optimal vehicle charging planning;deterministic vehicle characteristics;day-ahead production forecast quality;meteorological data","","3","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the study revealed that even though solar energy resources were abundant in the summer, high ambient temperatures drastically hindered the overall system performance for the given system components and reduced the solar cell efficiency by up to 16%.

However, in the last couple of years larger PV power plants in the range of 100MW have been installed and set in operation. An important question that arises for very large scale PV power systems is the optimization of the overall system configuration, especially due to the very high initial costs and the financing of such projects. Several concepts in the literature have been investigated regarding efficiency and technical feasibility; however it is also important to evaluate their economic feasibility, using commonly accepted metrics. In this paper four different system configurations are presented, with the typical system configuration of central inverters and medium voltage transformers used as a reference. The other three alternatives include high power DC-DC converters connected in series or in parallel, as well as cascaded DC-AC inverters. In addition, taking into account current developments in energy storage, new possibilities for combining PV with energy storage for large scale plants are rising, in order to deal with the grid integration of ever increasing PV installations. Therefore, a comparison is performed among a PV power plant with and without energy storage for different operation scenarios. The results show clearly the increase of cost and indicate the need for new evaluation metrics to include the expected benefits from the integration of energy storage to PV power systems.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844135","Very Large Scale PV systems;DC-DC Converter;Cascaded DC-AC;Energy Storage;Techno-economic evaluation;LCOE","Energy storage;Inverters;Power generation;Arrays;Economics;Measurement;Temperature sensors","DC-AC power convertors;DC-DC power convertors;invertors;photovoltaic power systems;power generation economics;power grids;power transformers;thermal energy storage","techno-economic evaluation;alternative configurations;very large scale PV power systems;energy storage;PV power plants;overall system configuration optimization;economic feasibility;technical feasibility;central inverters;medium voltage transformers;high power DC-DC converters;cascaded DC-AC inverters;grid integration;PV installations;power 100 MW","","7","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transition away from traditional use of biomass for cooking and heating in developing countries, to more efficient, modern uses with less negative impacts on the local environment, is also an important measure on the way towards sustainable use of energy.

Participating companies can succeed only through (disruptive) innovation, and only through entering industrial fields which are either new as such or new to the participants. Consequently, on supply level, car manufacturers have teamed up with battery-, electric motor- and power electronics manufacturers, as well as with electricity utilities and charging infrastructure suppliers. On operational level, ICT services providers, charging providers and parking services providers have started collaboration. However, the integration of electric vehicles into smart grids and smart cities is slow, even if most desirable from an environmental point of view. Meanwhile, high procurement costs and a lack of range continue to cripple the growth of electric car sales. Thus, from a business point of view, the most urgent research questions are (1) what actually is the EMBE, which actors are involved already and which will be involved in the future; (2) what challenges keep the EMBE from growing; and (3) which scientific theories are at researchers' disposal for studying the various challenges? In this paper I sketch an initial EMBE and - based on a review of various organisation theories and frameworks - propose an initial agenda addressing research needs that may have been missed in the ongoing scientific discourse on electric mobility. In conclusion, organisation theory can be used to model the EMBE and also to study why disruptive innovations are needed and which mechanisms prevent them.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844046","electric mobility;business ecosystem;organisation theory;electric vehicle;organisational behaviour","Ecosystems;Business;Technological innovation;Ice;Batteries;Electricity;Modeling","automobiles;electric motors;electric vehicles;industrial economics;organisational aspects;procurement;secondary cells;smart power grids","disruptive innovation;procurement cost;organisation framework;organisation theory;electric car sale growth;smart grids;electric vehicle integration;parking service provider;ICT service provider;operational level;power electronic manufacturer;electric motor;battery;car manufacturer;industrial field;EMBE;electric mobility business ecosystem","","2","","66","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most challenging requirement for wind energy converter systems is the low voltage ride through capability that expects generators to remain connected during symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults and to contribute to the system recovery. Asymmetrical voltage conditions and dips in the grid can have significant negative effects on the performance of doubly-fed induction generators. These effects can decrease the lifetime of sensitive components in the wind energy converter in the long term and in extreme cases they can cause damages and tripping of the system, leading to violation of the grid code requirements. Protective measures must be taken so that the wind energy converters remain connected and support the grid without putting the reliability of the system at risk. Various control solutions have been developed to deal with these challenges. Although the most common voltage dips caused by grid faults are asymmetrical, the majority of the control solutions developed so far consider only symmetrical faults and they cannot mitigate the problems faced under asymmetrical conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of different linear vector control methods for wind energy converter systems with doubly-fed induction generators which have been proposed in the literature to deal with the challenge of operating during voltage asymmetry and `riding-through' all types of voltage dips, symmetrical and asymmetrical.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844083","doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG);wind energy;grid integration;energy conversion;low voltage ride through (LVRT);asymmetrical faults;voltage unbalance;current control;power control;voltage dips;control system;resonant controllers;linear control;double synchronous reference frame (DSRF);single synchronous reference frame (SSRF)","Stators;Rotors;Voltage control;Torque;Voltage fluctuations;Circuit faults;Oscillators","asynchronous generators;electric current control;machine vector control;power control;power generation faults;power grids;wind power plants;wind turbines","DFIG-based wind turbines;unsymmetrical grid faults;wind power;distributed generation sources;grid code requirements;wind energy converter systems;low voltage ride through capability;asymmetrical grid faults;asymmetrical voltage conditions;voltage dips;doubly-fed induction generators;linear vector control methods","","12","","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given an extended, stable floating platform to share, important economies of renewable power production and energy storage are possible. The Pneumatically Stabilized Platform (PSP) embodies such a platform. Developed with USDARPA support and proved in model scale, the PSP will achieve its at-sea motion stability and structural loads mitigation by decoupling the “hull” from ocean wave pressures through the partial use of air buoyancy. In addition to supporting an array of WTs, the PSP deploys along its seaward edge the “Rho-Cee” WEC, termed the “Impedance-Matched Terminator”; comprising a nested set of tuned OWC absorbers, resonant across a selected frequency band. By means of impedance matching, highly efficient wave energy absorption is demonstrably achieved. As the characteristic impedance of ocean waves is small (denoted ρC, the product of water mass density and wave celerity - hence the name), the system's input impedance, equally small, must be that presented by a resonant response.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844053","","Wind turbines;Impedance;Maintenance engineering;Concrete;Wind;Buoyancy;Personnel","maintenance engineering;ocean waves;offshore installations;optimisation;reinforced concrete;wave power generation;wind power plants","offshore wind power;offshore wave power;floating platform;renewable power production;energy storage;pneumatically stabilized platform;USDARPA;motion stability;structural loads mitigation;ocean wave pressures;Rho-Cee;impedance-matched terminator;OWC absorbers;impedance matching;water mass density;wave celerity;resonant response;cost model;optimization;power take-off equipment;WEC structure;maintenance;clipping effect;prestressed reinforced concrete;sea water;WT systems;platform-resident personnel;breakwater;compressed-air potential energy;air-buoyancy control;distribution system","","1","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the SPSMC laws elaborated by several authors, just the slide surface tracking conditions are elaborated using Lyapunov functions, and the boundedness of the DFIG states is never treated. Some works have validated theirs approaches by experiments results in case of specified machines and steady-states points, but these verifications stays insufficient to generalize to other machines and steady-states points range. Adding to this argument, the DFIG states boundedness demonstration is widely suggested in goal to ensure that in the application of the SPSMC, the states evaluates within theirs tolerable bounds. Our objective in the present paper consists to highlight the efficiency of the SPSMC by stability analysis. The boundedness of the DFIG states such as the stator powers and rotor flux is discussed.

The typical cycle time of ocean waves is 5-7 seconds with subharmonic wave train fluctuations of 30-200 sec. These slow power fluctuations may cause significant thermal cycling of the IGBT powered inverter, with reduction in lifetime as result. In this work the Fred Olsen WEC system is used as a staring point, and a detailed thermal model for the inverter is implemented and simulated.

This annual data is related to the measurements of 2011, from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. There are two important aspects of the study. First one is related to calculation of the statistical parameters for wind speed data. Here four parameters of a statistical distribution are calculated. These are mean value, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis. Last two parameters are used to determine the non-Gaussian (or Gaussian) characteristics. In this study, the skewness and kurtosis parameters are are calculated and compared. Parameters indicate asymmetrical and non-Gaussian characteristics. Hence the wind speed distribution is defined by Weibull distribution and its probability density function is shown for shape parameter and average speed of the wind. Thus the histogram and Weibull probability density function are calculated as well as the statistical findings. As a second aspect of the study, data is accepted as non-stationary. So its Continuous Wavelet Transform is used for the determination of the seasonal transitions and determined the time-frequency content. Thanks to the continuous wavelet transform, low and high frequency regions of wind speed data are distinguished.

We assume that diagnostic, i.e. medical one, can be improved if the pattern is comprised by most of the significant environmental features. In our study, common sequence measures were employed to determine the saliency of a wide range of applications in the area of ecology, computational biology, as well as string editing, pattern recognition, etc. We assume that an important common sequence salience measure is to find the longest common subsequence for a set of n sequences. In order to perform this hard task, we use discrete event formalism, respectively Petri nets and we propose an algorithm for reducing the size of the digraphs. An interesting application to the ECG signals measured on five patients who leave in a polluted area of Romania will demonstrate that salient input features effectively aid the medical diagnosis process.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844141","diagnosis;discrete event systems;Petri nets;longest common subsequences","Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Firing;Standards;Polynomials;Random variables;Pollution measurement","discrete event systems;electrocardiography;environmental factors;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;pattern recognition;Petri nets;signal classification","discrete event diagnosis;automated environment impact diagnosis;human health;environmental features selection;environmental features classification;ecologic features;computational biology;string editing;pattern recognition;sequence salience measure;discrete event formalism;Petri nets;digraphs;ECG signals;polluted area;Romania;salient input features;medical diagnosis process","","","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a technique is based on the coupled use of two control techniques. The first one is a MPPT technique which is distributed on all the PV modules of the field and which properly regulates the operating voltage of each PV module. It is called Distributed Maximum Power Point Tracking (DMPPT) technique because it is carried out by means of suitable DC/DC converters (microconverters) which are distributed on all the PV modules of the array. The second control technique is called Central Maximum Power Point Tracking (CMPPT) technique because it is carried out by the central inverter which properly regulates the operating voltage of the whole PV array. The adoption of a HMPPT technique is necessary because, in order to extract the maximum available energy from a PV system operating in mismatching conditions, the proper regulation either of the PV modules voltages or of the DC inverter input voltage is necessary. One possible HMPPT technique adopts a Perturb & Observe (P&O) based DMPPT technique and a CMPPT technique which is based on the periodic sweep of the power versus voltage characteristic at the input of the inverter. Such a HMPPT technique is characterised by two major drawbacks: the waste of available energy during the sweep and the relatively low tracking speed. In this paper a new algorithm, called Fast Estimate of the Maximum Power Voltages (FEMPV), which can be profitably used in HMPPT applications in order to overcome the above drawbacks will be discussed. The case of microconverters based on the adoption of the buck, boost and buck-boost topology will be studied in detail.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844109","Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT);Hybrid MPPT (HMPPT);mismatching;grid connected PV systems","Vehicles;Voltage control;Inverters;Switches","invertors;maximum power point trackers;photovoltaic power systems","microconverters based PV applications;photovoltaic systems;mismatching conditions;hybrid maximum power point tracking technique;PV modules;operating voltage;distributed maximum power point tracking technique;DC/DC converters;central maximum power point tracking technique;central inverter;PV array;DC inverter input voltage;perturb & observe based DMPPT technique;CMPPT technique;fast estimate of the maximum power voltages;FEMPV;buck-boost topology","","1","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main challenges related with multi-terminal HVDC grids are market and regulatory issues, control and coordination of the grid, and protection and circuit-breakers. This article focuses on the technical challenges, especially those in relation with DC voltage control and power flow balancing. Several studies have proposed different methods for controlling the DC voltage in MTDC grids. This article uses a DC voltage droop control scheme. The system is analysed by means of simulations and experimentally in a down-scaled laboratory model with ratings in the range of 60 kVA. In order to evaluate the robustness of the droop-control strategy, several large disturbances are emulated: abrupt variation in wind production, sudden change in droop line set-points and loss of two converter terminals during full wind production.

In some places the groundwater resources are brackish, which means that it is of high salinity and undrinkable unless it is desalinated. Brackish Water Reverse Osmosis (BWRO) desalination is a method that can be applied to produce potable water from saline groundwater resources. This requires electricity to drive the high pressure pumps that enable reverse osmosis. In this article, a preliminary BWRO plant design for a village in Paraguay is presented, supplied by a stand-alone PV system with battery storage. The energy requirement of the desalination plant is estimated for sizing the power supply and storage systems. Two different load profiles are evaluated by simulations in PVsyst; the first scenario is based on constant load for maximum utilization of the membrane capacity, while the second scenario is based on partly adapting the load to the solar irradiation. The second scenario implies an increase of the plant size, since parts of the plant are stopped during nighttime, but allows for reducing the battery capacity since more of the energy for desalination is used when it is directly available from the PV system. The presented results demonstrate how system designs that allow for operation schemes with reduced freshwater production during the night will be economically beneficial due to a larger reduction in investment cost for battery storage than the cost increase due to larger membrane installation.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844059","Brackish Water Reverse Osmosis;Stand-alone PV System;Load Profile;System Design","Desalination;Batteries;Production;Radiation effects;Reverse osmosis;Feeds","battery storage plants;desalination;photovoltaic power systems;reverse osmosis","drinking water;brackish water reverse osmosis desalination;BWRO desalination;saline groundwater resources;BWRO plant design;Paraguay;stand-alone PV system;battery storage;desalination plant;power supply;load profiles;membrane capacity;solar irradiation;battery capacity;freshwater production;investment cost reduction","","2","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This low cost position measurement solution requires a specific control strategy. That has been developed for a three-phase 6/4 SRM. It begins with a rotor alignment step intending to bring the rotor to a known position. Afterward, only one phase is supplied on a periodic basis, to drive the rotor in the desired direction and accelerate up to a predefined speed threshold. Thus, the proposed procedure drastically simplifies the control strategy and permits a low cost sensor based control. 2D Finite Elements simulations are performed to analyze the starting performances in terms of response time and power efficiency. Both electrical and mechanical transients are considered in the simulation model thanks to simplifying assumption which consists in applying a time averaged voltages instead of instantaneous switching. Finally, the entire starting procedure with a one phase supply procedure is tested experimentally.

However, PI control has a lower performance when it is used in complex and nonlinear systems. Fuzzy logic controller (FLC) has best performances, even in case of strongly nonlinear systems. Therefore, the combination of these two controllers to form a fuzzy supervisory control (FSC) can give better performance to overcome the limitation of PI control in nonlinear systems. In this paper a novel FSC control method is proposed. The FSC performs closed loop control of the output current to improve the performance of the MC powered by unbalanced grid voltage.

The paper describes the machine topologies, winding configurations, electromagnetic performance, torque/power density, and efficiency, as well as acoustic noise and vibration, together with a comparison with Toyota Prius interior permanent magnet machines in terms of torque/power speed characteristics and efficiency.","","978-1-4799-3787-5978-1-4799-3786","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844161","electrically excited;permanent magnet;switched reluctance;synchronous reluctance;wound field","Torque;Stator windings;Rotors;Windings;Reluctance machines;Harmonic analysis","machine windings;permanent magnet machines;reluctance machines;rotors;stators","stator electrically field excited synchronous machines;salient pole rotors;rotor wound field machines;switched reluctance machines;synchronous reluctance machines;machine topologies;winding configurations;electromagnetic performance;power density;torque density;acoustic noise;vibration;Toyota Prius interior permanent magnet machines","","9","","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
