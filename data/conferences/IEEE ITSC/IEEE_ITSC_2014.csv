And the traditional control strategies for single intersection or regional multiple intersections have been confirmed to have some effect in the past few decades, but still need to be improved. Based on ACP (Artificial societies, Computational experiments, Parallel execution) idea, we firstly proposed the concept of “event agent” in this paper, which refers to the ratings that traffic states give corresponding timing plans. Based on event agent, we used computational methods to establish a Parallel transportation Management Systems (PtMS), which was a self-completing system. In the system plenty of artificial events were generated, and some of them can not only simulate the actual traffic events, but also be substitutes for the actual events. Then through the parallel execution between actual and artificial events, the system recommends the most suitable timing plans to the current traffic state. Different from traditional control strategies, event agent based PtMS takes results as an orientation according to the idea of data-driven, which is more adaptive to the characteristics of transportation systems. For ensuring the validity and accuracy of experiments, our related data are all based on the famous traffic micro-simulation software Paramics. Furthermore, we compared our method with the classic Webster method, and experiments achieved good results.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958153","ACP;data-driven;event agents;Intelligent Transportation Systems;parallel transportation management system","Vehicles;Roads;Delays;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling","intelligent transportation systems;road traffic control","parallel management;traffic signal control;urban vehicles;traffic congestion;ACP;artificial societies;computational experiments;parallel execution;parallel transportation management systems;PtMS","","1","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed approach treats the traffic data including observed data and missing data as a whole data item and restores the complete data with the deep structural network. The deep learning approach can discover the correlations contained in the data structure by a layer-wise pre-training and improve the imputation accuracy by conducting a fine-tuning afterwards. We analyze the imputation patterns that can be realized with the proposed approach and conduct a series of experiments. The results show that the proposed approach can keep a stable error under different traffic data missing rate.

This is generally calculated using sensors and/or V2V communication to determine the state of nearby vehicles, and by performing a future projection of the state to estimate a collision. This paper introduces a technique using a digital map to incorporate features of the road environment into the vehicle model, providing constraints on the potential vehicle motion. This model provides an estimate of the `real' minimum distance between vehicles given the road environment, the likely mode of interaction, and an estimate of the Time To Interaction (TTI) between a pair of vehicles. The metrics provide a high level estimate regarding the potential for future vehicle interactions, which can be augmented by incorporating additional measures of estimated driver intention. The metrics can also be incorporated into low level collision avoidance systems as a filter for vehicles that should not be considered a threat due to map constraints, which reduces the likelihood of false positives.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957827","","Vehicles;Roads;Sensors;Collision avoidance;Safety;Time measurement","intelligent transportation systems;road vehicles","intelligent transportation systems;ITS;time to collision;TTC;digital map;road environment;vehicle model;time to interaction;TTI","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We estimate Time Dependent Origin Destination (TDOD) demand matrices by a bi-level optimization problem and manually adjust supply parameters afterward. The calibration procedure and relative effectiveness of the iterative demand-supply calibration compared with demand-only calibration is investigated via a real network coded in VISUM. Link traffic volumes are used as measures of performance to compare observed and estimated values. The output of this paper is a guideline to calibrate macroscopic DTA models which can be used (i) for deployment of intelligent transportation systems, (ii) as an initial solution in on-line systems to efficiently combine historical and real-time data and provide more accurate anticipatory information, and (iii) appraise subsequent network performance and predict consequences of various traffic management strategies.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958003","","Calibration;Data models;Estimation;Optimization;Vehicles;Joints","calibration;direction-of-arrival estimation;intelligent transportation systems;iterative methods;matrix algebra;optimisation;road traffic;supply and demand;transportation","off-line calibration;iterative demand-supply parameters estimation;macroscopic dynamic traffic assignment model;complex transportation networks;traffic conditions;future network states forecast;macroscopic DTA model;off-line environment;time dependent origin destination;TDOD demand matrices;bilevel optimization problem;iterative demand-supply calibration;demand-only calibration;VISUM;link traffic volumes;intelligent transportation systems;online systems;traffic management strategies","","2","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, LED text recognition still remains a challenge due to its different types and consisting of discontinuous character. Therefore, this work addresses a method to recognized LED text contained on electronic road sign, as an application to intelligent transportation systems (ITS).Our proposed method extracts supporting points representing as a center of LED segment on binary map of the input image. Character region generating is applied using density-based spatial region generation (DBSREN) method. The spatial information of each point contained on region is utilized for acquiring region feature. Nearest Cluster Neighbor (NCN) classifier is then used for training as well as recognizing stage. In experiment, our method achieves 87.4% and 61% of detection and recognition rate, respectively. The processing time is almost 12 frames per second.

In this paper we propose an emergency vehicle signal coordination (EVSC) approach, which is intended to provide “green wave” for EVs. Traffic simulations are conducted along an emergency corridor with 8 intersections in Qingdao, China. Multiple traffic measurements are compared between simulation outputs with and without EVSC operation.

The proposed system provides an efficient and practical solution to such request, and also shows technical advances compared to earlier systems. It utilizes the lane markings for camera orientation calibration. At each image frame, multiple vanishing points of the lane markings are estimated using the weighted least squares method, followed by a tracking process with Kalman Filter for better consistency and robustness. With the filtered vanishing point the camera extrinsic tilt and pan angles can be estimated. Even though the proposed system relies on the lane markings for calibration, unlike other similar systems, the number of the lane markings in the system is not restricted, and the shape of the lane markings is also not restricted to straight lines or any other pre-defined models. A Monte Carlo evaluation scheme is devised for that purpose using real world driving sequences. The final result has shown that given an initial calibration error, in ±4 degree interval w.r.t. ground truth for both tilt and pan angles, the proposed system is capable of converging to accurate angles and providing consistent results.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957643","","Cameras;Calibration;Estimation;Vehicles;Equations;Mathematical model;Kalman filters","calibration;cameras;computerised instrumentation;Kalman filters;least squares approximations;Monte Carlo methods;vehicles","automatic online camera calibration system;vehicular applications;Advanced Driver Assistance System;weighted least squares method;tracking process;Kalman filter;filtered vanishing point;Monte Carlo evaluation scheme;tilt angles;pan angles","","1","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the rapid development of intelligent transportation, the technology of vehicle-vehicle communication provides a new way for this problem. The paper proposed a set of rules to clarify the sequence of vehicles to pass through uncontrolled intersection. The rules are planned based on the law of road traffic safety. According to the rules, each approaching car makes decision for preempting or yielding other cars based on the information from vehicle-vehicle communication. If the approaching car needs to yield other cars, we propose an algorithm to find a proper deceleration value to do yielding. The car brakes automatically using this deceleration value to avoid collision with other cars. After all, the tests were done to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and demonstrate the function among the connected vehicles in intersection. The rule based collision avoidance algorithm can provide real-time collision detection and make safe deceleration for the cars crossing the uncontrolled intersection.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957676","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957676","","Vehicles;Collision avoidance;Safety;Roads;Acceleration;Trajectory","automobiles;brakes;collision avoidance;intelligent transportation systems;mobile radio;optimisation;road safety","rule-based control algorithm;connected vehicles;uncontrolled intersection;optimization;intersection structure;additional traffic signal layout;intelligent transportation;vehicle-vehicle communication;road traffic safety;car;brakes;deceleration value;collision avoidance algorithm;real-time collision detection","","4","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eleven participants completed 141 logged journeys, with results showing that range (as predicted by the EV and presented to the driver) was overestimated by approximately 50% in comparison to journey distance. Driving style had the most significant impact on range prediction accuracy, where a more aggressive driving style led to greater inaccuracies. However, journey distance and type of road driven, which can be calculated from Satnav systems, were factors which were correlated with having a significant effect on range accuracy. Therefore incorporating these into future range prediction algorithms has the potential to increase the accuracy of information and subsequently increase driver trust.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958105","Electric vehicle;Driver behaviour;Driver information systems;Intelligent transportation systems;Range anxiety;Range accuracy;Real-World driving","Accuracy;Vehicles;Batteries;Temperature distribution;Roads;Data collection;Estimation","electric vehicles;intelligent transportation systems;road vehicles","electric vehicle range estimation accuracy;ITS;EV driver;Satnav system;range prediction algorithm;intelligent transportation system","","10","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The previous works mainly focus on detecting and recognizing traffic sign based on images captured by onboard camera. Visual features of traffic sign such as color, shape, and appearance, however, are often sensitive to illumination condition, angle of view, etc. Except for camera, LIDAR also provides important and alternative features of traffic sign. The fusion of complementary data acquired from both sensors can improve the robustness of the algorithm, especially when data from either of them are of low quality. For this reason, we propose a new traffic sign detection and recognition algorithm based on the fusion of camera and LIDAR data. Specifically, position prior, color, laser reflectivity, and 3D geometric features are integrated to detect traffic sign in a 3D space. In most of previous works, different colors of traffic signs are individually handled in a specific color space, which generally results in the use of many thresholds or multiple classifiers. In this paper, we use combined color spaces (CCS) such that traffic sign colors can be entirely treated as one class. For traffic sign recognition, in order to improve the robustness to any viewpoint variation, regions of interest (ROIs), which suffer from perspective deformation, are rectified first by fusing LIDAR and camera data. Then the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature and linear support vector machines (SVMs) are used to classify traffic signs. Finally, extensive experimental results in challenging conditions show that our algorithm is real-time and robust.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957752","","Image color analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Reflectivity;Cameras;Laser radar;Lasers;Laser noise","cameras;image capture;image classification;image colour analysis;image fusion;intelligent transportation systems;object detection;optical radar;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing","vision-based real-time traffic sign detection algorithm;vision-based real-time traffic sign recognition algorithm;intelligent vehicle;complementary data fusion;camera data fusion;LIDAR data fusion;laser reflectivity;3D geometric features;combined color spaces;traffic sign colors;regions of interest;histogram of oriented feature;HOG feature;linear support vector machines;SVM","","17","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional offline testing method, which used to be widely used in train control system's functional conformance testing, however, is no longer suitable. Especially with the increasing system complexity and more information interaction to its outer environment, the offline testing is apparently insufficient to describe the non-deterministic latency restrictions. In this paper, we proposed an online testing method, which is suitable for generating and executing test case together and solves the problem of real-time performance testing. Firstly, we used timed automata theory to model a typical scenario of RBC handover process. Secondly, the above-mentioned TA network is divided by observable message channels into two parts, the environment model part and the equipment model part, which both work as the testing specifications of real implement. Thirdly, we used black-box conformance testing tool UPPAAL-TRON to generate and execute “online” test cases automatically. Specifically, this paper studied the case of RBC handover scenario, and concentrated on non-deterministic time delay performance of crossing interlock messages and wireless messages.

Traffic is also one of the main problems in large cities. The development of intelligent transportation systems may contribute to the solution of both problems. Autonomous vehicles have been addressed by the academic community for decades and recently have been obtaining a considerable attention from the industry. One of the next steps for such technology is the development of communication systems that allow cooperative driving, which could improve the traffic efficiency. This paper proposes a simulation framework for the development of cooperative driving systems. Our framework is capable of accurate simulation of vehicles, sensors, complex environments, and wireless communication between vehicles.

More precisely, we run prediction algorithms on the central server to obtain future state for the subset of the links in the network that we refer to as compressed network state. Then, we send the predicted values for compressed network state to smartphones where network extrapolation is performed. Network extrapolation involves vector-matrix multiplication where row vector represents the compressed network state while the matrix is stored on the mobile phone and contains the relationships function between the compressed state and entire network.

In most transportation studies, traffic parameters are typically modeled as time series. However, these techniques fail to incorporate the spatial dependencies between different traffic variables. In this work, the traffic quantities such as speeds are considered as the signals defined at the vertices of a network line graph. Furthermore, the graph wavelet operators are applied to the spatial signals to generate the wavelet coefficients at different wavelet scales. By analyzing these wavelet coefficients, useful information such as origin, propagation, and the span of traffic congestion are inferred. For analysis, we consider two major expressways in Singapore. The analysis shows that the abrupt changes in the speed can be captured by using the wavelet coefficients at the higher scales. On the other hand, the high magnitude coefficients at the lower wavelet scales reflect the smooth flow of the traffic across the network.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957939","","Roads;Fourier transforms;Laplace equations;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet coefficients","data acquisition;data mining;graph theory;intelligent transportation systems;network theory (graphs);time series;wavelet transforms","intelligent transport systems;data-mining techniques;traffic pattern extraction;disruptive traffic event detection;transportation studies;traffic parameters;time series;traffic quantities;network line graph;graph wavelet operators;spatial signals;wavelet coefficients;traffic congestion;Singapore;expressways;traffic data acquisition","","7","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, little is known about the industry. To advance understanding of this system, minibus taxis were equipped with tracking devices in this study. Tracking data was then used to develop a model that describes the transport network - essentially finding patterns in the apparent chaos for the potential benefit of its users. The adaptive model uses unsupervised learning to predict the informal stages in the city and provide travelers with intelligence on the best time and place to get transport, thereby reducing the waiting time at the taxi rank and the informal roadside stops.

Public transportation is efficient, cheaper and has lower energy/carbon footprint, but has a last-mile problem (access) and low spatio-temporal coverage in suburbia. We envisage a future model of leasing public transportation via a service similar to cell-phone services, where the user pays for convenience and sharing of a network.

In the macro level, however, it is more important to understand overall effects of environment features on driver behavior, and their combined effects on driving safety. Based on some previous findings on the significant effects of driver glance behavior on crash risk and the prominent moderating effects of traffic density levels on this relationship, this paper tries to use surrounding vehicle patterns to classify traffic density levels and study the direct effects of traffic density levels on driver glance behavior. The datasets used for analysis are based on VTTI 100-car study. After proposing the measures of surrounding vehicle patterns, the classification of traffic density is completed using support vector machine (SVM). The results show that, although it is difficult to classify four traffic density levels based on the proposed surrounding vehicle patterns, the predication accuracy for two or three traffic density levels is good.

Among these systems, pedestrian crash imminent braking systems are towards pedestrian safety and are able to predict potential crash/near-crash events associated with pedestrians and vehicles, and take appropriate actions to mitigate potential crash effects. In order to evaluate the performance of such systems, we need to design suitable testing scenarios, collect field data on the system performance, and analyze data to see how the systems behave for certain performance indices. Clearly, due to the time and cost of vehicle field testing, it is impossible to test every scenario for performance evaluation. Therefore, a subset of test scenarios, which are critical (i.e., in terms of crashes, fatalities, social cost, etc.) and capture key crash parameters, must be obtained for vehicle testing. In this paper, we propose a methodology that is based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find a subset of testing scenarios from a complete set of testing scenarios (obtained via crash databases), by satisfying given constraints. We show that our GA-based approach is effective and efficient. More specifically, it can find the approximated optimal testing scenarios in a much faster time than exhaustive search method.

A stochastic consistent network with STD link travel times was built. The methodology of robust optimization was applied to evaluate the paths for a priori optimization without requiring the probability distribution of travel times. The paths with greatest robustness, namely minimum upper bounds of travel times were defined as the optimal path. Under the stochastic consistent condition, the STD robust optimal path model can be converted into solving a time-dependent shortest path problem in a FIFO network.

In that context, new ITS paradigms like Cooperative Systems (C-ITS) enable an efficient traffic state estimation and traffic control. C-ITS refers to three levels of cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure: (i) equipped vehicles with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) adjusting their motion to surrounding traffic conditions; (ii) information exchange with the infrastructure; (iii) vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Therefore, C-ITS make it possible to go a step further in providing real time information and tailored control strategies to specific drivers. As a response to an expected increasing penetration rate of these systems, traffic managers and researchers have to come up with new methodologies that override the classical methods of traffic modelling and traffic control. We focus in this paper on the potentialities of C-ITS for traffic management with the methodological issues following the expansion of such systems. The methods for introducing a cooperative modelling framework within existing traffic models are discussed. The paper also provides a building block for Cooperative Traffic Management (CTM).

These mannequins represent relevant physical properties of human beings that are used by most common PCS sensors in vehicles for pedestrian detection. Three different mannequin sizes were generated to represent child, fit adult and obese adult of U.S. pedestrians. These sizes were generated using a K-means clustering method with crash weighted NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data. To ensure that the mannequin provides the same radar cross section (RCS) as a pedestrian in the view of a 77GHz automotive radar, a special mannequin skin was developed. To make the mannequin move like a real human in the view of PCS cameras, mannequins were configured with 6 degrees of freedom articulation, 2 for shoulders, 2 for hips, and 2 for knees. The mannequin limbs are detachable at crash in order to protect the mannequin motion driving system. To ensure that the mannequins move like a real human, a gait planning method was adopted to generate different walking speed based on the gaiting research in medical fields. Other mannequin features are to support various test setups, low weight for test vehicle safety, and crash forgivingness. The mannequins were used in hundreds of PCS test runs at different crash angles and vehicle speeds.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957926","Mannequin;Pedestrian;PCS (Pre-Collision System);PCAM (Pedestrian crash avoidance/mitigation);K-means;RCS (Radar Cross Section)","Skin;Radar cross-sections;Vehicles;Safety;Legged locomotion;Sensors","gait analysis;image sensors;impact testing;pattern clustering;pedestrians;road accidents;road safety;road vehicle radar;traffic engineering computing","mannequin development;pedestrian precollision system evaluation;active pedestrian safety equipment;pedestrian fatalities;vehicle manufactures;PCS sensors;pedestrian detection;child;fit adult;obese adult;US pedestrians;K-means clustering method;crash weighted NHANES data;national health and nutrition examination survey;radar cross section;automotive radar;PCS cameras;mannequin limbs;mannequin motion driving system;gait planning method;walking speed;gaiting research;medical fields;test setups;test vehicle safety;crash forgivingness;crash angles;vehicle speeds","","6","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An algorithm for estimating collisions in real-time using fused measurements of a video camera, a laser range finder (LRF), and ego vehicle motion sensors is presented. The threat posed by the actual driving situation is assessed by calculating a certain risk value, which is determined by combining the collision probability and crash severity estimations in a comprehensive way. A scale model vehicle is introduced to capture characteristics of the proposed system experimentally. First test runs show that the object width measurement is very accurate (absolute error of 5%) and the maximum time to collision (TTC) estimation error is around 17% about 300ms before the impact.

This paper presents an information system architecture, the so-called Mobility Broker, a joint platform for mobility services that enables provider collaboration to offer travelers the best possible combined service. Mobility Broker combines heterogeneous mobility service data, like time tables and car sharing places, using standardized open interfaces and well-known methods of data integration. The combined information allows intermodal routing for generating combined itineraries. Furthermore, it allows to use one ticket for heterogenous travelings. By this simplification of access to intermodal travel, we aim to foster the integration of alternative public transport modes.

It can also support real-time weather-responsive traffic management (WRTM) by quickly classifying a current or predicted weather condition into pre-defined categories and suggesting relevant WRTM strategies that can be tested via real-time traffic simulation before deployment. A detailed method for clustering weather time series data is presented and demonstrated using historical data. Two clustering algorithms with different similarity measures are compared. Clustering results using a K-means clustering algorithm with squared Euclidean distance are illustrated in an application to travel time reliability.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957787","K-means Clustering;Hierarchical Clustering;Similarity Measures;Traffic Simulation;Scenarios-based Approach;Travel Time Reliability Analysis","Reliability;Snow;Rain;Indexes;Time series analysis;Euclidean distance","data mining;data warehouses;decision support systems;pattern clustering;real-time systems;reliability;traffic engineering computing;transportation","pattern recognition;scenario definition;traffic simulation-based decision support systems;data warehouses;data mining;transportation projects;travel time reliability analysis;traffic estimation;prediction systems;real-time weather-responsive traffic management;WRTM;real-time traffic simulation;K-means clustering;squared Euclidean distance","","3","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of the study was such that the scenarios induced certain emotions in the participants and those emotions were measured using psychological emotion surveys. The base scenario allowed the participants to interact without any pressure being applied to them. The anxiety scenario applied pressure to the participants through a time limit and police vehicles patrolling the roadway. The anger scenario applied pressure to the participants through aggressive actions by the surrounding traffic. The findings showed that emotions caused drivers to change the distribution of their driving behaviors.

Generally, the rear-end collision avoidance system detects risk situation based on the information collected by radar or camera. When the following car is in risk of crash, the system will inform or warn the driver that the current speed is not safe, and help drivers to decelerate or brake. With the development of vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), a new way to develop the rear-end collision avoidance system is put forward. By using the connected vehicles, the system can collect information and share message through the communicate equipment.

However, prediction of driving behaviors is also difficult issue, because the distribution of each driving behavior seems to be not unimodal but multimodal due to its intrinsic complexity and lack of a well-established segmentation method. When we consider to predict driving behaviors with a supervised dimension reduction method and hidden Markov models (HMMs), the multimodal structure of observed distributions should be preserved since they can contain information regarding these behaviors. We therefore propose to combine HMMs with local Fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA) that can maximize the between-class separatability and preserve within-class multimodality. We evaluated the performance of the HMMs with LFDA in predicting actual driving behaviors, and compared its performance with those of with conventional Fisher discriminant analysis and with no dimension reduction.

And it turns out that business and leisure tourists are both most sensitive to travel plan, but factors significantly affecting leisure tourist are more dispersive, including expense, plan and information of attractions.

Moving vehicles are detected against a background estimated using a self-adaptive Gaussian mixture model (SAGMM), and fitted by a simple wireframe model. The vehicle is tracked by a Kalman filter using a landmark feature that is close to the road surface. The centre line of each traffic lane is computed by clustering many trajectories.

Currently, boosting a set of local features based on histogram of oriented gradients (HOGs) to form a pedestrian detector has proven its effectiveness in the literature. However, this kind of approaches suffer from the problem of false detection in case of complex background or noise effect. Accordingly, the main objective of this work is to alleviate this problem by integrating the results from the template matching, which is a kind of global features into the boosting framework. The idea behind is to adjust the hyperplane of the support vector machine according to the template-based classifier at each round of boosting stage. This makes both global and local features complement each other and the learned detector raises the detection rate and reduces the false positive rate at the same time. Instead of manual annotation, a set of representative templates are automatically constructed based on expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.

However, it can not guarantee that the vehicle could arrive at the intersection with the allowed maximum velocity. Therefore, in this paper, the augmented lagrangian genetic algorithm (ALGA) is proposed for searching the optimized speed curve in all possible speed curves, according to the minimal fuel consumption and the minimal running time, moreover the car following model is employed for handling the multi-vehicles problem.

The CIB simulation can be based on the component sensor parameters and decision making rules. Since these parameters and decision rules for on the market vehicles are not available outside of vehicle manufactures, it is difficult for the general research communities to develop a good CIB simulation model based on this approach. To solve this problem, this study presents a new method for developing a pedestrian CIB simulation model using pedestrian CIB testing data. The implementation was in PreScan.

It is based on an image superpixel segmentation coupled with graph cuts binary clustering, initialized by a state-of-the-art foreground detection method. The proposed strategy is composed of four blocks. A pre-processing block that uses filters and colorimetric invariants to limit the presence of artifacts in images. A foreground detection block that enables to locate moving people in images. A post-treatment block that removes shadow regions of no-interest. A people extraction block that segments the image into SLIC superpixels and performs a graph cut binary clustering to precisely extract people. Tests are realized on a real database of the BOSS European project and are evaluated with the standard F-measure criteria.

In particular, these GCRs deliberately revise the MAC protocol parameters and adopt Small Backoff Window (SBW) attack to gain the high priority of spectrum usage. In this paper, we propose a proactive protection scheme in Distributed Cognitive Radio Networks (DSRNs) to constrain this unfair competition, while guarantee the fairness and Quality of Service (QoS) of independent NSUs' transmission. In the proposed scheme, GCRs with high priority are allowed to access spectrum resource, while satisfying two prior rules: Rule 1, GCRs are required to prolong the transmission time of each packet in exchange for the high priority on spectrum usage; Rule 2, GCRs allow NSUs to transmit data with themselves simultaneously in certain slots.

Based on the Beijing Subway data, the usage patterns of the URT network were comprehensively analyzed under the scenarios of shortest path (SP) routing and minimum cost (MC) routing. We found that MC routing can considerably reduce congestion in the URT network with a tiny increase of travel time. Interestingly, encouraging a small fraction of passengers who experience the most congestion to adopt MC routing achieves nearly the same effect with pure MC routing on mitigating congestion. Hence, a hybrid routing model was proposed to offer practical solutions for alleviating passenger congestion in the URT networks.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957691","","Routing;Rails;Graphical models;Distribution functions;Time measurement;Roads","railways;vehicle routing","urban rail transit networks;transportation systems;optimal transporting efficiency;congestion avoidance routing model;URT network;shortest path routing;SP;minimum cost routing;MC;travel time;passenger congestion","","4","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The novel aspect of the presented work is the tightly coupling of context information and the particle filtering process.

This approach is evaluated on objects (tracklets) from the public KITTI benchmark database.

This paper is particularly concerned with how to quantitatively assess the vulnerability of a network system by taking into account indirect impact of spatially local hazards. To this end, this paper firstly defines a neutral line and impact curve. Then, based on neutral line and impact curve, two novel spatial vulnerability indexes are proposed: absolute spatial vulnerability index (ASVI) and relative spatial vulnerability index (RSVI). Both ASVI and RSVI can effectively indicate to what extent a network system is vulnerable/neutral/robust to spatially local hazards. The proposed spatial vulnerability indexes are then particularly applied to study the civil aviation network system in China, and the simulation results show that (i) the new concept is correct and useful, and (ii) the Chinese civil aviation network system is vulnerable to spatially local hazards when indirect impact is considered.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958114","Spatial Vulnerability;Civil Aviation;Hazard;Network;Risk","Hazards;Airports;Robustness;Graphical models;Distribution functions;Indexes;Educational institutions","air traffic;transportation","spatial vulnerability index;civil aviation network system;China;transportation systems;neutral line;impact curve;absolute spatial vulnerability index;ASVI index;relative spatial vulnerability index;RSVI index","","3","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Empirical findings show that if drivers would follow the recommended optimal policy, then an energy saving of up to 50 % is a realistic upper bound potential.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957760","","Optimized production technology;Energy consumption;Simulated annealing;Vehicles;Convergence","behavioural sciences computing;driver information systems;economics;energy consumption;rail traffic;simulated annealing;transportation","optimal policies;energy-efficient train driving;transportation;cog-wheel;economies;modern lifestyles;energy production;energy consumption;automobiles;offline driver behavior adaptation approach;simulated annealing","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Commercial trains are equipped with state-of-the-art onboard intelligent sensors monitoring various subsystems all over the train such as tilt, traction, signalling, pantograph, doors, etc. These sensors provide real-time flow of data, called floating train data, consisting of georeferenced events, along with their spatial and temporal coordinates. Once ordered with respect to time, these events can be considered as long temporal sequences which can be mined for valuable information. The aim is to implement these information into an on-line analysis process of the incoming event stream in order to predict the occurrence of infrequent target events, i.e. severe failures requiring immediate corrective maintenance actions. In this article, we tackle the above mentioned data mining task. We propose a methodology based on pattern recognition methods in order to predict rare tilt and traction failures in sequences using past events that are less critical.

In this paper we demonstrate that an efficiently designed overload control system that utilizes modern information and communication technologies can simultaneously achieve the objectives of improved accuracy of control and increased logistics efficiency. The key element that makes this possible is the real-time sharing of information between different overload control centers, combined with the intelligent interpretation of available data, in order to optimize overload control over the entire corridor.

However, further reduction is needed, especially on residential roads, where the reduction rate of traffic accidents is still quite small. On residential roads, traffic accidents are caused primarily by pedestrians suddenly running in front of cars and by the inattention of drivers to such risks. Automatic emergency braking systems activated by pedestrian detection are not always reliable on residential roads due to physical limitations such as too short a braking distance. To overcome the limitations of current active safety management systems, we focus on risk anticipation and defensive driving, key ideas to ensure safety on residential roads. Since defensive driving requires careful deceleration in advance of barrier lines and the corners of streets, long-term driver behavior prediction is needed. In this work, we provide a new framework of modeling risk anticipation and defensive driving with inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). In contrast to conventional driver behavior models such as hidden Markov models and maximum-entropy Markov models, our framework using IRL ensures accurate long-term prediction of driver maneuvers since the IRL is based on the Markov decision process (MDP), a goal-oriented path planning framework. Because the predicted defensive driver behaviors obtained by an MDP are appropriate only when the reward functions are carefully designed, we use inverse reinforcement learning, where the normative behavior of expert drivers is leveraged to optimize the reward functions. In addition to the proposed formulation of defensive driving with IRL, we provide new feature descriptors for computing reward functions to represent risk factors on residential roads such as corners, barrier lines, and speed limitations. Experimental results using actual driver maneuver data over 20 km of residential roads indicate that our approach is successful in terms of providing precise learning models of risk anticipation and defensive driving. We also found that the behavior models obtained by expert/inexperienced drivers are helpful for determining the factors in risk anticipation and defensive driving.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957937","","Vehicles;Roads;Hidden Markov models;Data models;Acceleration;Feature extraction;Safety","braking;decision theory;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;path planning;pedestrians;risk management;road safety","risk anticipation modeling;defensive driving;residential roads;inverse reinforcement learning;active safety systems;ITS community;traffic accident reduction;automatic emergency braking systems;pedestrian detection;active safety management systems;long-term driver behavior prediction;Markov decision process;MDP;goal-oriented path planning framework;reward functions;feature descriptors","","8","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, we compared the estimation accuracy in different segments, passing taxi number and collected points.

Existing road marking detectors that analyzes reflective intensity data focus only on lane markings and ignores other types of signalization. We propose a road marking detector based on Otsu thresholding method that make possible segment LIDAR point clouds into asphalt and road marking.

The latter, even though fair for the vehicles of the same Origin-Destination (O-D) pair, in general can be arbitrarily more costly than the system optimum. System optimization, on the other hand, can produce unfair assignments both for the vehicles of the same as of different O-D pairs. To surmount the performance issue of the user- in respect to the system-optimization while considering the fairness issues, we propose a MAS-based distributed optimization model for path assignment to vehicles from the same and different OD pairs at two levels. On the upper level, the proposed model optimizes the overall O-D pairs' Nash Welfare with the fairness related constraints while on the lower level, for every O-D pair separately, paths are assigned to individual vehicles through the auction algorithm. We test the solution approach through simulation, compare it with the conventional user- and system-optimization, and thus demonstrate that it results in fair and globally efficient path-vehicle assignments.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957885","","Vehicles;Optimization;Roads;Resource management;Real-time systems;Routing;Vectors","optimisation;transportation","fair route guidance;bridging system;user optimization;real-time road network information;Wardrop equilibrium;origin-destination pair;system optimization;O-D pairs;MAS-based distributed optimization model;path assignment;auction algorithm;path-vehicle assignments","","3","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Taiwan, the prevention of motorcycle accidents cannot be ignored when developing safety DASs since they are involved in a significant percentage of traffic accidents. This paper proposes a safety DAS for motorcycles which can obtain an input sequence from a smartphone, detect the distance between the owner's motorcycle and an obstacle ahead, and output warning messages if necessary.The study is divided into two parts. Firstly, transformation matrices of different camera angles are calculated and stored in a transformation matrix database. Secondly, a kernel system is developed. The system can turn each input frame into a top-view image using a suitable transformation matrix from the database. Further, the system can detect obstacles in the top view image and calculate the distance between the owner's motorcycle and the obstacles. Concurrently, the GPS embedded in the smartphone can be used to obtain the speed of the motorcycle in order to calculate the safe distance. Finally, the system gives the rider suitable warning messages after comparing these two distances. The experimental results show that the proposed real-time system is robust and efficient. Moreover, the system is also suitable for deployment in cars.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957712","","Motorcycles;Safety;Cameras;Accidents;Transforms;Image edge detection;Databases","accident prevention;cameras;computer vision;driver information systems;Global Positioning System;matrix algebra;motorcycles;object detection;road accidents;road safety;road traffic;smart phones","vision-based safety driver assistance system for motorcycles;smartphone;car companies;Taiwan;motorcycle accident prevention;traffic accident prevention;safety DAS;output warning messages;camera angles;transformation matrix database;kernel system;real-time system","","4","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a sensor fusion based vehicle detection approach by fusing information from both LiDAR and cameras. The proposed approach is based on two components: a hypothesis generation phase to generate positions that potential represent vehicles and a hypothesis verification phase to classify the corresponding objects. Hypothesis generation is achieved using the stereo camera while verification is achieved using the LiDAR. The main contribution is that the complementary advantages of two sensors are utilized, with the goal of vehicle detection.

This applies to all levels of functions ranging from simple advices and warning functions right down to the evaluation of possible behavior alternatives, planning and autonomous driving. Current risk handling includes probabilistic collision measures, behavior planning using spatial and temporal occupancy grids, and time metrics such as Time-To-X (e.g. TTC, Time-To-Collision). Especially TTX measures are often used to quantify the threat of a future event. In this paper, we develop a theory of the probability of critical future events such as collisions. We show that by introducing the concept of a “survival probability”, we can derive previously heuristic risk measures like TTX, generalize them to temporally continuous risk indicator functions and apply them to several different situations such as e.g. collision risk, risk of passing nearby without collision, risk at intersection entrance or risk in narrow curves. We show how the TTC-based risk can be described as a special case of a general distance-based risk, with the Time-To-Closest-Encounter (TTCE) and the Distance-of-Closest-Encounter (DCE) as modulating parameters. Furthermore, the introduced risk measures can be used for planning under general conditions, e.g. using “risk maps” to evaluate behavior options according to their risk.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957773","","Estimation;Accidents;Predictive models;Probability;Probabilistic logic;Vehicles;Planning","driver information systems;probability;risk analysis;road traffic","predictive risk estimation;intelligent ADAS functions;advanced driver assistance system;warning functions;probabilistic collision measures;behavior planning;spatial occupancy grids;temporal occupancy grids;time metrics;time-to-closest-encounter;TTCE;distance-of-closest-encounter;DCE","","15","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

LP takes the advantages of simplicity in modelling, efficiency in computation, flexibility in applications. Compared with the previously proposed model in [1], the proposed LP optimisation model takes into account the speed limit constraints during the braking operation. Four case studies have been performed with different speed limits and initial braking speeds. While the maximum allowed braking time takes a key role for the RBE recovery, a threshold exists when the impact of maximum allowed braking time starts to become negligible. It has been demonstrated in this paper that LP is a robust and effective method to locate the optimal braking trajectory with the maximum RBE. The results of the optimisation are of significant interest for urban transportation systems where the regenerative braking is frequently applied. Future work of this paper is to investigate the optimisation of RBE in a more complicated scenario where the gradients are present and the motoring operation of train is allowed.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958090","","Trajectory;Optimization;Rail transportation;Mathematical model;Linear programming;Rails;Educational institutions","braking;linear programming;rail traffic control;regenerative braking;trajectory control;velocity control","maximum regenerative braking energy;linear programming;railway transportation;kinetic energy;electrical energy;energy conversion;train braking trajectory;LP optimisation model;speed limit constraints;braking operation;braking trajectory;urban transportation systems;train motoring operation","","6","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such objects provide important information for driving safety. But it is challenging to reliably detect and recognize them by using camera in complex environments. One of the main challenges comes from the perspective distortion. Substantial algorithms have been proposed to address this problem for specific planar objects by taking advantage of the characteristics of the problems at hand. In contrast to those target-specific algorithms, we propose a generic algorithm to rectify the perspective distortion of planar objects based on the data fusion of LIDAR and camera. The main idea of our algorithm is to use LIDAR data to recover the 3D geometric model of a planar object, and then pose a virtual camera to look orthogonally toward it. This virtual camera is capable of generating the desired fronto-parallel view of the planar target. Meanwhile, the rectifying homography between the virtual and real cameras only relies on the plane parameters and the relative pose between both cameras, irrespective of the category of the planar object. This enables our algorithm can be applied to various planar objects with arbitrary shapes. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient to correct the perspective distortion of common planar objects in traffic scenarios.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957703","","Roads;Cameras;Heuristic algorithms;Laser radar;Shape;Robustness;Optical distortion","object detection;optical radar;sensor fusion;traffic engineering computing;video cameras","rectifying homography;virtual camera;3D geometric model;generic algorithm;target-specific algorithms;street sign;traffic sign;road surface;camera data fusion;LIDAR data fusion;planar object;perspective distortion rectification","","4","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a robust curve lane detection method based on Improved River Flow (IRF) and RANSAC method is proposed to detect curve lane under challenging conditions. The lane markings are grouped into a near vision field of straight line and a far vision field of curve line. The curve lanes are based on Hyperbola-pair model. To determine the coefficient of curvature, a novel method is proposed based on Improved River Flow method and RANSAC method. In the new method, Improved River Flow method is employed to search feature points in the far vision field guided by the results of detected straight lines in near vision field or the curve lines from last frame, which can connect dashed lane markings or obscured lane markings. So, it is robust on dashed lane markings and vehicle occlusion. Then, RANSAC is utilized to calculate the curvature, which can eliminate noisy feature points obtained from Improved River Flow.

This includes an associative and predictive situation model which combines probabilistic object hypotheses with a stochastic model of the road network in a curve coordinate system. Utilizing this description, we formulate various hypotheses regarding the evolvement of the situation using an Extended Kalman Filter supported by the Intelligent Driver Model. Furthermore, we introduce an evidence theory based situation interpretation to assess the several behavior hypotheses as well as to determine the inherent uncertainty. Especially in ambiguous situations, the ability to determine the imprecision by the difference of belief and plausibility of a certain hypothesis provides suitable information for an appropriate reaction. Both layers of the proposed situation analysis are not relying on training data and so it is not limited to previous known traffic scenarios.

A weighted spatial pyramid framework is introduced to extract feature vectors from these ROIs. In this framework, we consider the union of ROIs instead of processing the ROIs individually for robustness and efficiency. Dense SIFT descriptors are extracted from the ROIs for robust description of the image. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors are weighted based on the corresponding ROIs, highlighting locations with high confidence. The spatial pyramid scheme is then implemented to exploit the spatial distribution of local features. Finally, we apply a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify the logos based on max pooling of local descriptors.

Here, we develop a probabilistic model and inference procedure for estimating the set of valid connections between lanes entering and exiting an intersection. The input to our algorithm is a set of vehicle tracks derived from Lidar data on an experimental vehicle. These tracks are both positionally noisy and often do not fully traverse the intersection due to loss of tracking for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, there is significant ambiguity in data association between the tracked vehicles and possible intersection structures.

To deal with this problem, the proposed method performs segmentation of an image for every haze color and estimates the airlight, the transmission, and the weight of dehaze in each segmentation area individually. Most of haze removal algorithms require a tone curve correction as post processing. However, it is very difficult to select an optimal tone curve correction for any image. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel algorithm that does not require any tone curve correction. The general haze removal algorithm treats only haze image. However, in the field of outdoor camera surveillance, it's desirable to realize the algorithm which can be applied to various weather conditions.

One such challenge is related to the accurate detection of traffic incidents in urban networks for more efficient traffic management. This paper introduces a classification approach that achieves accurate detection of road traffic incidents, based on data retrieved from inductive-loop detectors. In the core of the proposed approach lies a more efficient feature extraction technique, based on the dynamic characteristics of data corresponding to those vehicles that are involved in incidents. Our work observes how dynamic aspects of measured data can be exploited for extracting features that result in measurable improvement of the incident detection rate by the application of a Support Vector Machines classification approach. The latter is known to be one of the most precise solutions that have been widely applied up to now for dealing with relevant incident detection problems. In this paper we conduct appropriate experimental evaluation, including comparison to a set of well known techniques, for assessing the impact of the proposed feature selection technique on the accuracy of the detection rate. The evaluation results show that our approach manages to realize a more accurate and faster incident detection mechanism, although it has a low impact on the improvement of the false alarm rate. We also describe how the proposed approach can be applied to a generic context of ITS for efficient urban traffic management.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957808","","Roads;Support vector machines;Artificial intelligence;Measurement;Detectors;Vehicles;Feature extraction","data mining;feature extraction;feature selection;intelligent transportation systems;pattern classification;road traffic;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing","traffic data mining;road incidents detection;urban road congestion;ITS technologies;urban networks;road traffic incident detection;inductive-loop detectors;feature extraction technique;dynamic characteristics;incident detection rate;support vector machines classification approach;feature selection technique;urban traffic management","","1","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is especially true when it relates to disorders found within the human musculoskeletal system. Although clinical pain research is confounded by many complex factors, it is possible to overcome such obstacles by promoting a multidisciplinary and holistic approach that integrates traditional oriental techniques with Western medicine and science. As an assessment of such an integrated approach, this paper aims to realize a computerized visual-graphic representation of a therapist-guided technique called the Somatic Balance Restoration Therapy (SBRT). The SBRT is a simple but effective self-exercise therapy, with initial assistance from a trained instructor/therapist. This guidance is necessary for optimal safety and effective execution of the therapy's painless exercise motions. Based on therapy records of over ten thousand cases, one of the authors has established a systematic approach in identifying and diagnosing distortions/malfunctions, while the other author has developed a visualization algorithm of the SBRT.

Coarse gaze direction is often sufficient in a number of applications, however, the challenge is to estimate gaze direction robustly in naturalistic real-world driving. Towards this end, we propose gaze-surrogate features estimated from eye region via eyelid and iris analysis. We present a novel iris detection computational framework. We are able to extract proposed features robustly and determine driver's gaze zone effectively. We evaluated the proposed system on a dataset, collected from naturalistic on-road driving in urban streets and freeways. A human expert annotated driver's gaze zone ground truth using information from the driver's eyes and the surrounding context. We conducted two experiments to compare the performance of the gaze zone estimation with and without eye cues. The head-alone experiment has a reasonably good result for most of the gaze zones with an overall 79.8% of weighted accuracy. By adding eye cues, the experimental result shows that the overall weighted accuracy is boosted to 94.9%, and all the individual gaze zones have a better true detection rate especially between the adjacent zones. Therefore, our experimental evaluations show efficacy of the proposed features and very promising results for robust gaze zone estimation.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957817","","Vehicles;Iris;Head;Iris recognition;Estimation;Robustness;Cameras","driver information systems;estimation theory;gaze tracking","gaze zone estimation;driver gaze direction;head cue;eye cue;iris analysis;on-road driving","","25","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous work on energy optimization techniques mainly focuses on optimizing driving strategies subject to geographic and physical constraints, and kinematic equations, which only minimizes the mechanical energy consumption without considering the loss from the power supply network. This paper proposes a DC power network modeling technique and extends the traditional energy-saving methods to develop a novel approach which combines traction power supply network calculations and numerical algorithms to minimize the electrical energy delivered from substations. As train resistance is time-varying with the train movement, iterative algorithms are presented in order to calculate the energy consumption dynamically.

The objective of this paper is to provide a methodology for modeling incidents in microscopic traffic simulation environment. Queue lengths and shockwave propagation speeds resulting from incidents obtained from analytical kinematic wave theory (Lighthill - Witham - Richard or LWR) were used to calibrate incident model in microscopic traffic simulation (VISSIM). A two lane freeway along the HRBT corridor was taken as a test bed. Fundamental diagram corresponding to the corridor was developed using Van-Aerde traffic mode and was used as an input to LWR. Queue length as a result of incidents blocking only one lane and both lanes were analyzed. Reduction in capacity, as suggested in HCM, was considered in the process of incident model calibration. The results suggest that a well calibrated incident model in VISSIM is capable of reproducing the queue lengths and shockwaves obtained from LWR and thus can be used for understanding the impact of incidents on freeways and testing alternative traffic management strategies, e.g., minimize delay or emissions.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958199","","Mathematical model;Microscopy;Analytical models;Vehicles;Equations;Queueing analysis","queueing theory;road traffic","microscopic simulation calibration;traffic flow modeling;microscopic traffic simulation environment;queue lengths;shockwave propagation speeds;analytical kinematic wave theory;microscopic traffic simulation;two lane freeway;HRBT corridor;Van-Aerde traffic mode;LWR;HCM;incident model calibration;VISSIM;alternative traffic management strategies","","2","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Strengthening harmonization of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) silos in IT environment through systems approach","S. W. Hussaini","Business Systems and Cybernetics Center, Tata Consultancy Services, Hyderabad, India","17th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","","2014","","","178","183","This paper presents a model based on cybernetics and systems thinking principles to overcome the challenges of strengthening the harmonization of Development and Operations functions in an enterprise. This was as a result of the challenges faced in applying industry standard tools/frameworks to complex problem. DevOps is an acronym for Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) of information technology (IT) systems and applications. DevOps paradigm emerged as a response to the growing knowledge that there exists a gap of 4Cs (communications, co-operation, culture and collaboration) between what is usually considered IT development function and what is generally considered IT operations function of an organization. This gap often widens and manifests itself in many forms such as adverse competition, team conflict, inordinate delays and inefficiency of business applications/IT systems. There is a “Wall of Confusion” between IT development and operations as stated by Andrew Shafer and Lee Thompson. This “Wall” is caused by a combination of conflicting motivations among people, processes, and technology/tooling. Hence there is a pressing need for strengthening the harmonization of Development and Operations functions of an IT organization. IT Development (including testing and assurance services) professionals often tend to come with an outlook where change is the thing that they are mandated to accomplish. The business folks depend on them to respond to fast changing business and/or technology needs. Because of this intimate relationship, Dev are often expected to bring in as much change as possible. IT Operations folks tend to come with an outlook where change is the enemy. The business folks depend on them to keep the lights on and deliver the services that make the business money today. Operations folks tend to resist change as it undermines stability and reliability of IT systems/applications. Many times we heard that lion's share of all downtime is due to those self-inflicted injuries known as changes? To make matters worse and things more political and complex, development and operations teams generally position into different parts of a company's organizational structure (often with different General Managers and competing corporate politics) and often work at different geographic locations. According to a Gartner report[1], ""Through 2010, Gartner expects that most IT organizations will continue to focus on the basic IT processes of application development, project management and service management. They will fail toextend this process focus to all activities, and will fail to change organizational values and behaviors."". There was a pressing need to dive deep in to this complex problem with a systems thinking approach. “The model leveraged here is called SNACTM. This stands for Stakeholders, Needs, Alterables and Constraints. This model is used to increase variety in the system in focus. Stakeholders are identified in categories like internal and external to the program. This involves identifying all stakeholders in the program, their needs, interests and influences. The Stakeholders, their needs, constraints and the alterables that are introduced to overcome the constraints are identified and considered. Alterables are the things that the organization believes it can alter or change.”[13][15] This model enables to identify key objectives that are common to both Dev and Ops. This also involves identifying key themes of DevOps which form the levers of transformation that is being delivered. The stakeholders, their interests and influences help focus on the key themes of DevOps strategy. This helps the program managers/directors to focus on key themes that need to be in focus to respective stakeholders at right time when they are needed the most during delivery lifecycle. The paper covers an overview, the theoretical basis on which this model has been built. It also covers the model itself in detail. The paper also illustrates a case, which used this concept, conclusion and future direction for the framework. The model was deployed successfully to assess the feasibility and craft DevOps strategy of a large IT program of customer contact transformation for a large telecom company in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region providing telecom services and products to tens of millions of customers. The results of application of the aforementioned systems science model to address the problem are also illustrated.. The outlined model here, helped in the identification of levers to protect DevOps stakeholders interest and enhance effectiveness and efficiency.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957687","DevOps;SNAC™;Transorformation levers;Harmonization","Organizations;Object recognition;Cybernetics;Knowledge management;Pressing;Terminology","DP management","IT environment;information technology;systems approach;cybernetics principle;systems thinking principle;DevOps paradigm;IT development function;IT operation function;IT organization;4C knowledge;communications-cooperation-culture-collaboration knowledge;IT development;SNACTM model;stakeholders-needs-alterables-constraints model;IT program;customer contact transformation","","1","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to contribute to the formulation of human centric driving assistive / active safety systems, it is also imperative to understand the human component along with vehicle dynamics. Using massive corpora of on-road real-traffic naturalistic driving data exported from CAN-Bus signals, it is possible to develop maneuver recognition for continuous driving performance evaluation. Although high accuracy of automatic maneuver recognition could be obtained using statistic methods such as Hidden Markov Models and/or Bayesian Statistics, this comes at great costs in computational complexity which can jeopardize the viability of applying such driving assistance in real-time embedded systems. To save computational resources, this study proposes to set up an easier threshold based decision-tree strategy. The method is based on filterbank analysis of time-frequency spectrogram processing of steering wheel angle and vehicle speed signals. It is shown that threshold selection is critical to ensure that specific maneuvers with higher levels of danger receive higher recognition accuracy. Analysis of the proposed maneuver recognition system is performed using data from the UTDrive vehicle corpus, with a 6-way decision-tree maneuver performance ranging from 54-73% depending on the specific maneuver class. It is suggested that lower performing specific maneuvers could subsequently be enhanced with statistical model based methods afterwards for both embedded in-vehicle systems and tagging of massive data sets.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958144","","Vehicles;Spectrogram;Filter banks;Time-frequency analysis;Roads;Manuals;Accuracy","Bayes methods;controller area networks;decision trees;field buses;hidden Markov models;road safety;signal processing;traffic engineering computing","threshold based decision-tree;automatic driving maneuver recognition;CAN-Bus signal;automatic signal processing;human centric driving assistive system;active safety system;vehicle dynamics;statistic method;hidden Markov model;Bayesian statistics;filterbank analysis;time-frequency spectrogram;steering wheel angle;vehicle speed signal;threshold selection;UTDrive vehicle corpus","","3","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article propose a novel formulation for the construction projects scheduling problem using bi-level programming. A solution method is then introduced to solve this challenging scheduling problem with a focus on reducing the number of calculations in the optimization. This is achieved by integrating expert knowledge, which can be used to characterize a good schedule, in the algorithmic framework in charge of determining a near-optimal schedule. Such heuristic information can come from relevant experts or practitioners, or from the literature in this field. A solution algorithm named CoANT based on ant colony optimization is presented and implemented on realistic transportation networks. Our results show that CoANT works fast and is able to provide competitive schedules.

ALINEA uses real-time occupancy measurements from the ramp flow merging area that may be at most few hundred meters downstream of the metered on-ramp nose. In many practical cases, however, bottlenecks with smaller capacity than the merging area may exist further downstream for various reasons, which suggests using measurements from those further downstream bottlenecks. Recent theoretical and simulation studies indicate that ALINEA may lead to a poorly damped closed-loop behavior in this case, but PI-ALINEA, a suitable Proportional-Integral (PI) extension of ALINEA, can lead to satisfactory control performance. This paper addresses the same local ramp-metering problem in the presence of downstream bottlenecks, with a particular focus on the general capacity of PI-ALINEA with three distinct types of bottleneck that may often be encountered in practice, i.e. (1) an uphill case; (2) a lane-drop case; (3) an un-controlled on-ramp case. Extensive simulation studies are conducted using a macroscopic traffic flow model to demonstrate that the performance of ALINEA indeed deteriorates in each of these bottleneck cases, while significant improvement is obtained using PI-ALINEA in all cases.

However, when cameras are used outdoors they easily get dirty or scratches on the lens which leads to image artifacts that can deteriorate a system's performance. Little work has yet been done on how to detect and cope with such artifacts. Most of the previous work has concentrated on detecting a specific artifact like rain drops on the windshield of a car. In this paper, we show that on moving systems most artifacts can be detected by analyzing the frames in a stream of images from a camera for static image parts. Based on the observation that most artifacts are temporally stable in their position in the image we compute pixel-wise correlations between images. Since the system is moving the static artifacts will lead to a high correlation value while the pixels showing only scene elements will have a low correlation value. For testing this novel algorithm, we recorded some outdoor data with the three different artifacts: raindrops, dirt and scratches. The results of our new algorithm on this data show, that it reliably detects all three artifacts. Moreover, we show that our algorithm can be implemented efficiently by means of box-filters which allows it to be used as a self-checking routine running in background on low-power systems such as autonomous field robots or advanced driver assistant systems on a vehicle.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957756","","Cameras;Glass;Correlation;Robot vision systems;Lenses;Rain","cameras;driver information systems;image processing","camera artifacts;camera images;image artifacts;system performance;car windshield;moving systems;static image parts;pixel-wise correlations;pixels;box-filters;self-checking routine;low power systems;autonomous field robots;advanced driver assistant systems","","4","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, distinguishing pedestrians who are in close proximity is still a big challenge. In this paper, we propose an efficient stereo based ROIs generation method that is based on a two-level incremental segmentation strategy. An adaptive strategy is first employed to identify a minimal set of clusters from the u-disparity image. The initial clusters are then further refined to distinguish pedestrians in close proximity.

In each step of the DMPC approach dispatching actions are determined that reduce the amount of delay in the network as much as possible by solving a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The constraints of the MILP are based on a model of the railway traffic and network and the possible dispatching actions. In the first method each subproblem consists of the complete constraint matrix and the solver tries to minimize the centralized cost function, but can only change a limited number of binary variables (which correspond to the dispatching actions). By limiting the number of binary variables each subproblem is easier to solve than the centralized problem. For the second method each subproblem consists of only a part of the problem and the solver minimizes a local cost function, and it can only change the binary variables for that part of the problem. This reduces the complexity of the subproblems even further, but the solver can not determine the effects of the binary variables on the solution quality of the other subproblems. Both methods significantly reduce the time needed to determine the dispatching actions. The average time needed to compute the solution is 11.56 times shorter when using method 1 and 39.11 times shorter when using method 2. The solution found is on average only 0.63% less optimal for method 1 and 1.27% less optimal for method 2.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958127","","Rail transportation;Dispatching;Delays;Vectors;Predictive models;Cost function;Predictive control","distributed control;integer programming;linear programming;matrix algebra;predictive control;rail traffic control","distributed model predictive control;railway traffic rescheduling;DMPC approach;mixed integer linear programming;dispatching actions;constraint matrix;centralized cost function;binary variables","","2","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the information provided by the perception system, scene analysis has to predict the evolution of the current driving situation for the near future. Thanks to the predicted trajectories of the relevant traffic participants, the risk of collision on the ego vehicle can be calculated. In many cases, a predicted trajectory is not defined with explicit equations but is given as a set of sampled poses, each one corresponding to a different future time instant. A predicted trajectory being always uncertain, confidence has to be estimated on the so predicted poses. We present a method that propagates the known error covariance matrix of the current pose of the ego vehicle by considering local approximations of the predicted trajectory. This allows to estimate the risk of collision of the ego vehicle with a considered target object. The proposed approach uses a Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the probability that the ego vehicle and the object come into collision at a given future time instant. Each sample time of the whole prediction horizon is considered as a potential collision time so that a curve describing the variation of the risk of collision is obtained. This allows the system to have a better comprehension of the scene and to react proportionally to the threat. The overall approach has been tested with simulated data and the consistency of results is shown.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957721","","Trajectory;Vehicles;Covariance matrices;Predictive models;Risk management;Uncertainty;Image analysis","collision avoidance;covariance matrices;driver information systems;Monte Carlo methods;probability;risk management","risk assessment;collision avoidance systems;scene analysis;perception system;traffic participants;ego vehicle;trajectory prediction;pose prediction;error covariance matrix;collision risk estimation;Monte Carlo simulation","","11","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among the root causes of urban traffic congestion, en route events are the main source of the sudden increase of the road traffic load, especially during peak hours. The current solutions, such as on-board navigation systems for individual vehicles, can only provide optimal routes using current traffic data without considering any traffic changes in the future. Those solutions are thus unable to provide a better alternative route quickly enough if an unexpected congestion occurs. Moreover, using the same alternative routes may lead to new bottlenecks that cannot be avoided. Thus a global traffic load balance cannot be achieved. To deal with these problems, we propose a Multi Agent System (MAS) that can achieve a trade-off between the individual and global benefits by giving the vehicles optimal turn suggestions to bypass a blocked road ahead. The simulation results show that our strategy achieves a substantial gain in average trip time reduction under realistic scenarios.

The estimation of the robot's ego lane grows in complexity if crossroads have to be passed. Especially in rural areas, where crossroad locations are more likely to be erroneous, perceiving them in sensor data can prevent improper turn maneuvers. Vice versa the recognition of intersections can be used for localization a given road map. Most of the proposed methods for intersection detection use single sensors like camera or LiDAR. In this paper we show a novel approach for detecting and tracking of rural crossroads by fusing multiple sensors in an accumulated terrain map. Further information for each cell within the terrain map is calculated by extracting the road area and correlating it with different road geometries. In order to detect intersections, we build several hypothetical intersection centers and emit rays from their position. The rays are evaluated according to their cells' information and are bundled to build the branches of intersections. A Sequential Extended Kalman Filter estimates position and geometry of the detected intersections over time. Smart data assignment allows to partially correct single branches of a crossroad as well as to add new branches.

For example, pedestrian protection systems are already available in a number of commercial vehicles. However, there is still work to do in the improvement of the accuracy of these systems since the difference between an effective and a non-effective intervention can depend on a few centimeters or on a fraction of a second. In this paper, we use the 3D pedestrian body language in order to perform accurate pedestrian path prediction by means of action classification. To carry out the prediction, we propose the use of GPDM (Gaussian Process Dynamical Models) that reduces the high dimensionality of the input vector in the 3D pose space and learns the pedestrian dynamics in a latent space. Instead of combining a reduced number of subjects in a single model that will have to deal with the stylistic variations, we propose a much more scalable approach where all the subjects are separately trained in individual models. These models will be then hierarchically separated according to their action (walking, starting, standing, stopping) and direction of the motion. Finally, for a test sequence, the appropiate model will be selected by means of an action classification system based on the similarity of the 3D poses transitions and the joints velocities. The estimated action will constrain the models to use for the prediction, taking into account only the ones trained for that action. Experimental results show that the system has the potential to provide accurate path predictions with mean errors of 7 cm, for walking trajectories, 20 cm, for stopping trajectories and 14 cm for starting trajectories, at a time horizon of 1 s.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957768","","Legged locomotion;Three-dimensional displays;Joints;Kernel;Predictive models;Vectors;Solid modeling","driver information systems;Gaussian processes;image classification;image motion analysis;pedestrians;road safety;road vehicles;vectors","pedestrian path prediction;body language classification;action classification;safety-related driver assistance systems;pedestrian protection systems;commercial vehicles;3D pedestrian body language;GPDM;Gaussian process dynamical models;input vector dimensionality;3D pose space;pedestrian dynamics;3D pose transitions","","9","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This encourages highway users to ride together, thus, in theory, more efficiently transporting people through the highway system. In order to be effective, however, adherence to the vehicle occupancy rules has to be enforced. Recent studies have shown that the traditional approach of dispatching traffic law enforcement officers to perform roadside visual inspections is not only expensive and dangerous, but also ineffective for managed lane enforcement. In this paper, we describe an image-based machine learning approach for automatic or semi-automatic vehicle occupancy detection. Our method localizes windshield regions by constructing an elastic deformation model from sets of uniquely defined landmark points along the front windshield. From the localized windshield region, the method calculates image-level feature representations, which are then applied to a trained classifier for classifying the vehicle into violator and non-violator classes.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957856","","Automotive components;Vehicles;Error analysis;Cameras;Feature extraction;Road transportation;Face","feature extraction;image representation;inspection;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;traffic engineering computing","traffic volume;modern highways;transportation agencies;highway system;traffic law enforcement;roadside visual inspections;image-based machine learning approach;semi-automatic vehicle occupancy detection;elastic deformation model;image-level feature representations;nonviolator classes","","4","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To make up with this disadvantage, a interference-based capacity analysis is finished in this paper for the VANET scenario. For representing the unique constrain of inter-vehicle distance, which directly affects both the signal and interference power decaying, the car-following model is used to describe the vehicles' mobility feature. Based on that, a series of probability characteristics are derived for the worst interfered scenario, which finally leads to the expected VANET capacity.

In this paper we propose an effective heterogeneous solution to solve the congestion control problem in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) with the support of enhanced Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS) in LTE cellular systems.

One particular challenge is to plan for road capacities that will sustain the growing demand for surface transportation on the road network. For these cities, a sophisticated road infrastructure that includes sensors (e.g., loop detectors and traffic cameras) and/or probe vehicles equipped to detect pavement roughness are ideal for traffic infrastructure management. However, the cost of such tools for developing cities is often prohibitively expensive. For these reasons, road infrastructure management strategies that are able to leverage low-cost technologies and data resources are highly sought after in these areas. We refer to these strategies as frugal innovations. In this paper we explore a frugal approach for monitoring road quality in Nairobi, Kenya. Our aim is to use characteristics of speed distributions to detect the presence of pavement distresses (including speed bumps) for Nairobi, Kenya's road network. We first derive link speeds from mobile GPS traces, and then perform graphical as well as quantitative distributional comparisons of the speed distributions on travel network links with speed bumps present, compared to links without speed bumps present. Our results support our hypotheses that distributional comparisons on travel speeds can indeed serve as useful tools to detect the presence of speed bumps and other road distresses.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958175","","Roads;Vehicles;Global Positioning System;Data collection;Intelligent sensors;Cities and towns","data handling;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","road quality monitoring;city urbanization;city infrastructure;road capacity;surface transportation;road network;road infrastructure;pavement roughness;traffic infrastructure management;frugal innovation;frugal approach;Nairobi;Kenya;travel speed","","5","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In pedestrian detection, a robust feature descriptor that discriminates pedestrians from the background is a paramount step. Generally, pedestrians are detected with features extracted from visible images. However, those features can easily be contaminated by the changes of clothing color, illumination, body deformation, and complex backgrounds. These factors present great challenges for designing robust feature descriptors. In this study, we address this issue by proposing a new feature descriptor, namely, scattered difference of directional gradients (SDDG), for thermal images. Unlike visible images, thermal images are insensitive to illumination changes and immune to the variation of clothing color as well as the complexity of backgrounds. Compared with other feature descriptors, the SDDG captures more detailed local gradient information so that objects can be well described along certain directions. Experimental results demonstrate the comparable performance of the proposed feature descriptor with well-known feature descriptors, e.g. histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and Haar wavelets (HWs).","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958024","","Feature extraction;Lighting;Image segmentation;Image color analysis;Histograms;Support vector machines;Vectors","computer vision;feature extraction;infrared imaging;object detection;pedestrians;traffic engineering computing","pedestrian detection;thermal images;computer vision;feature extraction;robust feature descriptors;scattered difference of directional gradients;SDDG","","3","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is followed by maneuver-based, long-term trajectory predictions, which themselves contain random components due to the immanent uncertainty of how drivers execute specific maneuvers. Taking all uncertain predictions of all maneuvers of every vehicle into account, the probability of the ego vehicle colliding at least once within a time span is evaluated via Monte-Carlo simulations and given as a function of the prediction horizon. This serves as the basis for calculating a novel criticality measure, the Time-To-Critical-Collision-Probability (TTCCP) - a generalization of the common Time-To-Collision (TTC) in arbitrary, uncertain, multi-object driving environments and valid for longer prediction horizons.

The operational patterns of EV taxis should be different from Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEV) taxis: EVs can only travel a limited distance due to the limited capacity of the batteries and an EV taxi may re-charge several times throughout a day. Understanding the status (e.g., operational patterns, driver income and charging behaviours) of EV taxis can provide invaluable information to policy makers. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper to understand EV taxis behavior patterns. We use real taxi GPS records data from a fleet with about 600 EV taxis operating in Shenzhen, China. We study the patterns from two aspects: operational behaviors and charging behaviors. The most important finding is: based on the net profits of both EV and ICEV taxis, which are derived from data, we find that commercial operation of an EV taxi fleet can be profitable in metropolitan area, when specific policies give advantages to EV taxis.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958086","","Global Positioning System;Vehicles;Batteries;Cities and towns;Companies;Event detection;Equations","electric vehicles;Global Positioning System;internal combustion engines;public transport;road vehicles","charging patterns;operational patterns;electric vehicle taxis;charging infrastructure;public transportation;internal combustion engine vehicles;ICEV taxis;batteries;EV taxis behavior patterns;real taxi GPS record data;net profits;metropolitan area","","4","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, it is indispensable for autonomous driving vehicles and transportation devices to detect other cars or for the classification of obstacles. To enable this, relatively large real world images must be processed at high data rates. At the moment, Semi Global Matching (SGM) is the most promising approach for the stereo matching of real world images at sufficient quality and the capability of high data rates. Real-time SGM implementations on small image sizes have been reported, however, current stereo camera image sizes pose still high computational complexity and memory demand for SGM. This paper describes a new method for the efficient computation of stereo matching costs to reduce the complexity and the high memory demand for cost volume and cost aggregation buffering. Using the proposed complexity reduction, we present modules and concepts for full parallel FPGA implementations of the cost volume creation, SGM aggregation and disparity selection. We evaluate the presented algorithm using the KITTI stereo vision benchmark and achieve, besides competitive quality results, a data throughput for the cost calculation of 199 frames per second (fps) for an image size of 1242 × 375 with a disparity range of D = 160 and tremendously reduced memory requirements.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958182","","Transforms;Field programmable gate arrays;Benchmark testing;Stereo vision;Memory management;Throughput","automobiles;field programmable gate arrays;image classification;image matching;object detection;real-time systems;road traffic;stereo image processing;traffic engineering computing","cost computation algorithm;high speed FPGA architecture;high quality real-time semiglobal matching stereo vision;road scenes;stereo correspondence;disparity map;objects depth;camera based environment perception systems;autonomous driving vehicles;transportation devices;cars detection;obstacles classification;real world images;real-time SGM;small image sizes;stereo camera image sizes;computational complexity;memory demand;stereo matching costs;cost aggregation buffering;complexity reduction;full parallel FPGA implementations;cost volume creation;SGM aggregation;disparity selection;KITTI stereo vision benchmark;data throughput;disparity range;memory requirements","","4","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The work reported herein describes a novel algorithm based on particle filters for segmenting and tracking the edges of roads in real world scenarios. This is accomplished with the help of a video camera mounted on the vehicle. The measurement and prediction functions in particle filtering are modified suitably to measure and track road edges with time. One road measurement function and two different prediction functions are proposed and their performances are compared. The proposed measurement function is based on the familiar K-means clustering algorithm. The two prediction models considered are polynomial curve fitting and first order Auto Regressive (AR) models. This method of segmenting and tracking roads is tested on over 40 videos obtained from vehicles moving over a range of real world highways. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of handling partial occlusion of the road due to the presence of multiple objects, texture variations in the road, and abrupt illumination changes, such as extensive shadowing. Also owing to the fact that this approach is capable of operating satisfactorily at resolutions as low as 160×120 pixels, it places a very minimal computational load on the onboard Electronic Control Unit (ECU). By virtue of its robustness and ability to continuously adapt to changes in road conditions, the proposed method is a valid candidate for real time implementation.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957884","","Roads;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Vectors;Predictive models;Vehicles;Cameras","computer graphics;curve fitting;driver information systems;image segmentation;image texture;mobile robots;object tracking;particle filtering (numerical methods);pattern clustering;road vehicles;video cameras","road tracking;particle filters;advanced driver assistance systems;road segmentation and;ADAS;autonomous navigation;semiautonomous vehicle;edge segmentation;edge tracking;video camera;particle filtering;road measurement function;prediction function;K-means clustering algorithm;polynomial curve fitting;auto regressive model;AR model;partial occlusion;texture variation;onboard electronic control unit;ECU;robustness","","2","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, a new objective function is proposed to ensure the satisfaction of queue length constraints. A case study is implemented to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The results show that nominal MPC and nominal RHPC may result in a better performance than scenario-based min-max MPC and scenario-based min-max RHPC.

There are many route guidance systems (RGSs) providing rerouting suggestions for drivers to avoid on-going congestion. However, these systems use macroscopic approaches to generate flow-level route guidance and provide homogeneous guidance to all drivers that belong to the same flow, which may simply shift the on-going congestion from one point to another. In order to overcome the demerit of existing RGSs, we propose a RGS with a microscopic rerouting strategy to generate vehicle-level personalized route guidance. The mechanism of the proposed RGS is to rank the vehicles that need to be rerouted according to a certain criterion, and compute detour route sequentially for each vehicle based on effective link travel time (ETT). The ETT is updated every time a vehicle is rerouted to account for the potential impact of this vehicle on the following rerouting. Simulation studies show that with proper guidance update interval and ranking criterion, the proposed RGS successfully reduces the average travel time by 22% compared to the existing one. Besides, 40% less vehicles are involved in rerouting in the proposed RGS, and the average number of reroutings for each rerouted vehicles is reduced from 6.8 to only 1.6. Performance analysis on microscopic level suggests that the advantages of the proposed RGS may primarily come from the vehicles that are rerouted in both RGS and the vehicles that are rerouted in the existing RGSs but not in the proposed one, which in total takes up 77% of all the vehicles. The proposed RGS also left-shifts the distribution of travel time so that the complied drivers have high possibility of reducing travel time. We conclude that the proposed RGS with personalized rerouting strategy can not only improve the operation efficiency of a traffic network, but also give incentive to drivers to follow the guidance that they receive.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957652","","Vehicles;Roads;Microscopy;Mathematical model;Real-time systems;Equations;Computational modeling","road traffic;traffic engineering computing","route guidance system;personalized rerouting;traveling time reduction;urban road traffic congestion;RGS;macroscopic approach;flow-level route guidance;microscopic rerouting strategy;effective link travel time;ETT;traffic network","","2","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modern algorithms for estimating distances for every image pixel achieve high-quality results, but their real-time capability is very limited. In contrast, window-based local methods can be implemented very efficiently but are more prone to errors. This is particularly true for spatial changes of distance within the matching window, most prominently on surfaces such as the road which are not parallel to but rather slanted towards the image plane. In this paper we present a method to compensate the impact of this effect for arbitrarily oriented sets of planes. It does not depend on any modifications to the actual distance estimation.

A multiple-point-mass model for the high speed train against actuator failures is presented, in which the actuator failures including both partial loss of actuator effectiveness and complete breakdown are characterized by unknown varying parameters. A parallel control architecture is proposed by adding redundant control channels into closed loop to achieve the reliability of control strategy, which can ensure the stability of high speed train system when all actuators are operational as well as some actuators experience failures. In particular, our approach does not require any controller reconfiguration for occurrence of actuator failures, which is suitable for reliable control for high speed train with requirement of high reliability and safety. The controllers composing the parallel control strategy is considered as measurement feedback controllers, and the design procedure is eventually converted into a set of linear matrix inequality feasibility problems.

Current ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) warn the driver or apply the brakes shortly before the collision, but in some situations the collision cannot be fully avoided because most systems react only when the pedestrian is already in front of the vehicle. To fully avoid a collision, a driver should be warned earlier. Behavior prediction is a solution that can be used to warn a driver before the pedestrian starts crossing. In this paper, we propose a generic context based model to predict crossing behaviors of pedestrians in inner-city. We will show that our model provides accurate prediction at an early time. However, there are specific locations such as zebra crossings, where based on expert driving experience, one would expect that a prediction can be done even earlier. Therefore, we have developed an additional specific model fitted to the context of zebra crossings. The experiments show that this model produces both, better and earlier predictions in this specific context. Because our goal is to build a generic crossing prediction system, we finally apply the framework of the `Context Model Tree' to combine the two models. We demonstrate that this multi-model system is well suited to provide early predictions for realistic data, including both, generic inner-city situations and zebra crossings.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957720","","Roads;Predictive models;Vehicles;Context modeling;Context;Computational modeling;Trajectory","behavioural sciences;collision avoidance;driver information systems;pedestrians;road vehicles;trees (mathematics)","pedestrian crossing prediction;context-based models;vehicle-pedestrian collision;ADAS;advanced driver assistance systems;collision avoidance;behavior prediction;crossing behaviors;zebra crossings;crossing prediction system;context model tree;multimodel system;generic inner-city situation","","15","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The trackmap database is capable of providing the effective information for enhancing the positioning performance. In this paper, we use the concept of a Virtual Balise (VB) to enable a scheme for satellite-based train control that is interoperable with current CTCS (Chinese Train Control System). With the aid from a trackmap, the integration concerning the GNSS, odometer and map database is realized by using a nonlinear filter. In addition, unlike the existing works on VB capture with a loose-coupled structure, a novel solution for determining the status of VB capture and position calibration is proposed where the trackmap can positively estimate the relative situation between the train and the target Balise. Based on the cooperation between GNSS and the trackmap, both the functions of train location determination and Balise message control can be realized for generating the moving authorities for the trains.

This work investigates a multi-model approach for vehicle mass estimation based on common sensor signals for vertical dynamics as they are available in modern vehicle suspension systems with no need of a calibrated reference. For tracking the suspension dynamics, we partly use a Kalman filter with a linear dynamic system matrix.

The complexity of this task mainly stems from the fact that rational decision-making in this context must consider several sources of uncertainty: The temporal evolution of situations cannot be predicted without uncertainty because other road users behave stochastically and their goals and plans cannot be measured. Even more important, road users are only able to perceive a tiny part of the current situation with their sensors because measurements are noisy and most of the environment is occluded. In order to anticipate the consequences of decisions a probabilistic approach, considering both forms of uncertainty, is necessary. We address this by formulating the task of driving as a continuous Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that can be automatically optimized for different scenarios. As driving is a continuous-space problem, the belief space is infinite-dimensional. We do not use a symbolic representation or discretize the state space a priori because there is no representation of the state space that is optimal for every situation. Instead, we employ a continuous POMDP solver that learns a good representation of the specific situation.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957722","","Vehicles;Roads;Uncertainty;Decision making;Sensors;Complexity theory;Bayes methods","automobiles;decision making;decision theory;Markov processes;mobile robots;probability","probabilistic decision-making;autonomous driving;continuous POMDPs;tactical decision-making;rational decision-making;temporal evolution;continuous partially observable Markov decision process;continuous-space problem;belief space;infinite-dimensional;continuous POMDP solver","","36","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All of the GPS traces are segmented by the intersections, resulting in connectivity matrix of the intersections and small GPS tracks for each pair of directly-connected intersections. At last, the road between each two directly-connected intersections is extracted through aligning and averaging all of the tracks using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. The main novelty of our methods is aligning the tracks point by point for each road using a “stretching and compression” strategy, which not only allows road estimation by averaging the aligned tracks, but also a deeper statistical analysis using their time alignment, such as analyzing the users' speed stability at a specific location.

Studies show that drivers who have higher level of “driving discourtesy” (i.e rudeness and aggressiveness) have higher probability of performing risky driving behaviors including traffic rule violations. In this paper, we propose a model named Driving Discourtesy Model (DDM). In this model, a new indicator is defined to measure the “driving discourtesy”. With a probability distribution method, we are able to estimate the probability of performing risky driving behaviors of each vehicle based on a vehicle's individual influencing factors and situational factors.

Vehicles periodically exchange critical information with nearby vehicles to determine their maneuvers according to the information quality and established strategies. However, wireless communication is prone to failures. Thus, participants can be unaware that other participants have not received the information on time resulting in conflicting trajectories that may not be safe. We present a deterministic solution that allows all participants to use a default strategy when other participants have not received on time the complete information. We base our solution on a timed distributed protocol that adapts its output according to the effect of message omission failures so that the disagreement period occurs for no longer than a constant time (of the order of milliseconds) that only depends on the message delay. We formally show the correctness and perform experiments to corroborate its efficiency.

This paper investigates the taxiway planning problem. Different from existing related literatures which do not consider the runway exit selecting problem, the significance of runway exit selection for landing aircrafts is discussed. We propose a new conception, Runway Exit Availability (REA), to measure the probability that a flight clear the runway from a specific exit. Applying with REA, we can assign a proper exit to each landing flight. Besides, we construct a time-space network for the airport taxiing system. A mixed integer programming model based on this network is proposed for the assignment of 4D taxiing trajectories - routes and times. With taxiway operations of Beijing Capital International Airport as the testing background, experimental analysis shows that, the scheduling result by considering runway exit selection is superior to the result when exit selection is not considered and the calculation time of the scheduling process is acceptable for application in real systems.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958115","","Atmospheric modeling;Equations;Availability;Airports;Aircraft;Mathematical model;Planning","airports;integer programming;planning (artificial intelligence);probability;scheduling;trajectory optimisation (aerospace);vehicle routing","scheduling process;Beijing Capital International Airport;4D taxiing trajectories;mixed integer programming model;airport taxiing system;time-space network;probability;REA;runway exit availability;landing aircrafts;taxiway planning problem;airport runway capacity;runway exit selection;airport surface trajectory optimization","","1","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, taking eyes off from road is defined as distraction driving by United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and usually comes with abnormal head poses. This paper presents a distraction driving monitoring system based on dual compass head motion sensoring technology. The major difficulty is that single head-mounted sensoring device suffers from vehicle motion. When vehicle is moving, the sensory angle velocity from head-mounted compass includes vehicle motion, but not pure driver's head motion. The affected head angular velocity causes inaccurate subsequent analysis. Therefore, an additional compass was placed on vehicle for calibration and compensation. Then, abnormal head poses were applied to calculate distraction index. When distraction index was greater than a threshold, driver was warned to make sure driving safety. In addition, the distraction events can be feedback to driving behavior analysis platform. According to the collected data, the abnormal head pose events not only can be real-time warned to driver, but also can mine the common distraction patterns based on collaborative data analysis techniques. These data can be notified to driver for early reminder when drivers are approaching the common distraction road sections.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957879","Head pose analysis;Dual compass calibration;Distraction driving;Driving behavior analysis platform","Vehicles;Compass;Magnetic heads;Indexes;Vehicle dynamics;Accidents;Roads","behavioural sciences computing;image motion analysis;object recognition;road safety;traffic engineering computing","driver distraction recognition;distraction driving;United States Department of Transportation;USDOT;accident risks;distraction driving monitoring system;dual compass head motion sensoring technology;sensory angle velocity;distraction index;driving behavior analysis platform;collaborative data analysis techniques","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The former models do not consider the speed-density relations, and the latter models use the mismatched density information. In this paper, we propose a two-step travel delay estimation method to reach a better estimation of system states without losing efficiency. We describe the estimation method in discrete domain.

Consequently, it will offer new options and flexibilities in vehicle lateral motion control due to its structural merits. An In-wheel Electric Vehicle (IEV) powered by two independently embedded driven rear wheels, and with Steer-by-Wire is considered here. The present paper deals with the design of a yaw rate model matching controller intended to maintain vehicle steerability and lateral stability. The reference yaw rate is properly designed to enhance maneuverability when the vehicle is moving in the safety region, and to restrain the sideslip dynamics when the vehicle enters the critical driving zone. The difference between the stable and unstable regions is judged in the phase plane defined by the body sideslip angle and its velocity. The proposed MIMO controller, called VSSC (Vehicle Steerability and Stability Control), coordinates active steering and braking/traction wheel torques to achieve the control goals. VSSC is synthesized within the gain scheduled LPV framework based on ℋ<sub>∞</sub>robust performances. The conditions for designing such a controller are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) considering the polytopic approach.

The goal is to learn the basic behaviour of an unknown automatic transmission control software, only by investigating available input and output data. The knowledge can then be used to e.g. predict the fuel consumption of a vehicle or be used for other purposes that are not subject to this specific paper.

It may lead to poor performance if the taxi drivers cruise according to their own experience, especially for the freshmen. Therefore, it is valuable to recommend a profitable cruising route for the taxi drivers in order to increase their income and reduce waste in fuel. In this paper, we propose to use a system of linear equations to calculate the score of each road segment based on a large-scale real-world GPS data set. The score of each road segment consists of 1) the total income of the road segment and 2) the attractiveness of the drop-off location with respect to the next pick-up. Then, we get the profitable cruising route based on the score of each road segment using skyline computation. We build our system using historical data set generated by 12,000 taxis of Beijing in November 2012.

This new algorithm can coordinate a large number of on-ramps throughout a freeway network in a partially cooperative scheme. The communication is performed between neighboring on-ramps in a special serial fashion and with three different proposed cooperative schemes. The computation time is much less than that of existing distributed MPC approaches in the literature, while achieving a performance close to the one of the centralized MPC method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed partially cooperative schemes, a freeway network case study is selected and the problem of coordination between several on-ramps is solved using different methods from a centralized approach to a fully decentralized one. The obtained results show a significant decrease in the total computation time with respect to the centralized and fully cooperative schemes, while maintaining a close distance to the optimal objective function obtained from the centralized case.

Tracking objects on grid cells yields the advantage of a consistent environmental model on the occupancy grid map. We introduce the occupancy grid map as the only information source for the object tracking module. Taking advantage of the Dempster Shafer theory, a dynamic belief of conflicting cells can be estimated. This dynamic belief is then accumulated in a tracked object model.

Based on the proposed rate distortion model and traffic statistic information (vehicle density over a road), we can decide the best next-hop forwarding distance.

The problem is transformed into a mix integer linear programming problem, which can be solved using standard solvers. This proposed approach has three advantages over the traditional methods: (1) the proposed approach can handle various or even unknown travel time distributions, while traditional stochastic routing algorithms can only work on specified distributions; (2) the proposed approach does not rely on the assumption that the travel time on different road segments is independent from each other; (3) unlike other existing approaches which require that the deadline must be larger than a certain value, the proposed approach can support more flexible deadline definition.

The social contribution of the public transport industry is emphasized by governments because of its commonweal feature. This paper first defines the mathematical expression of the social contribution by utilizing multidimensional performance indicators, and deduces a set of constraints based on the proportional allocation concept (that is, the subsidy proportion allocated to each PTE should be equal to their social contribution proportion). The constraint set is the same as the efficient allocation set from the standpoint of data envelopment analysis.

In this paper, we propose a model that incorporates stochastic Markov regime switching model to estimate individual drivers characteristics and extract different driving regimes features. The proposed model takes into consideration the time factor and analyzes sequences of observations on driving time series. Trajectory data such as: velocity, acceleration, and space gap between leader and follower drivers were used as well as switching features to learn the model. Evaluation of the proposed model using real car following data sets shows that the model is able to classify normal car following driving behavior, rare events, and short time events. More importantly, the model is able to determine the switching dynamics among different regimes by applying maximum likelihood estimates and Hamilton filter. Additionally, the proposed model can infer regime specific characteristics, such as: expected duration, the probability of moving from one regime to another, switching parameters and driving patterns. Application of the proposed model includes- but not limited to: crash predication, and driver assistance and assessment systems.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957871","Car following model;regime classification;driver behavior;Markov switching Models","Switches;Mathematical model;Hidden Markov models;Biological system modeling;Vehicles;Acceleration;Markov processes","driver information systems;feature extraction;Markov processes;maximum likelihood estimation;time series","car following driving behavior;Markov regime switching model;driving regime feature extraction;driving time series;maximum likelihood estimates;Hamilton filter","","1","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It aims to optimally select some road segments to be reserved for buses in a predetermined bus transit network such that bus travelers can be rapidly transited. Two realistic assumptions are made in this work: 1) the total travel time on each bus route should be completed within a given deadline; 2) a lane on a road segment can be reserved for buses only when the bus volume on it exceeds a given level. The former guarantees bus travel time in order to improve the service level of a bus transit system. The second ensures minimum bus utilization on a reserved lane. However, private vehicles are not allowed to pass the bus exclusive lanes. Such a bus lane reservation strategy causes negative traffic impact on private vehicles. The objective of the problem is to minimize the negative traffic impact of reserved lanes. For the problem, we first construct an integer linear programming model and demonstrate its complexity to be NP-hard. Then, we propose a cut-and-solve algorithm to obtain its optimal solution.

In this paper, we propose an approach that allows the wireless channel load due to beacon transmissions to be significantly reduced while retaining very low traffic estimation error levels, by using tools from traditional traffic theory (such as the Cell Transmission Model, CTM) to analyze position and speed signals from infrequent wireless beacons and predict the dynamics of the traffic behavior in between.

Under one certain traffic scene, a higher score of model means that two intersections have closer relationship and the related link has a higher coordination priority. Hence, using this model, we can rank the coordination priority of links in the network.

First, it is shown that the relation between longitudinal alignment and traffic flow is important, whereas differences in driver characteristics, number of lanes, and overtaking have secondary effects since the bottleneck position is independent of day, time slot, and number of lanes. Second, to clarify the effect of longitudinal alignment on traffic flow, the accumulation of car-following method on a driving simulator is applied. Third, because traditional approaches that model traffic flow by car-following behavioral models and traffic flow simulation do not necessarily succeed in predicting bottleneck position, a new idea is proposed to extract the influence of longitudinal alignment on traffic flow. Based on the existence of exchange interactions in headways, the characteristics of traffic flow are condensed to a pair of variables, called hyperparameters, by hierarchical Bayesian estimation. The estimated hyperparameters are used to estimate flow.

Different from the detection method based on human shape analysis, this paper introduces a new method to detect walking people from their motion in the driving video. Motion profiles of the driving video are acquired where we found walking people showing their leg moving trajectories as twisted chains.

Thus we design a method to recognize chains uniquely at leg crossing by using HOG features and confirmed with template matching. This method can detect a person in two walking steps.

Active traffic and demand management (ATDM) methods, including Ramp Metering (RM), Variable Speed Limit (VSL), and Route Guidance (RG), can help delay or even avoid congestion. Currently, those measures have become predictive and integrated based on real-time data collection and facility coordination, e.g. Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based measures. In this generic approach, a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model is used for traffic state prediction and the control problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem; whereas, successful field implementation requires a computationally simple and accurate optimization technique to make it feasible in practice. In previous applications of MPC, common optimization techniques are the decision tree and sequential quadratic programming (SQP). They both perform well, but limited research has been conducted to assess and compare their effectiveness and efficiency. To address this research gap, this study tested their performance by applying an MPC-based VSL control. Using geometric and traffic data from an authentic freeway corridor, this paper discussed the speed limit sequences, measures of effectiveness (MOEs), and computation time from micro-simulation tests. The results of this comparative study can guide future filed implementation as a reference.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958033","active traffic demand management;variable speed limit;model predictive control;non-linear optimization problem;optimization technique","Optimization;Decision trees;Traffic control;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Vehicles;Linear programming","decision trees;predictive control;quadratic programming;road traffic control;velocity control","numerical optimization techniques;model predictive variable speed limit control;freeway congestion;worldwide traffic problem;traffic demand;active traffic;ATDM methods;ramp metering;RM;route guidance;RG;real-time data collection;facility coordination;MPC-based measures;second-order macroscopic traffic flow model;traffic state prediction;nonlinear optimization problem;decision tree;sequential quadratic programming;SQP;MPC-based VSL control;traffic data;authentic freeway corridor;MOE;microsimulation tests","","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose to detect specific types of vehicles, such as buses, so that they can be assigned higher priority when appropriate and the overall effectiveness of the adaptive signal system can be improved.

In this paper, a new approach is proposed to improve energy efficiency by optimising the vertical alignment at stations along metro route. Firstly, we develop a simplified route with one station in the middle to analyse the relationship between energy consumption and the parameters of vertical alignment at the station. Secondly, we carry out an optimisation simulation on vertical alignment at Beijing Subway Yizhuang Line No.5 station. The results show that the energy consumption could be reduced by 1.66%. Finally, the optimisation simulations are extended to the entire Yizhuang Line. The results show that with adding optimal vertical alignments at all stations, the total energy consumption and journey time could be reduced by 5.6% and 0.53%, respectively.

This concept, known as self-automated parking lots, can be improved if a reasonable prediction of the exit time of each car that enters the parking lot is used to try to optimize its initial placement, in order to reduce the mobility necessary to extract blocked cars.

The growing urbanization indicates the situation can be even worse. A traffic demand higher than the urban capacity generates traffic congestions, which can be reduced through an efficient traffic signal control method. This paper presents a Biologically-Inspired Neural Network for traffic signal control. Instead of focusing on the macroscopic optimization of urban traffic, like other works, the hereby proposed control method investigates a single intersection between streets. This way, it is possible to incorporate more knowledge about the system dynamics into the control model and analyze its effects on control efficiency. The proposed method consists of a competitive neural network, which balances feedforward and feedback inhibition to synchronize the activity of the neurons, and, thus, the semaphore activation. Moreover, other proprieties of biological neurons are adopted: intrinsic plasticity, to impose system constraints; and synaptic plasticity, to prioritize traffic flows. The flexibility of the neurons and its synaptic connections regarding parameter definition constitute the capacity of easily incorporating knowledge about the system dynamics into the control model. Results of comparative simulations validate the proposed method and illustrate its efficiency and consistency.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958020","","Neurons;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles;Mathematical model;Biological neural networks;Equations;Feedforward neural networks","feedforward neural nets;road traffic control;synchronisation","biologically-inspired neural network;urban mobility;urbanization;traffic demand;urban capacity;traffic congestion generation;traffic signal control method;road intersections;system dynamics;control efficiency;competitive neural network;feedforward inhibition;feedback inhibition;neuron activity synchronization;semaphore activation;biological neuron proprieties;intrinsic plasticity;system constraints;synaptic plasticity;traffic flow prioritization;synaptic connections;neuron flexibility","","4","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three policies are considered: shortest path, reservation and congestion avoidance. Furthermore, three traffic contexts are considered and simulated. Since, the traffic management at intersections is adapted to the currently observed vehicles, then the simulation shows that it is required to define new policy that considers the overall network performance rather than optimizing the route of each vehicle according to a given criteria.

However, the acceptance of TSP is limited, as its application can result in delays to the general traffic. In the future traffic signals will broadcast Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) status information to nearby vehicles. Thanks to this, TSP could be complemented with in-vehicle systems such as Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) and Green Light Optimal Dwell Time Advisory (GLODTA). They allow a bus to pass through signalised intersections during a green phase, without modifying signal timings. Therefore they do not create delays to the general traffic. The objective of this paper is to analyse how the two systems can complement TSP and to which extend they can be used instead of TSP.

In automobile applications, conventional calibration approaches that use man-made patterns are inconvenient and the existing self-calibration techniques cannot produce enough accurate calibration results. In this work, we propose a self-calibration method to recalibrate stereo rig automatically as well as precisely by utilizing onroad markings. First, the system detects crosswalks and extracts their corners in the two images respectively.

"SCATS Ramp Metering: Strategies, arterial integration and results","J. C. Aydos; A.

A ramp metering implementation can present some problems to the adjacent arterial network. One source of these problems is the treatment of motorways and arterial network as two separate areas of control. This paper presents three novel methods for ramp metering. The three methods are aimed at promoting a coordinated, efficient and integrated ramp metering approach. These methods are integrated in the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) Ramp Metering System which currently controls the largest southern-hemisphere ramp metering network. The achievements of these methods are demonstrated by years of before and after field data from Auckland, New Zealand. An average 25% improvement in both congestion duration and traffic speed is achieved as well as an 8% increase in throughput. A total of 22% reduction in crashes is also demonstrated. Based on average results of 25 surveyed sites, the estimated annual benefits for a ramp metering site are a reduction of 26K hours of delay and a reduction of 6 crashes. In terms of economic value, this results in an estimated annual cost reduction of AU$2M per ramp metering site. These estimates were designed to exclude benefits from any civil works resulting in capacity increases to the motorway network.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958028","","Detectors;Reluctance motors;Delays;Vehicles;Optimization;Roads;Approximation methods","cost reduction;metering;road traffic control","SCATS ramp metering;dynamic traffic management tool;arterial network;coordinated integrated ramp metering approach;Sydney coordinated adaptive traffic system ramp metering system;southern hemisphere ramp metering network;Auckland;New Zealand;traffic speed;cost reduction;motorway network","","5","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A chessboard is devised for representing the street players, each of which carries different potential risks. Every square of the chessboard refers to a partition, which can host one or multiple players. Further, a partition can have different risks for a driver. The proposed model is realized using a graph-cut algorithm for energy minimization. Each partition is considered as a vertex of the graph, which can transfer risks caused by street players. Vertexes are formed via behavior as those of memory cell structures. The memory cells have risk transfer capabilities allowing a driver to determine momentarily risks on urban traffic.

The poles and supporting arms of power supply lines are detected firstly to yield the region of interest for detailed processing. Then the hypothesis of potential abnormal pattern are collected from the endpoints extracted from local curve and line segments, so as to strengthen the perceptual difference.

As these errors may lead to severe application level failures, early and reliable detection of these errors, generally termed map verification, is a must. This work presents an online approach to verification of digital maps for automotive use based on neural multi-sensor fusion. Unlike previous works, the system is able to verify the digital map integrity ahead of the vehicle, before the error position is reached. Thus, appropriate countermeasures to mitigate possible effects can be initiated upfront. On the basis of a large database of map geometry and sensor information, a neural network is trained to classify the digital map integrity by optimally fusing sensor information at different abstraction levels. Using this technique, our system is able to verify the map integrity 100 meters ahead of the vehicle with an error rate of less than 3.4 %, while being real-time capable at the same time.

At the same time, most evacuation studies (where the driving performance is explicitly accounted for) were conducted under the assumption of a fully activated emergency environment. However, the transition phase in evacuation, from normal driving situations to emergency driving situations, and also its implication for traffic management has not yet been widely studied. During this phase, drivers receive evacuation information and instructions at different levels, which may induce heterogeneous behavioural driving response. The action and interaction of heterogeneous drivers would influence traffic flow operations. This paper is the pioneer to investigate this transition phase at the early stage of emergency situations and its implications for traffic flow and traffic management. This is tested via a simulation study using a recently-developed open-source microscopic simulation platform, where the driver behaviour (activation level, transition period) can be specified or influenced by traffic management measures.

To address these issues and considering the realistic context of autonomous road vehicles, this paper proposes a fast RRT algorithm that introduces an off-line template set based on the traffic scenes and an aggressive extension strategy of search tree. Both improvements can lead to a faster and more accurate RRT towards the goal.

To measure the similarity between detected junction string and ground truth junction string, we design a weighted edit distance strategy and assign different deviation with different weight so that our framework is robust enough to deviations in arrow road marking but sensitive to non- arrow road markings' deviations. To test our framework, we collect three freeway datasets with our self-driving car: clean/dirty arrow road marking images (300 images respectively), a video dataset (arrow road marking and non-road marking images (670 images)).

This information is needed when planning to implement dynamic traffic management measures. Ex-ante evaluations are usually performed by means of a simulation study. However, it is hard to reproduce realistic traffic flow characteristics in a simulation. This makes it hard to assess the potential benefits of a dynamic traffic management measure. An ex-ante data analysis, however, can provide insight into the benefits of such a measure. Therefore, a theoretical framework will be provided for analyzing the potential of jam prevention at fixed, infrastructural bottlenecks first. Then, a similar framework is developed to assess moving jam resolvability. Finally, this method is applied to off-line inductive loop detector data of the A13 freeway in the Netherlands in order to assess moving jam resolvability.

Firstly, in order to follow the reference path with smooth motions and avoid obstacles as well, we apply an efficient model-based predictive trajectory planner, which considers geometric information of the desired path, kinematic constraints and partial-dynamic constraints to obtain a collision-free, and dynamically-feasible trajectory in each planning cycle. Then, the generated trajectory is fed to the low-level trajectory tracking controller.

In this paper, only phase split is tuned iteratively to balance the traffic demands from all directions in a junction. Each junction has its own controller and these controllers can work cooperatively to improve the network performance after several iterations.

We model each traffic signal junction as an independent agent. An agent decides the signal duration of its phases in a round-robin (RR) manner using multi-agent Q-learning with either ε-greedy or UCB [3] based exploration strategies. It updates its Q-factors based on the cost feedback signal received from its neighbouring agents. This feedback signal can be easily constructed and is shown to be effective in minimizing the average delay of the vehicles in the network.

Experiments are first carried out at a Braess network to illustrate principal ideas and DTA simulations are then performed on an urban network to find out traffic performance at a real network. Our main research question consists of finding out what impact of multi-criteria cost function has on network traffic performance and thus traffic management, and whether we could achieve improvement in both travel time and emission at the same time? The experiment and simulation show that (1) a careful design of cost function with survey-supported cost coefficients would provide a solution to an optimized routing in multi-criteria traffic management (either at EU or SO), and (2) the network total travel time and emission could be effectively reduced when a routing strategy is well tuned and the emission is used as feedback in the system's control loop.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958072","","Routing;Cost function;Vehicles;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Roads","network theory (graphs);road traffic","multicriteria routing;dynamic traffic management;traffic simulation;cost function;vehicle emission;network performance;vehicle movement;bi-level approach;Braess network;multicriteria traffic management;routing strategy","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The changed vibration modal function and frequency of track are used in calculating the dynamic response of vehicle-track coupling model. It can be seen from the dynamic responses that vibration frequency is shifted and amplitude peak is enhanced by thermal stress.

Stationary sensors usually have less measurement noise than mobile sensors but their network coverage is limited. On the other hand, mobile sensors, commonly installed in fleet vehicles, cover relatively wider areas of the network but they suffer from low penetration rate and low sampling frequency. Traffic state estimations can benefit from fusion of data collected by various sources as they complement each other. The proposed estimation method is implemented using FCD from taxis and the ANPR data from Stockholm, Sweden.

In this paper we evaluate the repercussions of partial information on the overall traffic view, and consequently on the outcome of the optimization. Our study focuses on the role of the user participation rate and the availability of Road Side Units to collect the FCD.

In this paper, a stochastic model is proposed to estimate the second-by-second trajectories using sparse mobile sensor data. The proposed model investigates all possible driving mode sequences between data points. The likelihood of each scenario is quantified with mode-specific a priori distributions. Detailed trajectories are then reconstructed based on the optimal driving mode sequences. The proposed method is calibrated and validated using NGSIM data.

In this paper, we develop an agent-based online adaptive signal control (ASC) strategy based on real-time traffic information available from CV technology.

We have tested our method on a rich dataset of driving sessions, carried out in a professional simulator, involving a panel of volunteer drivers. Each session included a different type of cognitive distraction, and resulted in multiple time series from a variety of on-board sensors as well as sensors worn by the driver.

However so far, this work has focused mainly on achieving more efficient vehicle flows and on reducing emissions, and the broader mobility of other modes of traffic that are central to sustainable urban living - especially pedestrians - has not been emphasized in an integrated way. In this paper, we extend this decentralized, schedule-driven approach to traffic network control in the direction of this broader mobility objective. We focus specifically on accommodating pedestrians and optimizing the delay tradeoffs between vehicles and pedestrians. Three basic extensions are introduced and evaluated on a real-world road network. Simulation results are first presented which analyze the ability of the extended approach to achieve good delay tradeoffs under different pedestrian traffic conditions.

The expected situation is that the regenerative braking energy is absorbed by other trains in the same power supply section as much as possible.

Various approaches have been proposed to reduce traffic jams. Recently, researchers have started to employ connected vehicle (CV) technology. Most solutions, however, rely on a binary approach to determine a traffic jam, i.e., whether it exists or not. Accordingly, output given to a driver in the form of driving advisory also tends to be binary and static. However, a traffic jam is a dynamic phenomenon, the intensity of which changes over time depending on various factors including randomness of driving behavior and road conditions. In this paper, we propose to integrate a fuzzy inference system into a traffic-jam-control algorithm such that the dynamics of a traffic jam is effectively represented, thereby providing diversified driving advisory depending upon the intensity of a traffic jam.

Based on this, we can build the map of the environment and decide the behaviours of the vehicle in the future. Since a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is inaccurate and not available in all situations, the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technique has been introduced to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a hybrid map-based SLAM using Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPFs). Especially, it was designed with the Velodyne 3D HDL-64 laser scanner which provides rich and accurate data of spatial information around the vehicle. Therefore, our work comprises not only the RBPFs framework but also some signal preprocessing procedures of the sensor. Unlike prior works, we describe the environment by using a grid map and a feature map together rather than using only one of them. Based on both maps, we have formulated a new proposal distribution which is an important performance factor of the algorithm.

To achieve satisfactory slip velocity tracking, an optimal seeking strategy is introduced to provide the desired slip velocity. It is shown that the proposed strategy can automatically adjust the control torque to drive the train in the way to make it operate away from slip region but closer to the neighborhood of the optimal adhesion point, such that preferable traction/braking capability is guaranteed after re-gaining adhesion.

However, due to lack of models, most proposed solutions need individual sensing system tuning or training based on extensive experiments to capture overall system characteristics and usually the outcomes can't be applied to other systems due to various factors, e.g., the suspension systems of vehicles, the mounting racks or adhering methods, the weight of the onboard device, and even the position on the vehicle. It becomes an obstacle for pervasive deployment of such systems. In this work, we intend to verify the feasibility of modeling vibrations measured by onboard devices by underdamped oscillation model (UOM) through time and frequency domain analyses. If the vibrations of the phone can be modeled by UOM, the measurement uncertainties caused by various factors that affect the sensed vibrations may potentially be eliminated. The vibrations caused by road anomalies could be measured in a relative objective way by the ratio of the vibration caused by road anomalies and the background vibrations.

Objective: This work focuses on the systematic generation of possible vehicle trajectories within the allowed tolerance ranges for a simulation environment. It is of great interest to which extent the different test parameters will affect the brake timepoints in each test case as well as the residual velocity in case of a collision with a target vehicle. Method: A formal model using a graph-based representation of the allowed variances based on relevant time-points allows the selection of relevant trajectories as test cases. These trajectories are simulated afterwards to investigate its influence on the system's performance. Results: The systematic approach unveiled varying action points in time of the software of an emergency braking guard, which could influence the overall result of a consumer test.

Though EV Buses are environment-friendly, the buses as well as the charging facilities including quick chargers and rechargeable Stationary Storage Batteries (SSBs) are expensive. Therefore, it is expected that in near future some of the city buses of a route will be replaced with EV Buses, and SSBs along with grid power will be used to charge these buses. In that situation, proper operation and charging scheduling of the EV Buses will be needed. In this paper, we propose a k-Greedy Algorithm-based approach for this task. We perform simulations by using the real bus diagram data of four bus routes of a city bus route network in Japan and evaluate the algorithm from various perspectives.

This approach consists of classifying each stand based according to the type of services that are being requested (for instance, short and long trips). This classification is achieved by maintaining a time-evolving histogram to approximate local probability density functions (p.d.f.) in service revenues. The future values of this histogram are estimated using time series analysis methods assuming that a non-homogeneous Poisson process is in place. Finally, the method's outputs were combined using a voting ensemble scheme based on a sliding window of historical data.

Therefore, a vision-based nighttime bicycle and motorcycle detection method relying on use of a camera and near-infrared lighting mounted on an auto vehicle is proposed in this paper. Generally, the foreground objects in front of the auto, not the far-away background, will reflect near-infrared lighting in the nighttime environments. However, some components of the bicycles and the motorcycles absorb most infrared lighting and thus make the bicycles and motorcycles hardly recognizable. To cope with this problem, the aforementioned detection method is part-based, which combines the two kinds of features related to the characteristics of bicycles and motorcycles. Also, the information about the geometric relation among all the parts and the object centroid is learned off-line. Due to high computation load, Adaboost algorithm is used to select effective parts with better geometric information for detection. To validate the proposed results, several experiments are conducted to show that the developed system is reliable in detecting bicycles and motorcycles in the nighttime.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957716","On-road Bicycle and Motorcycle Detection;Feature Integration;Nighttime","Bicycles;Mathematical model;Motorcycles;Equations;Training","bicycles;cameras;infrared imaging;learning (artificial intelligence);motorcycles;object detection;road accidents;traffic engineering computing","edge feature;onroad bicycle detection;light vehicles;onroad accidents;vision-based nighttime bicycle detection;vision-based nighttime motorcycle detection;camera;near-infrared lighting;auto vehicle;foreground object;nighttime environment;geometric relation;object centroid;computation load;Adaboost algorithm","","6","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Structural time series models allow the various components of a time series such as level, seasonal and regression effects to be modelled separately to allow analysis of previous trends and forecasting. In this paper, a case study at a segregated bicycle lane in Dublin, Ireland was performed to test the forecasting accuracy of structural time series models applied to continuous observations of cyclist traffic volumes. It has been shown that the proposed models can produce accurate peak period forecasts of cyclist traffic volumes at both 1 hour and fifteen minute resolution and that the percentage errors are lower for hourly forecasts. The inclusion of weather metrics as explanatory variables had varying effects on the forecasting accuracies of the models.

Motivated by this observation, we establish in this work a wheel skid prediction method by using the support vector machine (SVM) technique that has been proven effective for linear and nonlinear classification and prediction. It is shown that by modifying the bias parameter of the SVM classifier, the proposed method can predict the trend of wheel skid rapidly before wheel skid is upcoming, thus an active antiskid control can be activated in advance to avoid wheel skid.

Consequently, existing methods that evaluate driving safety perform inadequately since they consider only limited factors and their effects. As such, it is difficult for vehicle kinematics- and dynamics-based driving safety assistant systems to adapt to increasingly complex traffic environments. In this study, we propose a new concept, driving safety field. The concept makes use of field theory to represent the risks of driving caused by drivers, vehicles, roads, and other traffic factors. A unified model of the driving safety field is constructed, which includes the following three parts: i) a potential field, which is determined by no-moving objects on the roads, such as a stopped vehicle; ii) a kinetic field, which is determined by the moving objects on roads, such as vehicles and pedestrians; and iii) a behavior field, which is determined by the driver's individual characteristics. Moreover, the model's application in a typical car-following scenario is illustrated, which evaluates the risks caused by traffic factors. The driving safety field can reveal driver-vehicle-road interactions and their influences on driving safety in order to predict trends of dynamic changes in driving safety. In addition, it can provide a new platform for driving safety measures and active vehicle control under complex traffic environments.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957815","","Vehicles;Roads;Safety;Vectors;Kinetic theory;Accidents;Adhesives","road safety;road traffic","driving safety field;driver-vehicle-road interactions;field theory;potential field;kinetic field;behavior field;car-following scenario;traffic factors;driving safety dynamic changes;active vehicle control;complex traffic environments","","3","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This mechanism, which we term dynamic attention priors (DAP), is inspired by recent results on predictive visual attention in humans and can be implemented at negligible computational cost. We prove experimentally, using a set of public, annotated pedestrian sequences, that detection performance is improved significantly, especially in cases where pedestrians differ from the learned models, e.g., when they are too small, have an unusual pose or occur before strongly structured backgrounds.

We show in this paper that the solutions proposed in the literature are unrealistic in terms of communication possibilities and that they do not allow a measure of the vehicular queue length at a lane level. Based on extensive experimental results, we propose an energy efficient, low cost and lightweight multihop wireless sensor network architecture to measure with a good accuracy the vehicle queue length, in order to have a more precise vision of traffic at the intersection.

In our study, different from previous researches, we studied characteristics of pedestrian behaviors within different widths of one exit, different locations of two exits and also enlarged the room size and number of pedestrians. We focus on the bunch-forming phenomenon and human's behavior without visibility. The evacuation process was observed and recorded by video cameras. Different from the people with visibility, blindfolded people showed a typical behavior. During the evacuation, the flow of people is discovered divided into several bunches. Based on the video observation and data statistics, it is found that no jamming through exit even the density near the exit reaches 3.29 people/m<sup>2</sup>.

We concentrate on two effects: First, the influence of the position and size of an obstacle in front of an emergency exit on the flux through the exit, and second, the influence of other pedestrians on the route choice of an individual. The first investigation demonstrates the possibility of improving substantially the flow through an exit by placing an obstacle in a suitable way in front of it. The latter shows clearly bistable states and hysteresis effects, indicating the existence of unstable pedestrian flow states in addition to the stable states. Furthermore, this set-up is an example of a radical change of the pedestrian flux by only a small change in the geometry of the evacuation scenario.

This model is inspired by the functions that appear in partition of unity in the differential geometry field. When observing images captured in fog conditions, usually the fog has a very low density in front of the camera and this density has a non-linear increase with the distance, such that objects are no longer visible at greater distances. By using our mathematical model we are able to obtain superior reconstructions of the original fog-free image, when comparing to traditional methods. Another advantage of our method is the ability to adapt the model in accordance to the density of the fog. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation is performed on both synthetic and real camera images. This evaluation proves that our mathematical model is more suitable for image enhancement in both homogeneous and heterogeneous fog conditions.

Previous research reported that the Agile Methodology fosters trust between the development team and the product owner and subsequently the trust improves communications about requirements and expectations with the product owner, and promotes collaborations within the development team. This helped our understanding of the role of trust in Agile methodology; however, it failed to answer the question of why trust is so important in Agile methodology while it has not been so in traditional software development methods. In this paper we use a social complexity approach to investigate the software development process. By looking at software development as a complex endeavor, and using tools and techniques from the Cynefin framework and other models of social complexity, we demonstrate that the increased level of complexity of the software has led to an increase in the level of complexity of the software development process. It transforms the software development process from a simple and complicated process to a complex one. Trust, which functions to resolve complexity, becomes an important factor in such a software development environment.

It involves various society's actors such as politicians, environmental analysts, energy providers, customers, business partners, etc. Offering analytical tools to analyze the <i>EM</i> activities represents a crucial issue for the involved actors. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of the usage of electrical vehicles. We focus on two main actors of <i>EM</i>: the French energy provider EDF and the users of electrical vehicles. EDF is in charge of providing energy power for electrical vehicles equipped with sensors. To understand the behavior of end users, our first contribution is the proposition of a data warehouse solution to store the large amount of data generated by sensors. Due to the heterogeneity of sensors sources, this data warehouse is based on a domain ontology developed in a modular way. An important aspect for EDF is the exploitation of the data warehouse by the means of business processes to obtain indicators, generate invoices, etc. Usually, these processes are defined outside the data warehouse and developed by software engineers. This solution is insufficient in our context, as EDF engineers are regularly designing, modifying and refining indicators. Our second contribution consists in connecting business processes to the domain ontology and then storing them within the data warehouse to avoid costly solutions such as outsourcing or training EDF engineers. Our proposal is implemented in a real scenario developed by EDF.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957761","","Ontologies;Business;Data warehouses;Sensors;Communities;Vehicles","business data processing;data warehouses;electric vehicles;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","semantic data warehouse;electrical vehicle data;business processes;electric mobility;EM;domain ontology","","1","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then the economy of charging infrastructure operation was analyzed and evaluated. The results indicated that the payback period of the charging infrastructure investment is still very long. The charging mode is more suitable for the electric bus. If the government provides electricity subsidies and battery swapping subsidies for infrastructure operators, the infrastructure economy will be significantly improved.

This method is supposed to be effective in describing the different characteristics of the urban traffic networks, so as to predict the accurate positions of the traffic jams at the intersections. The main research includes that: (1) we propose a practical approach to mapping the urban traffic topological structure into a modified BML (M-BML) model; (2) we propose the solutions to the conflict points and the fuzzy points in the mapping strategy from the M-BML model to the urban traffic road networks. Extensive experiments are carried out, which reveal that when the vehicle flow density ranges between 0.3 and 0.7, the traffic jams prediction accuracy is 81.25% by the proposed M-BML.

To achieve this, it is necessary to develop a method to predict the detectability of a pedestrian by the driver. This paper proposes a method for predicting the pedestrian detectability adaptive to the characteristics of the human visual field. We prepared image features effective for the different regions of the human visual field; central and peripheral, in order to predict the pedestrian detectability correctly. To obtain the ground truth of the pedestrian detectability, we conducted an experiment by human subjects using image sequences captured by an omnidirectional camera including pedestrians.

First, the proposed method extracts a patch-based sparse feature computed with a discriminate dictionary. With dualizing the sparse feature, the spatial pyramid model is employed to generate a long but sparse feature. At last, SVM with the histogram intersection kernel finishes the ultimate classification task. Diverse from the traditional bag of features model employed to compute the histogram in each level of the spatial pyramid, this paper codes the image patch with a fine learned and discriminate dictionary for a better representation than the gradient-based feature extraction.

Some VANET-based applications might require organising vehicles into groups (communities). However, the high mobility of the vehicles and their tendency to travel in clustered flows makes them a challenging subject for community detection. Communities should be formed on the fly, using only local knowledge about their neighbourhood, and evolve as vehicles move over time. The main goal of this paper is to evaluate if stable community detection is possible in highly dynamic VANETs. To do so, the SandSHARC algorithm is extended with two different stability metrics: link duration and mobility similarity. In order to evaluate the stability of the evolving mobile communities, new quantitative and qualitative metrics are proposed, and run simulations on two different VANET scenarios: highway and urban. We analyse how the two stability metrics improve the stability of the detected communities. The results demonstrate that stability depends on the mobility patterns of the underlying traffic network. The proposed method can be applied in a distributed manner and produces communities with robust communication links between members what makes it viable for VANET applications.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957846","","Communities;Vehicles;Stability analysis;Measurement;Mobile communication;Vehicle dynamics;Mobile computing","mobility management (mobile radio);radio links;telecommunication traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","sharper heuristic for assignment of robust community;stability and network dynamics;mobility similarity stability metric;link duration stability metric;wireless VANET traffic mobility pattern;robust communication link;SandSHARC algorithm;stable mobile community detection;vehicular ad hoc network","","1","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to offload the network, solutions that range from transmit rate to transmit power adaptations including hybrid solutions have been proposed. Although some of these solutions have managed to successfully reduce the load on the wireless channel, none, to the best of our knowledge, have considered the impact of the applied adaptation scheme on the overall level of awareness among vehicles and its quality. ETSI TS released a technical specification stating a limit for the minimum beacons transmit rate in order to maintain a good level of awareness among vehicles and ensure a certain accuracy in VANET applications. In this paper, we propose to jointly adapt both transmit rate and power in a new smart way that guarantees a strict beaconing frequency as well as a good level of awareness in closer ranges, while maintaining a marginal beacons collision rate and a good level of channel utilisation. First, the transmit rate is adapted to meet the channel requirements in terms of collision rate and channel load; then, once the minimum beacon transmit rate, set by ETSI, has been reached, transmit power is adapted in a way that guarantees a good level of awareness for closer neighbours. The simulation results show a significant enhancement in terms of the quality as well as the level of awareness.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957777","","Vehicles;Safety;Roads;Educational institutions;Telecommunication standards;Vehicular ad hoc networks","road safety;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication power management;vehicular ad hoc networks","smart adaptation;beacon transmission rate;vehicular awareness;VANET;control channel congestion;CCH congestion;safety messages dissemination;transmit rate;transmit power adaptations;wireless channel;ETSI TS;beaconing frequency;beacon collision rate;channel utilisation;channel load","","12","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The driving range of electric vehicles is subject to onboard battery capacities and electricity consumption states as well as network-wide battery-recharging opportunities, which inevitably raise the so-called “range anxiety” concern in the driving population. In addition to varying battery capacities and electricity consumption rates, the variation of driving distance limits perceived by individual drivers is also a reflection of their heterogeneous perception errors and risk-taking behaviors to battery depletion. This paper presents a convex programming model with a finite number of constraints for characterizing the proposed problem, based on the introduction of a new path flow variable called cumulative path flow rate. A linear approximation algorithm was further developed, encapsulating an efficient k-shortest path search procedure to perform the network loading. Numerical results obtained from conducting quantitative analyses on example networks clearly illustrate the applicability of the modeling and solution methods for the proposed problem and reveal the mechanism of stochastic distance limits impacting the network equilibrium.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958091","","","convex programming;electric vehicles;network theory (graphs);secondary cells;traffic","network loading;shortest path search procedure;linear approximation algorithm;cumulative path flow rate;convex programming model;network wide battery recharging opportunity;plug-in electric vehicles;traffic networks;stochastic distance constraints;traffic assignment problem;stochastic range anxiety;network equilibrium","","1","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We port this idea to the infrared domain. Our contributions reside in the combination of four channel features, namely infrared, histogram of gradient orientations, normalized gradient magnitude and local binary patterns with the objective of detecting pedestrians for night vision applications dealing with far infrared sensors. Multiple scale feature computation is done by feature approximation. Another contribution is the study of different formulations for Local Binary Patterns like uniform patterns and rotation invariant patterns and their effect on detection performance.

Whereas technical solutions have been tested for more than 20 years, psychological effects of highly automated driving became subject to debate in the last decade. Recent studies revealed that switching from highly automated to manual driving mode produces some difficulties for drivers. Therefore, the present driving simulator study investigates drivers' performance before (pre-automation) and after (post-automation) highly automated convoy driving (platooning). Hence it represents a more fine granulated analysis of a simulator experiment from Skottke et al. [1]. The pre-/post-comparison of driver performance shows whether driving behavior is more risky after 33km (20 min.) of highly automated driving in a platoon with a time headway of 0.3 sec.. Results showed that drivers significantly decreased their distance to the lead vehicle in the post-automation driving period compared to their pre-automation duration. Moreover, lateral vehicle control and driving speed differed between pre- and post-automation periods as well. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that highly automated driving critically affects drivers' post-automation behavior.

This paper was based on a detailed traffic dataset including traffic flow rate, density and speed with a resolution of fifteen minutes of the whole year 2005 from detector W64-07 at highway I-64 West, Virginia. These three variables, plus another three corresponding ones: season, day of the week and hour of the day, form the records of the new dataset I. Then for each variable of dataset I, fuzzy c-means method was applied, and the continuous values of each variable were replaced with the discrete cluster values, which produced the second new dataset II. At last, based on dataset II, frequent pattern tree was taken to find the most frequent patterns under certain combinations of season, day of the week and hour of the day. For these patterns, the statistical features of volume, velocity and density distributions were investigated and compared with each other. The results show season, day of the week and hour of the day all have impacts on the traffic characteristics. Besides that, the frequent patterns under congestion conditions were also analyzed. These frequent patterns can provide useful information for traffic control and guidance.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957941","","Traffic control;Databases;Educational institutions;Vehicles;Clustering methods;Springs;Curve fitting","fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;road safety;road traffic;statistical analysis;traffic engineering computing;trees (mathematics)","urban freeway traffic flow characteristics;frequent pattern tree;traffic management;traffic dataset;traffic flow rate;traffic flow density;traffic flow speed;highway I-64;Virginia;fuzzy c-means method;discrete cluster values;statistical features;density distributions;congestion conditions;traffic control;traffic guidance","","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm was named the traffic assignment by paired alternative segments (TAPAS) algorithm. This paper presents an improved TAPAS algorithm (termed iTAPAS) that enhances the original TAPAS mainly in two aspects: (1) a new PAS identification method is proposed; (2) each PAS is only associated with one origin. iTAPAS not only accelerates the solution convergence performance by improving the efficiency of the PAS identification and flow shift operations, but also simplifies the algorithm implementation by removing the PAS matching and branch shift steps. In this paper, detailed algorithmic procedures of TAPAS and iTAPAS are discussed. The numerical results from our implementation and comparison reveal that iTAPAS is nearly two times faster than TAPAS in solving large-scale networks. An in-depth interpretation of the comparison results is also subsequently followed by examining the PAS set information of both algorithms.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958064","","","algorithm theory;road traffic","traffic assignment problem;origin-based subnetworks;traffic assignment by paired alternative segments algorithm;improved TAPAS algorithm;iTAPAS;PAS identification method;flow shift operation;PAS matching;branch shift;algorithmic procedure;large-scale network","","3","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is known that weaving section of roundabout is the bottleneck of the traffic movement. Therefore, it should be given the highest priority in the capacity analysis. The current methods of estimating the approach capacity of a roundabout mainly utilize information of vehicles entering and exiting the roundabout. From literature review it has been found that few studies are conducted based on the traffic characteristics of weaving section in capacity estimation. The purpose of this research is to estimate the capacity of roundabout by modeling radius of roundabout, width of circulating roadway, and gap acceptance at the weaving sections. For this reason, a total of 21 roundabouts that are located at the metropolitan Beijing are selected to conduct data collection. Significance analysis of speed at weaving sections has been conducted by means of the variance analytic method. By taking geometric conditions and traffic conditions into account, new concepts of “Quasi-saturation state of roundabout” and “The Capacity of Roundabout” are introduced in this study. The regression models of the headway and the radius on both the outer lanes and the inner lanes are established respectively using Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS 18.0) for windows. Moreover, based on the theory of saturation flow rate, a new method is proposed to estimate the capacity of single-lane and multi-lane roundabouts using MATLAB software. And then the real data are taken to validate this model. The findings from this research demonstrate that capacity estimates with weaving section vehicles result in improved prediction of the actual capacity of a roundabout.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957955","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957955","roundabouts;weaving section;gap acceptance theory;capacity","Mathematical model;Weaving;Vehicles;Educational institutions;Analytical models;Equations;Correlation","road traffic;statistical analysis","capacity estimation;Beijing;traffic conflict;speed reduction;traffic movement bottleneck;roundabout capacity;weaving section;roundabout modeling radius;circulating roadway;gap acceptance;data collection;variance analytic method;roundabout quasisaturation state;statistical program for social sciences;SPSS 18.0;saturation flow;MATLAB software;single-lane roundabouts;multilane roundabouts","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first employ the differential excitation component of WOD to extract reliable road clue regions from a complex background, and then adopt the orientation component of WOD and our proposed line-voting scheme (LVS) to locate the vanishing point. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset reveal a step forward in detection performance against the state-of-the-art vanishing point detection methods.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957672","","Roads;Kernel;Histograms;Noise measurement;Vehicles;Accuracy;Detection algorithms","image denoising;image texture;natural scenes;object detection;roads;traffic engineering computing","complex scenes;local dominant texture orientation;natural road clues;background noises;vanishing point detection algorithm;Weber orientation descriptor;reliable road clue region extraction;complex background;line-voting scheme","","2","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Complex interdependencies arise in case the driver is integrated into the automation concept by shared vehicle control on maneuver level. Therefore, we introduce and evaluate different maneuver delegation strategies for multi-lane intersections and describe and quantify their consequences for the vehicle trajectory in a reference intersection scenario. Also, a novel trajectory back propagation approach is presented that allows the determination of fundamental reference points within the intersection that are needed for a comprehensive maneuver- and behavior planning approach that can also be used for fully automated vehicle concepts.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957886","","Vehicles;Trajectory;Automation;Planning;Turning;Acceleration;Roads","automobiles;backpropagation;road traffic","maneuver delegation;automated vehicles;multilane road intersections;complex environment;traffic density;maneuver density;complex interdependencies;automation concept;shared vehicle control;maneuver level;vehicle trajectory;reference intersection scenario;trajectory backpropagation approach;reference points;comprehensive maneuver-planning approach;comprehensive behavior planning approach","","3","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Abbas","NA; NA","17th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","","2014","","","3120","3125","This research effort describes a methodology to investigate the effects of personality and emotion on driver behavior. The methodology detailed in this paper has four main components: development of psychological personality surveys, development of psychological emotion surveys, physiological data collection, and development of simulator scenarios. There were three simulator scenarios used in this study: a base scenario, an anxiety scenario, and an anger scenario. The base scenario allowed the participants to interact without any pressure being applied to them. The anxiety scenario applied pressure to the participants through a time limit and police vehicles patrolling the roadway. The anger scenario applied pressure to the participants through aggressive actions by the surrounding traffic. The results show that there can be drastic differences in driver behavior in different emotional states. The tendencies are that drivers become more aggressive and show smaller headways when they are angered. The results also show that drivers have different emotional responses to the same stimuli.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958192","","Vehicles;Psychology;Data collection;Skin;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Physiology","behavioural sciences computing;psychology","psychophysiological driving simulator;driver behavior;psychological personality survey development;psychological emotion survey development;physiological data collection;simulator scenarios;base scenario;anxiety scenario;anger scenario;time limit;police vehicles;emotional states;emotional responses","","2","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two traffic flow analytical techniques are always employed in studying queuing processes: shockwave analysis and input-output analysis. These two techniques have been taken as separate tools for estimating queue length (size) in a number of studies. Shockwave analysis is particularly well-suited to evaluating the space occupied by the queuing process in units of length, e.g. metre, kilometre etc. Input-output analysis is always employed for vertical queue size in terms of the number of queued vehicles; however, some studies argued that this method underestimated queue size. This paper highlights the reason in the literature for underestimation of queue length with input-out analysis. The objective of this study was to compare real-time queue estimation accuracy using two proposed models based on the two analytical techniques, after investigating the dynamic characteristic of traffic flow at the bottleneck in the freeway. The parameters were determined using discrete field data collected along an urban freeway corridor, Whitemud Drive (WMD), in Edmonton, Canada. This study illustrated that although the two proposed models estimate queue length in different ways, they are compatible and capable of yielding accurate estimates of real-time queue length upstream of the studied bottleneck.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958120","Recurrent Bottleneck;Traffic Congestion;Queue Estimation","Queueing analysis;Estimation;Vehicles;Analytical models;Electric breakdown;Accuracy","queueing theory;road traffic","queue estimation;shockwave-based model;input-output-based model;traffic congestion;freeway bottleneck;traffic control strategy;traffic flow analytical techniques;queue length;queuing process;Whitemud Drive;Edmonton;Canada;freeway corridor","","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper made a deep research about the taxi's mobility pattern based on the data collected from taxis in Beijing. Unlike previous work, we took only the empty-running taxis' traces as our target and found that the mobility of empty taxis which are looking for passengers exhibited truncated Lévy flight behavior. The trip length distribution can be well fitted by an improved truncated power law and the scaling exponent is α = 1.4. The trip direction distributed uniformly under the street layout of Beijing, nearly being 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 in east, south, west and north. Besides, the distribution shows a strong correlation with the distribution of road segments direction in Beijing, and were deeply influenced by the population density as well.","2153-0009;2153-0017","978-1-4799-6078","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957706","Empty taxis;Mobility pattern;Lévy flight","Roads;Cities and towns;Sociology;Statistics;Vehicles;Animals;Trajectory","automobiles;behavioural sciences computing","passenger-searching taxi mobility pattern;taxi driver behavior;social phenomenon;traffic congestion;population mobility;data collection;Beijing;empty-running taxi traces;empty taxi mobility;truncated Lévy flight behavior;trip length distribution;truncated power law improvement;scaling exponent;uniformly distributed trip direction;street layout;road segment direction distribution;population density","","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
