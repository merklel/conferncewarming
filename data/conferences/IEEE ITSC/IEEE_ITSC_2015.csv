Every user group and their specific requirements have to be considered during planning and realization of public transportation services. Hence public transport operators have to ensure a barrier-free public transportation service. Certainly this barrier-freeness still is not realized for every user group, due to the high complexity of public transportation systems. Therefore this paper focuses on a comprehensive Systems Engineering-based approach to handle complexity for development of a new individual travel assistance and its integration into existing background systems of public transport operators.

Consequently, the complexity of collecting traffic data as well as the traffic coordination carried over a control center are exponential. An Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) nowadays becomes a solution for handling those complexities. ITSs were already considered in developed countries under different formations. However, they are rarely used in most developing countries because of the cost of developing, implementing and maintaining those systems. We are interested by the design of an adaptive ITS for crowded cities in developing countries where non-lane-based traffic is core. We develop a framework for two main goals: 1) Collecting and processing traffic data from various types of sources such as cameras, sensors, GPS on cars, buses, taxis, motorcycles, etc. or individual users via our Mobile Application, 2) Adapting several algorithms in transportation research to regulate the traffic and inform users via a control center.

Counting people inside the station is often easier than outside the building because the building is a closed system with well-defined cross-sections like doors or stairs instead of the open area outside. The question is, given a set of people counters inside an infrastructure, how to determine the pedestrian inflow into the building. The inflow may be higher than the people counts inside the station because bottlenecks limit the maximum rate of people entering the infrastructure. We present a real-time estimation model which uses people counts inside a metro station and extrapolates the expected inflow once the counting sensors saturate. The model is validated with a case study at a large subway station next to Vienna's largest football stadium.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313409","pedestrians;crowd;flow estimation;data analysis","Estimation;Public transportation;Data models;Buildings;Adaptation models;Real-time systems;Radiation detectors","estimation theory;intelligent transportation systems;pedestrians;public transport;real-time systems","pedestrian inflow rates;saturated sensor counting data;complex metro station;ITS applications;public transport stations;closed system;real-time estimation model","","1","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Managing Security in Intelligent Transport Systems","U. Lang; R. Schreiner","NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","48","53","This paper describes an innovative security architecture for managing security in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), based on our research carried out as part of the still-ongoing ICSI (""Intelligent cooperative Sensing for Improved Traffic Efficiency"") EU 7th Framework Programme (FP7) funded research project. We first present an overview of the security requirements to enforce in ICSI: The protection of the ICSI system itself, the protection of application data and, last, but not least, user privacy. The core of our work is two key technical aspects, which are the base for a successful enforcement of appropriate security policies, including privacy: Firstly, our work in advanced access control (proximity-based, redaction/filtering-based, and attribute-based) forms the basis for user privacy protection in ICSI, because here standard access control models like Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) are not sufficient. At this time of writing, two first prototypes are implemented. We also briefly evaluated European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Machine-to-Machine (M2M) security, with not very promising results, especially the access control part is insufficient for ICSI, and does not meet the requirements of privacy protection. Secondly, our security architecture and implementation for the Object Management Group's (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS), and secondly, advanced access control. The DDS security architecture and implementation, which is available as prototype enforcing security policies based on topics, publishers and subscribers, is the base for infrastructure protection of the ICSI Data Distribution Platform (DDP). Our prototype implementation is based on the upcoming OMG security standards and leverages ObjectSecurity's OpenPMF (""Open Policy Management Framework) functionality for policy definition and management, and for logging. In addition, we describe a draft of the overall ICSI security architecture. It integrates ETSI M2M security, DDS security and the ""model-driven security"" based OpenPMF Policy Management Framework.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313108","intelligent transport;security;access control;policy;DDS;OpenPMF;model-driven security","Conferences;Intelligent transportation systems","authorisation;data privacy;intelligent transportation systems","security management;intelligent transport systems;intelligent cooperative sensing for improved traffic efficiency;security requirements;application data protection;proximity-based access control;redaction-based access control;filtering-based access control;attribute-based access control;user privacy protection;machine-to-machine security;data distribution service;advanced access control;DDS security architecture;security policies;infrastructure protection;ICSI data distribution platform;DDP;OMG security standards;ObjectSecurity's OpenPMF;open policy management framework functionality;policy definition;ICSI security architecture;ETSI M2M security;model-driven security;OpenPMF policy management framework","","1","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of hard problems is to get high quality images. Indeed, with low quality images, many visual based methods may become invalid due to the missing of feature information required for object tracking. To address this sort of issue, laser range finder (LRF) measurements and raw pixel information based method is proposed in this paper. Given an object, it makes use of raw pixel information to locate interesting small region firstly. This region is then mapped into LRF space in which the region is grown to a complete region covering most part of the target through a bidirectional growth strategy.

"A Benchmark Analysis of Open Source Transportation-Electrification Simulation Tools","D. F. Allan; A. M. Farid","NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1202","1208","Electrified transportation has emerged as a trend to support energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction targets. Electric (road) vehicles are one of the main features associated with transportation electrification. They aim to reduce the use of non-renewable vehicle's fuel resources (Petrol, Diesel, etc.) and depend on renewable energy. However, EVs interact with three interconnected systems: the transportation system, the electric power grid, and their supporting information systems often called intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Therefore, the true success of electric vehicles depends on their successful integration with the infrastructure systems that support them. Consequently, transportation electrification as a new trend requires simulation tools that are capable of building-up schemes close to real life scenarios. This paper presents a benchmark analysis of open source transportation electrification simulation tools. The holistic assessment consists of a 2 level analysis. First, a list of available traffic simulation tools open source and commercial is classified into macro, meso and microscopic simulators. Second, an in-depth comparison analysis is conducted for only micro &amp; mesoscopic open source tools. This analysis aims to depict the overall features of these tools such as inclusion of electric vehicle functionality, source-code accessibility &amp; customizability and simulation performance. The study finds that while none of these tools has truly addressed the breadth of transportation electrification research, MATSIM, SUMO and TRANSIMS all have promising characteristics for future development.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313290","Transportation Electrification;Electric Vehicles;Traffic Simulation Tools;Agent-Based Simulation;Microscopic","Analytical models;Benchmark testing;Load modeling;Roads;Electric vehicles","digital simulation;electric vehicles;intelligent transportation systems;power engineering computing;power system interconnection;public domain software;road vehicles;smart power grids;traffic engineering computing","open source transportation-electrification simulation tool;electric road vehicle;interconnected system;electric power grid;intelligent transportation system;ITS;MATSIM;SUMO;TRANSIMS","","4","","56","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An important module in ALPR systems is image classification that includes training classifiers for character recognition, commonly employed after detecting a license plate in a license plate image and segmenting out the characters from the localized plate region. A classifier is trained for each character in a one-vs-all fashion using segmented character samples collected from the actual camera capture site, where the collected samples are manually labeled by an operator. The substantial time and effort required for manual annotation of training images can result in excessive operational cost and overhead. In this paper, we propose a new method to minimize manual annotation required for training classifiers in an ALPR system. Instead of collecting training images from the actual camera capture site, our method utilizes either artificially generated synthetic license plate images or character samples acquired by trained ALPR systems already operating in other sites. The performance gap due to differences between training and target domain distributions is minimized using an unsupervised domain adaptation. The efficiency of the proposed method is shown on artificially generated and actual character samples collected from CA and NY.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313336","license plate recognition;synthetic plate generation;domain adaptation","Licenses;Training;Optical character recognition software;Dictionaries;Cameras;Image segmentation;Distortion","feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;intelligent transportation systems","automated license plate recognition;ALPR system;transportation imaging;image classification;license plate detection;image segmentation;manual annotation minimization","","3","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To benefit from such data, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) need data storage that can handle the massive volume of data and support high-computational spatio-temporal queries. Although key-value store databases efficiently handle large-scale data, they are not equipped with effective functions for supporting spatio-temporal data. To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight, but powerful, spatio-temporal index structure based on key-value store databases. We adopted STCode, a longitude, latitude, and time-encoding algorithm, to build an index on top of HBase, a standard key-value store database. Our proposed index structure allows continuous updates of objects and provides an efficient prefix filter for supporting spatio-temporal data retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the high performance of spatio-temporal queries with response time meeting the requirements of real-time query-processing systems.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313531","key-value store database;HBase;STCode;spatiotemporal index;real-time processing","Indexes;Time factors;Servers;Real-time systems;Spatial databases;Roads","automobiles;database indexing;intelligent transportation systems;query processing;temporal databases;visual databases","scalable spatio-temporal data storage;intelligent transportation systems;HBase;GPS-enabled devices;probe cars;traffic sensors;smart phones;ITS;high-computational spatio-temporal queries;key-value store databases;large-scale data handling;spatio-temporal index structure;STCode;time-encoding algorithm;prefix filter;spatio-temporal data retrieval;real-time query-processing systems","","1","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system is a real-time weather responsive system that accesses weather information that provides near-real-time atmospheric and pavement observation data that is used to adapt traffic signal timing to increase safety. Since the system controls part of a safety critical application survivability and resilience considerations must be an integral part of the system architecture. In order to provide adaptation to system behavior as the result of faults or malicious acts an architecture is presented that monitors itself and adapts its behavior in real-time.

The theory of certifying executions is extended by three concepts: the detection of dependency violations, exceptions triggers, and sensor analysis are considered, a dual-bound threshold approach for detecting off-nominal executions is introduced, profiling is augmented with the concept of behavior sets.

Smith","NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","831","835","We show how an in-vehicle algorithm that alerts drivers to pedestrians can be defined using an empirical approach that quantifies the relative level with which drivers are likely to accept alerts to pedestrians. The approach was used in two studies to investigate a range of contextual factors known to influence driver ratings of alerts for pedestrians issued by a driver-assistance system. Regression analysis shows that four factors consisting of combinations of pedestrian location and motion relative to the road ahead of the vehicle explain over 80% of the variability in drivers' ratings of alerts. This finding suggests that four contextual factors largely define the perceptual cues that drivers use to rate alerts to pedestrians. The work demonstrates the utility of subjective driver responses to FOT events as a tool to inform the development of pedestrian alerting criteria.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313232","Intelligent vehicle systems;Vulnerable Road Users safety;Modeling Alerts to Vulnerable Road Users;Vehicle automation","Vehicles;Roads;Legged locomotion;Predictive models;Context;Safety;Context modeling","driver information systems;regression analysis","modeling ratings;in-vehicle alerts;naturalistic situations;empirical approach;driver-assistance system;regression analysis;subjective driver responses;FOT events;pedestrian alerting criteria","","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a new novel and robust approach for the detection and location of crosswalks, which is based on Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) and extended Random Sample Consensus (ERANSAC). Specially, first, the method with temporal median of background extraction is applied to traffic monitoring videos so that the foreground has a less disturbance for crosswalks detection and location. Second, we use a method of MSER to extract crosswalk features in the image. Last, we invent the ERANSAC to pick out crosswalk features extracted by MSER to detect and locate crosswalk and indicate the position of crosswalk in the image. Compared to the existing detection methods, the proposed method based on MSER can efficiently extract crosswalk regions under various illumination conditions, which can avoid the selection of thresholds according to the current environment situation and greatly improve the system flexibility and robustness. The ERANSAC can determine the distance between candidate samples and get the principle components by the way of eliminating the non-crosswalk regions. Promising experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method has a high detection rate at extremely false alarm and is robust to the different crosswalk angle and various illuminations.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313537","crosswalks detection;MSER;ERANSAC;Intelligent Transportation System","Feature extraction;Yttrium;Monitoring;Videos;Cameras;Lighting;Fitting","feature extraction;intelligent transportation systems;iterative methods","crosswalk detection;maximally stable extremal regions;MSER;extended random sample consensus;ERANSAC;intelligent transportation management system;ITMS;crosswalk feature extraction","","4","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By means of Content-based recommendation technology and k-Nearest Neighbor method in Recommendation Systems, we first find the similar traffic conditions according to the characteristics of traffic conditions. Then the matching degree between current traffic conditions and various timing plans can be predicted by analyzing the history data of selected similar traffic conditions.

To make the position estimates consistent it is necessary to understand the noise distribution of the information used in the estimation algorithm. For GNSS position information the noise distribution is commonly approximated as zero mean with Gaussian distribution, with the standard deviation used as an algorithm tuning parameter. A major issue with satellite based positioning is the well known problem of multipath which can introduce a non-linear and non-Gaussian error distribution for the position estimate. This paper introduces a novel algorithm that compares the noise distribution of the GNSS information with the more consistent noise distribution of the local egocentric sensors to effectively reject GNSS data that is inconsistent. The results presented in this paper show how the gating of the GNSS information in a strong multipath environment can maintain consistency in the position filter and dramatically improve the position estimate. This is particularly important when sharing information from different vehicles as in the case of cooperative perception due to the requirement to align information from various sources.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313495","","Global Positioning System;Satellites;Sensors;Noise;Logic gates;Vehicles;Uncertainty","filtering theory;Gaussian distribution;Global Positioning System;intelligent transportation systems","GNSS consistency;GPS consistency;intelligent transportation system;satellite based positioning;noise distribution;Gaussian distribution;nonGaussian error distribution;strong multipath environment;position filter","","3","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To avoid traffic jam, drivers tend to use intelligent traffic-aware route planning service to help them save travel time. While the existing traffic-aware systems independently compute the fastest route based on the current and/or historical traffic condition, they ignore the fact that the uncoordinated decision based on the identical traffic view could lead to new congestion in the future. We propose a novel online route planning system called Predictive Traffic Assignment or PTA that exploits previous planned routes to accurately predict their impact on future traffic. Based on the dynamic prediction, PTA system computes the optimal route for each vehicle. Because it accounts for the impact of the previous vehicles, PTA coordinately assigns different routes to vehicles such that the traffic load is balanced among these routes. We present the models of PTA and implement PTA with an efficient algorithm. We conducted extensive simulation studies based on actual city maps. Simulations show that PTA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art online and offline approaches.

Several scenarios on a realistic simulated network are used to illustrate changes in performance when detector inputs are inaccurate and generate discrepancies in the estimation of link demands. Then, these results are compared to the network with accurate detection but a reduced number of sensors. Equivalent system performance from comprehensive sensor coverage but with inaccuracies and reduced number of sensors with increased accuracy can be found. This approach is proposed to be used for detection design, where tradeoffs between performance and coverage are taken into account. Results from different patterns of sensor inaccuracies are also discussed, providing insights on patterns that may have less impact than others.

In this paper, we demonstrate how a distributed AVL system can be designed on the basis of Connected Vehicle (CV) technology, i.e. information about bus location is exchanged in the PT network via buses equipped with the technology.

One challenge is the understanding of complex situations and behavior generation within these especially in urban areas. Trajectory planning in these scenarios can be complex and expensive. Semantic scene modeling and planning can provide vital information to generate reliable and safe trajectories for automated vehicles. In this work we present a novel approach for high-level maneuver planning. It is based on a semantic state space that describes possible actions of a vehicle with respect to other scene elements like lane segments and traffic participants. The semantic characteristic of this state space allow for generalized planning even in complex situations. Concepts like heuristics and homotopies are utilized to optimize planning. Therefore, it is possible to efficiently generate high-level maneuver sequences for automated driving.

A global Monte Carlo K-test indicates that the incident-topic tweets are significantly clustered at different scales up to 600m.

Under this regime, the present work details an event-triggering technique (ETT) for efficient and effective tracking of road vehicles in the realm of intelligent transportation systems. The technique assumes that both the local and remote host follow a predetermined mobility model to approximate the actual vehicle location. Upon detection of deviation from this model, the local host triggers an update event to resynchronize the remote host. Within the proposed ETT, both the mobility model, as well as the detection thresholds are calculated solely based on sensory data, making the whole system both scalable and robust to dynamic changes.

Intersections are one of the major bottlenecks that contribute to urban traffic congestion. Traditional traffic control methods, such as traffic signal and stop sign control are not optimal for all demand levels as demonstrated in the literature. Recently, numerous research efforts proposed Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications to enhance intersection capacity and hence reduce congestion. In this paper we propose a game-theory-based algorithm for controlling autonomous vehicle movements equipped with Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems at uncontrolled intersections. The goal of this research effort is to develop an algorithm capable of using the future autonomous/automated vehicle capabilities to replace the usual state-of-the-practice control systems at intersections (e.g. stop signs, traffic signals, etc.). The proposed algorithm is chicken-game inspired and is efficient for application in real-time. It assumes vehicles can communicate with a central agent at the intersection to provide their instantaneous speeds and locations. The proposed algorithm assumes that vehicles obey the Nash equilibrium solution of the game. The simulation results demonstrated reductions in vehicle travel time and delay relative to an all-way stop sign control in the range of 49 and 89 percent on average respectively.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.65","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313157","traffic management;uncontrolled intersections;ITS;connected vehicles;CACC","Vehicles;Games;Acceleration;Delays;Algorithm design and analysis;Game theory;Mobile robots","adaptive control;delays;game theory;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic control;road vehicles","intersection game-theory;traffic control algorithm;connected vehicle environment;urban traffic congestion;intelligent transportation system;ITS;cooperative adaptive cruise control;CACC system;vehicle travel time;vehicle delay","","19","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lack of road infrastructure, inadequate rail system and uncoordinated transport and urban planning can be found frequently in developing large cities. Traffic lights are inevitable control method of cities and supposably, this will not change even if the cities grow further or technology improve. However, if the traffic signals are not correctly operated the municipalities produce neither economically nor environmentally solutions (i.e. replacement of signalized intersections with multistory interchanges).

Kern","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2707","2714","This paper presents an approach for matching cell phone trajectories of low spatial and temporal accuracy to the underlying road network. In this setting, only the position of the base station involved in a signaling event and the timestamp are known, resulting in a possible error of several kilometers. No additional information, such as signal strength, is available. The proposed solution restricts the set of admissible routes to a corridor by estimating the area within which a user is allowed to travel. The size and shape of this corridor can be controlled by various parameters to suit different requirements. The computed area is then used to select road segments from an underlying road network, for instance OpenStreetMap. These segments are assembled into a search graph, which additionally takes the chronological order of observations into account. A modified Dijkstra algorithm is applied for finding admissible candidate routes, from which the best one is chosen. We performed a detailed evaluation of 2249 trajectories with an average sampling time of 260 seconds. Our results show that, in urban areas, on average more than 44% of each trajectory are matched correctly. In rural and mixed areas, this value increases to more than 55%. Moreover, an in-depth evaluation was carried out to determine the optimal values for the tunable parameters and their effects on the accuracy, matching ratio and execution time.

Firstly, the classic Euclidean distance metric based models for traffic flow prediction that treat each feature with equal weight is not effective in multi-source high-dimension feature space. Secondly, traditional handcrafting feature engineering by experts is tedious and error-prone. Thirdly, the traffic conditions in real-life situation are too complex to measure with only one distance metric. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-metric based k-nearest neighbor method (HMMKNN) for traffic flow prediction which can seize the intrinsic features in data and reduce the semantic gap between domain knowledge and handcrafted feature engineering. Experimental results demonstrate multi-source data fusion helps to improve the performance of traffic parameter prediction and HMMKNN outperforms the traditional Euclidean-based k-NN under various configurations. Furthermore, visualization of feature transformation clustering results implies the learned metrics are more reasonable.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313457","","Hidden Markov models;Measurement;Predictive models;Data integration;Roads;Vehicles","data acquisition;intelligent transportation systems;regression analysis","Euclidean-based k-NN;multisource data fusion;handcrafted feature engineering;HMMKNN;multisource high-dimension feature space;Euclidean distance metric-based model;nonlinear complex system;modern data collection technology;traffic flow prediction;ITS;intelligent transportation system;hybrid multimetric k-nearest neighbor regression","","2","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this purpose, a dataset consisting of more than 40,000 tweets in south and west part of the Sydney metropolitan area is utilized. After a data processing effort, the tweets are clustered into seven main categories using text mining techniques, where each category represents a type of activity including shopping, recreation, and work.

Beside activity type, temporal and spatial distributions of activities are used in the classification exercise. Categories are mapped to the identified regions within the city of Sydney across four time slots (two peak periods and two off-peak periods).

This paper applies a simulation approach to the optimized design of cross-border operations within the context of end-to-end trade corridor management. The high levels of inefficiency that currently characterize most African border posts is presented as use case, long cross-border delays are shown to result from conflicting objective of different stakeholders and lack of integration between the systems and processes of independent participants. The results of empirical studies were used to identify the most important contributing factors to cross-border delays. A state flow diagram that represents the critical cross-border processes was constructed to capture the logical interactions between participants, systems and processes. This was converted into a Simio-based discrete process simulator that accurately describes the reality of typical African cross-border processes. The simulator was applied to determine the beneficial impact of various potential remedies to cross-border inefficiencies, including the use of RFID to support a Green Lanes concept and the interchange of information to allow the dynamic scheduling of customs processing capacity. The results of the simulations show that cross-border delays can be reduced by more than 80% through the implementation of a combination of the proposed system and operational changes.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313324","cross-border processes;trade corridors;auto-ID;customs risk engine;green customs lanes","Vehicles;Delays;Object oriented modeling;Data models;Radiofrequency identification;Biological system modeling;Inspection","digital simulation;intelligent transportation systems;logistics;optimisation;radiofrequency identification;scheduling;traffic engineering computing","transport operation simulation;traffic flow optimization;logistics operation optimization;cross-border operation;end-to-end trade corridor management;Simio-based discrete process simulator;RFID;dynamic scheduling;intelligent transportation system;ITS","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traffic density is a key traffic variable that can be used to characterize the traffic system and can be a valuable input to the functional areas of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, measurement of density in the field is difficult due to several practical limitations. This creates a need for inferring density from other traffic variables that are easily measurable in the field. In this paper, model based approaches for the estimation of traffic density are discussed. The non-linear model equations are based on the conservation principle and the fundamental traffic flow. The technique used for recursive estimation of density in real time plays a key role in terms of estimation accuracy. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a common tool for recursive estimation for nonlinear systems. This study investigates the application of particle filter (PF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) as alternatives to (EKF) for non-linear traffic state estimation in the context of traffic conditions in India. The estimated density values were corroborated using manually extracted field density values. The performance of these methods was also compared with a base model, where the fundamental traffic flow equation was used for calculating density. The convergence properties of these filters were also analyzed.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313328","","Mathematical model;Estimation;Kalman filters;Vehicles;Roads;Accuracy;Data models","intelligent transportation systems;Kalman filters;nonlinear equations;nonlinear filters;particle filtering (numerical methods);recursive estimation;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","Indian urban traffic scenario;urban traffic management;traffic density recursive estimation;intelligent transportation systems;ITS;nonlinear model equations;extended Kalman filter;EKF;particle filter;unscented Kalman filter;UKF;nonlinear traffic state estimation","","3","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is even more critical for large-scale networks with millions of vehicles. This paper investigates the speedup of DTA simulation models, using compiler optimizations and parallelism. DynusT as a widely used DTA model was evaluated as a test case, while its results could be generalized because we have used real-networks and calibrated them using real data sets in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). Extensive testing is performed to evaluate various dimensions for speed-up including: network size, number of processors, various optimization levels and operating systems. The performance results show that compiler optimizations and parallelism allow to: 1) double the speed required for a 4-hour simulation after 12 iterations to reach equilibrium, and 2) bring down the initial simulation time (required for network loading) by 2.5 times, enabling the testing of various real-time ITS applications.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.86","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313178","","Vehicles;Program processors;Optimization;Computational modeling;Load modeling;Parallel processing;Vehicle dynamics","digital simulation;intelligent transportation systems;optimisation;parallel processing;program compilers","DTA simulation model;real-time dynamic traffic simulation;intelligent transportation system;ITS;compiler optimization;parallelism","","2","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Real-Time Estimation of Drivers' Behaviour","J. Monteil; N. OHara; V. Cahill; M. Bouroche","NA; NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2046","2052","The increasing market penetration of in-vehicle sensor technology, e.g., cameras and lidars, is likely to provide more and more insights on drivers' behaviours. Real time knowledge of drivers' behaviour can be useful to a wide range of applications, such as driving assistance in traffic situations identified as critical, detection of tiredness levels or identification of drivers for insurance purposes. In situations where drivers only interact with other vehicles, for instance on highways, the drivers' behaviours can be modelled through microscopic car-following models. Those models are known to be able to capture the physical features of traffic flow, while accurately describing specific drivers' behaviour via behavioural parameters. A lot of research to date has focused on fitting the parameters of these models to real trajectory datasets using off-line techniques, with the objective to reproduce drivers variability in simulation. However very little has been published on online parameter estimation of car-following models. This paper investigates how in-vehicle sensors could help estimate car-following behavioural parameters. The focus is on the Intelligent Driver Model. A discussion of the sensitivity of the estimation is provided in light of previous work, and it is argued that, depending on the traffic state, not all the parameters need to be calibrated. An extended Kalman filter with physical inequality constraints on the behavioural parameters is then formulated for the class of time continuous car-following models. The filter exhibits systematic convergence for real trajectories of leaders and synthetic-simulated-trajectories of followers, for randomly picked parameters within the physical bounds, and for fixed and dynamic observation time steps ranging from 0.1 s up to 1 s. This demonstrates that online parameter estimation of behavioural parameters has great potential.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313423","","Intelligent vehciles;Parameter estimation;Trajectory;Behavioral science;Sensors;Real-time systems;Kalman filters;Vehicle driving","intelligent transportation systems;Kalman filters;modelling;nonlinear filters;parameter estimation;road traffic","driver behaviour modelling;online parameter estimation;highway;car-following model;traffic flow;intelligent driver model;extended Kalman filter","","7","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior research has focused on centralized cloud-based ""Big Data"" architectures for collecting, collating and analyzing the data. However, most of these scenarios accumulate thousands of petabytes in a short period of time, increasing the demand for more storage, and also slowing down speed of data analysis. Hence for real-time scenarios, e.g., agricultural crop tracking, traffic management, etc., such an approach would be impractical. Moreover, depending on the context in which the data is generated and is to be used, only a fraction of the data would be needed for analysis. Therefore, the challenges are to determine which data to keep and which to discard for both short term and long term usage, and define the contextual parameters along which this filtering is to be done. Hence one key problem addressed in this paper is how to define what data the user needs so that filtering algorithms can be defined to extract the data needed. To that end, in this paper, we present a goal driven, context-aware data filtering, transforming and integration approach for IoT-based systems. We propose a data warehouse-based data model for specifying the data needed at particular levels of granularity and frequency, that drive data storage and representation (aligned with the Semantic Sensor Network ontology).

A critical research topic for PHEVs is designing an efficient energy management system (EMS), in particular, determining how the energy flows in a hybrid powertrain should be managed in response to a variety of system parameters. Most of the existing systems either rely on a priori knowledge of future driving conditions to achieve the optimal but not real-time solution (e.g. Dynamic Programming strategy), or only upon the current driving situation to achieve a real-time but not optimal solution (e.g. rule-based strategy). Towards this end, we propose a Q-Learning based blended real-time EMS for PHEVs to address the trade-off between real-time performance and optimality. The proposed EMS can optimize the fuel consumption while learning the system's characteristics in real time. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed EMS can achieve a near optimal solution with 11.93% fuel savings compared to a binary mode control strategy, but a 2.86% fuel consumption increase compared to an off-line Dynamic Programming strategy.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313259","","Energy management;Ice;Power demand;Fuels;Real-time systems;Mathematical model","dynamic programming;energy management systems;hybrid electric vehicles;intelligent transportation systems;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);power transmission (mechanical)","energy management strategy;EMS;plug-in hybrid electric vehicle;PHEV;hybrid powertrain;dynamic programming strategy;rule-based strategy;Q-learning;fuel consumption optimization","","7","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The methodology is based on the concept of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) integrated with an adaptive optimization technique. The heterogeneous transportation network is first partitioned into a number of regions with homogeneous traffic conditions and well-defined MFDs. A macroscopic MFD-based model is used to describe the traffic dynamics of the resulting multi-region transportation system. A multivariable proportional integral (PI) feedback regulator is implemented to control the nonlinear system in real-time. The control variables consist of the inter-transferring flows between neighbourhood regions and the actuators correspond to the traffic lights of these areas (e.g. boundaries between regions). The recently proposed Adaptive Fine-Tuning (AFT) algorithm is used to optimize the gain matrices as well as the vector with the set-points of the PI controller. AFT is an iterative adaptive algorithm that optimizes the values of the tuneable parameters of the controller (e.g. gains and set-points) based on measurements of a performance index (e.g. total delay) for different perturbations of the parameters.

The ITT allows distributed (e.g. over Internet) interoperability testing starting from the network Transport Layer and all the way up to the Application Layer, e.g. to platooning. ITT clients can be implemented as Hardware-in-the-Loop, thus allowing to combine physical and virtual vehicles. Since the ITT considers each client as a black box, manufacturers can test together without revealing internal implementations to each other. The architecture of the ITT allows users to easily switch between physical wireless networking and virtual ITT networking.

The goal is to have the minimum number of vehicles caught in the dilemma zone and reduce red light runners while maximizing the green light period. In order to determine how well dilemma zone protection systems perform, we need to measure the frequency of red light runners. This frequency is closely correlated with crashes, but is difficult to collect. Recent algorithms utilize radar for dilemma zone protection. However, verification of the number of red light runners requires additional video detection.

"Vehicle-Infrastructure Localization Based on the SME Filter","F. Zhang; G. Hinz; D. Clarke; A. Knoll","NA; NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","225","230","Precise and accurate localization is important for safe autonomous driving. Given a traffic scenario with multiple vehicles equipped with proprioceptive sensors for self-localization and infrastructure equipped with exteroceptive sensors for car detection, vehicle-infrastructure communication can be used to improve the localization. However as the number of vehicles in a scenario increases, data association becomes increasingly challenging. We propose a solution utilizing the symmetric measurement equation filter (SME) for cooperative localization to address data association issues, as it does not require an enumeration of measurement-to-target associations. The key idea is to define a symmetric transformation which maps position measurements to a homogeneous function, thereby effectively addressing several challenges in vehicle-infrastructure scenarios such as bandwidth limitations, data association challenges and especially the configuration of the exteroceptive sensor.

Two novel ITS facilities layer protocols for platooning are proposed: Minimal and Full Platooning protocols. Standardising such protocols enable vehicles from different OEMs to have a common communication strategy for platooning. The proposed protocols are compared with the current facilities layer protocols: CAM and DENM. Deficiencies of these with respect to platooning are discussed. A discussion on message update rate is also given. Results from a demonstration of platooning with the Minimal protocol compared to CAM/DENM are presented.

The purpose of TSA routing is to reduce the travel time by choosing a route that is possibly longer than the shortest one but has less red lights. Whereas GLOSA and RLDA are quite easy to implement from a scientific point of view, TSA routing presents a certain challenge: first of all, TSA routing necessitates predictions on future signal states on a wider look in the future than GLOSA and RLDA, a possible reason why this field of research still seems rather unexplored. Second, there are still many unresolved issues, such as the inadequacy of graphs for TSA-routing, or proper traffic load estimations. In this paper, we present a fully functioning model for TSA routing on the basis of our forgoing research on the prediction of future signal states and address the question of practical usability by evaluating our model under realistic conditions. We analyze, among other things, the impact of partial knowledge on traffic light's future signal states and the impact of different traffic loads on TSA routes by means of a test field in Munich, Germany. We describe necessary modifications of the underlying transportation network's graph structure and shortest path routing algorithm to allow routing under consideration of future signal states of traffic lights. We show that, albeit there are many erratic aspects in traffic and signal states, TSA routing still reaches a significant travel time gain over usual routing in our test field.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.81","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313173","","Routing;Timing;Estimation;Predictive models;Vehicles;Standards;Stochastic processes","driver information systems;estimation theory;graph theory;intelligent transportation systems;vehicle routing","traffic signal adaptive routing;signal phase and timing information;SPaT;driving assistance function;green light optimal speed control;GLOSA;red light duration advisory;RLDA;TSA routing;travel time;traffic load estimation;realistic condition;traffic light future signal state;TSA route;transportation network graph structure;shortest path routing algorithm;erratic aspect","","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we examine the accuracy of popular travel time calculation techniques, that use historical, instantaneous and predictive data to calculate travel time. A dynamic time calculation technique that accounts for time varying road speeds is used and the driver is considered to experience changes in the traffic pattern as the journey progresses.

We calculate the travel times for trips on major routes based on these techniques and compare them with the true average travel time on the particular route.

The current generation environment perception sensors used for automotive sensor fusion are capable of providing estimated kinematic and as well as non-kinematic information on the observed targets. This paper focuses on integrating the kinematic and non-kinematic information in a track-to-track association (T2TA) procedure. A scalable framework called Combi-Tor is introduced here that is designed to calculate the association decision using likelihood ratio tests based on the available kinematic and non-kinematic information on the targets, which are tracked and classified by different sensors. The calculation of the association decision includes the uncertainty in the sensor's local tracking and classification modules. The required sufficient statistical derivations are discussed.

However, the typical detection method of TSP contains two steps: Check-in and Check-out. A new mechanism of multi-step detection (Advance call 1, Confirmation, advance call 2, and Check-out) to expand the signal timing adjustment scope for near-side bus stops is presented. Four models with multi-step detection are employed: No TSP, TSP, TSP with Phase Rotation (PR), and Custom TSP.

The approach is based on the realistic assumption that the average speed of conventional vehicles is roughly equal to the average speed of connected vehicles, and consequently, it can be obtained at the (local or central) traffic monitoring and control unit from connected vehicles' reports. Thus, complete traffic state estimation (for arbitrarily selected segments in the network) may be achieved by estimating the total density of vehicles. Recasting the dynamics of the total density of vehicles, which are described by the well-known conservation law equation, as a linear time-varying system, we employ a Kalman filter for the estimation of the total density. We demonstrate the fact that the developed approach allows a variety of different measurement configurations, by also considering the case in which additional mainstream total flow measurements are employed to replace a corresponding number of total flow measurements at on-ramps or off-ramps. We validate the performance of the developed estimation scheme through simulations using a well-known second-order traffic flow model as ground truth for the traffic state.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313543","","Road transportation;Vehicles;Estimation;Connected vehicles;Kalman filters;Mathematical model;Density measurement","intelligent transportation systems;Kalman filters;monitoring;road vehicles;state estimation;velocity measurement","highway traffic state estimation;mixed connected;conventional vehicles;macroscopic model-based approach;mixed traffic;average speed measurements;spot sensor-based total flow measurements;traffic monitoring;conservation law equation;Kalman filter","","5","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Localization benefits from multiple observations of the same location at different times as these may provide important information on static and mobile objects. For efficient mapping, the environment may be explored in parallel. For these purposes, multiple observations represented by grid maps have to be aligned into one mutual frame. This paper addresses the problem of group-wise grid map registration using an image processing approach. For registration, a rotational-invariant descriptor is proposed in order to provide the correspondences of points of interest in radar-based occupancy grid maps. As pairwise registration of multiple grid maps suffers from bias, this paper proposes a graph-based approach for robust registration of multiple grid maps. This will facilitate highly accurate range sensor maps for the aforementioned purposes.

The stripping ratio is measured by image processing technique such as comparison between the pixels of white lines of the road image and the theoretical image that we generate. The road images are continuously synthesized with projection transform from road images taken by an in-vehicle camera and CAN (Controller Area Network) data logged when the vehicle is being driven. The theoretical images are automatically generated by seeking pixels where lane markings should be placed in the synthesis image. The Stripping ratio and the synthesized road images are managed by GIS (Geographic Information System). It is useful to survey the stripping ratio distribution for repainting.

This paper presents a high-level data fusion based probabilistic situation assessment method which is capable of assessing a current traffic situation and giving a recommendation about driving behaviors. The proposed method consists of two steps: high-level data fusion and probabilistic situation assessment. The high-level data fusion, designed to provide a better understating of observed situations, produces a local dynamic road map by integrating all dynamic entities with a high-precision static road map. The probabilistic situation assessment estimates threat levels of each lane as the probability of the lane state through the use of independent local experts based on the local dynamic road map. The recommendations for behavior decision are determined by filtering out noises resulting from object tracking even though a tracking module misses objects or detects wrong objects a lot, but immediately. The method is implemented in an open-source robot operating system to provide a reusable and hardware independent software platform, and verified and evaluated through in-vehicle tests on real highways in real-time operation.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313351","","Vehicles;Roads;Vehicle dynamics;Data integration;Probabilistic logic;Sensors;Safety","automobiles;filtering theory;intelligent transportation systems;mobile robots;object tracking;probability;public domain software;road traffic;sensor fusion;SLAM (robots)","high-level data fusion;highly automated driving system;probabilistic situation assessment method;traffic situation;driving behavior;observed situation understating;local dynamic road map;high-precision static road map;lane threat level estimation;lane state probability;behavior decision;noise filtering;object tracking;tracking module;object miss;object detection;open-source robot operating system;reusable hardware independent software platform;in-vehicle test;highway;real-time operation;self-driving car","","9","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the detection of semantic information problem, Texton and Dispton maps are used as a source to model a probabilistic joint boosting classifier. The evidential grids are based on occupancy grids, an approach based on the Dempster-Shafer theory that manages different sources of uncertainty arising in dynamic temporal scenes. An additional structure is created to handle a refined set of propositions originated from the meta-knowledge available.

"Static Occlusion Detection and Handling in Transportation Videos","M. Shreve; E. A. Bernal; Q. Li; R. P. Loce","NA; NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","638","643","Occlusions present a challenge in surveillance and traffic monitoring applications where person and/or vehicle tracking are required. Video-based object tracking is a process where the location of a given object of interest in a video sequence is determined across a range of frames. A key step in typical tracking operations is forming a feature representation of an object being tracked and solving a correspondence problem to find the location of the best-matching set of those features between video frames. The best-matching feature set is usually found via optimization algorithms across regions in subsequent frames near and around the location of the object in a current frame. The features used to solve the correspondence problem are usually appearance-based, and may include color, texture and shape descriptors. Consequently, the track can be lost when a view of the tracked object is occluded by objects in the scene because the appearance of the occluded object may not sufficiently resemble the appearance of the unoccluded object. In this paper, we present a method for determining the location of static occlusions in a scene at the pixel level, and utilize the knowledge of the location of the occlusions to boost the performance of well-known video-based object tracking algorithms. We demonstrate via experimental testing that the proposed method is effective in improving the performance of tracking algorithms, particularly when the motion in the scene is highly regularized, as is the case in cameras performing transportation monitoring tasks.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313202","","Object tracking;Arrays;Automobiles;Videos","object tracking;optimisation;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;video surveillance","static occlusion detection;transportation videos;surveillance;traffic monitoring applications;vehicle tracking;video-based object tracking;best-matching feature set;optimization algorithms;transportation monitoring tasks","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To detect indicator lights from a vehicle, a symmetrical descriptor is first applied to determine its position from roads. Two advantages can be gained from this scheme, there is no need of background subtraction and it is extremely efficient for real-time analysis applications. After vehicle detection, a new lamp response function is defined for isolating red components from the detected vehicle for rear lamp detection without using any thresholds. This is very different and superior to other state-of-art frameworks in the literature. The positions of rear lamp can be then accurately located by searching the peaks of lamp response function even under daytime or nighttime conditions. To recognize the statuses of a rear lamp, no training stage is needed to train a classifier for lamp status analysis. To achieve this goal, a new mask is designed to make status judgments on a lamp according to only its response sign. Because no any threshold is adopted, various rear lamps and their statuses can be accurately analyzed even under various lighting conditions.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313424","Vehicle detection;symmetrical SURF;rear lamp detection;vehicle indicator light status recognition","Vehicles;Vehicle detection;Image color analysis;Feature extraction;Roads;Real-time systems;Training","image classification;intelligent transportation systems;lamps;lighting;object detection;road vehicles","robust rear light status recognition;symmetrical SURF;vehicle indicator lights detection;symmetrical descriptor;rear lamp response function;rear lamp positions;daytime conditions;nighttime conditions;lamp status analysis classifier;status judgments;lighting conditions","","4","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In reality passengers' perception of different cost attributes may vary with time. This paper focuses on quantifying the temporal variation of passenger route choice behavior and its impact on overall passenger flow assignment. In order to efficiently estimate model parameters, we modify a previous model to a missing data problem by introducing latent variable on route choice outcomes for each travel time observation. The revised model can be estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We apply the proposed framework on Singapore's metro system and temporal grouped smart card transactions. We find that route choice coefficients vary substantially with time. The relative value of transfer time in terms of in-vehicle time ranges from 2 to 3, being higher at off-peak hours than during morning/evening peaks. The result suggests that passenger care more about total travel time during peak hours, whereas comfort (e.g., less transfer time) is of more concern to users during off-peaks. The proposed framework is general and can be applied on other networks.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313233","Data-driven;Metro network;Smart card data;Route choice;Flow assignment","Smart cards;Estimation;Data models;Sun;Adaptation models;Tin;Reliability","intelligent transportation systems;public transport;smart cards","temporal grouped smart card transaction;Singapore metro system;EM algorithm;expectation-maximization algorithm;reliability;passenger flow assignment patterns;smart card data;metro network;temporal flow assignment","","3","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially, for safety relevant tasks the computation of proper confidence levels even at degraded environments is of major importance. Low cost solutions that integrate GNSS and additional in-vehicle sensor information are able to bridge short periods of time with limited GNSS accessibility and can therefore improve availability and accuracy. However, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) effects in urban areas need special attention. This error source violates the estimated confidence and introduces an unobservable bias to the position solution. The algorithmic detection of these effects and the proper propagation of all uncertainties within a Bayes framework is one of the key technologies towards the adoption of GNSS for safety critical applications. This paper proposes a probabilistic NLOS detection algorithm that is able to improve both - accuracy and integrity of the position estimate in urban areas.

Highly dynamic traffic information is one of the most important features in vehicular networks, which makes data services very challenging, as the data quality drops over time dramatically and timely data update is expected to maintain the service quality. In this paper, we consider the system architecture, in which vehicles coming from different directions are able to sense and carry upto-date location-based information along their trajectories and upload fresh information to the roadside unit (RSU) when passing through. Meanwhile, vehicles may request information from the RSU for other routes. To enable efficient data services in such a scenario, firstly, we characterize the freshness of temporal data. Then, based on the general form of data quality function, we propose a heuristic algorithm called priority-based scheduling (PBS), which synthesizes the data quality, the broadcast effect and the real-time service requirement in making scheduling decisions.

Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication can also contribute to the VRU safety by allowing vehicles and pedestrians to exchange information. This solution is, however, largely affected by the reliability of the exchanged information, which most generally is the GPS data. Since perception and communication have complementary features, we can expect that a combination of such approaches can be a solution to the VRU safety. This is the motivation of the current work. We develop theoretical models to present the characteristics of perception and communications systems. Experimental studies are conducted to compare the performances of these techniques in real-world environments. Our results show that the perception system reliably detects pedestrians and other objects within 50 m of range in the line-of-sight (LOS) condition. In contrast, the V2P communication coverage is approximately 340 and 200 meters in LOS and non-LOS (NLOS) conditions, respectively. However, the communication-based system fails to correctly position the VRU w.r.t the vehicle, preventing the system from meeting the safety requirement. Finally, we propose a cooperative system that combines the outputs of the communication and perception systems.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313396","","Vehicles;Sensors;Communication systems;Safety;Nonlinear optics;Global Positioning System;Measurement","Global Positioning System;vehicular ad hoc networks","vulnerable road users;vehicle-to-pedestrian communication;V2P communication;VRU safety;GPS data;cooperative system","","7","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the amount of incoming data in intermodal route planning services is growing consistently and the reaction to unexpected events has to be fulfilled in real-time, the need for a solution which is able to deal with this requirements is rising. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a main component of an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), which is used to analyze and act on real-time streaming data and was designed to solve big data problems. We propose a conceptual architecture and a prototypical implementation of an EDA for a real-time intermodal route guide (RTiG) to assist traveler on their journey by providing travel assistance information in real-time and thus reacting on unexpected events.

"Geometric Congestion Detection Algorithms in the Speed-Flow and Flow-Density Spaces","E. Moylan; D. Rey; S. T. Waller","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2763","2769","Many ITS applications rely on known attributes of the traffic conditions. One useful property is congestion state which allows for differential behaviour in the system when demand is below, at or above capacity. Congestion detection in certain common data types such as loop detectors is frequently and idiosyncratically addressed by many researchers and practitioners. A set of flexible, objective and robust methods would facilitate the comparison of congestion state across datasets, locations and times of day to better model the response of the system to ITS interventions. This work develops geometric congestion detection algorithms for use in speed-flow and flow-density space. The methods are applicable to any dataset comprised of vehicle flows and speeds (such as loop detector data). The speed-flow space algorithm attempts to identify clusters in speed-flow space based on effective capacity and a cut-off free flow speed. The flow-density diagram builds on the theory supporting the triangular fundamental diagram and classifies congestion based on a density cut-off. Both methods incorporate time-of-day selection. The methods are successful in identifying clearly congested or uncongested observations along a test corridor. In conjunction, the two methods are able to distinguish two regions of ambiguity associated with the transition from uncongested to congested and vice versa. The combination of the two methods offers a promising approach for quickly and robustly classifying observations from a variety of location-typologies into two, three or four traffic states depending on the application.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313536","","Robustness;Monitoring;Mathematical model;Detection algorithms;Australia;Approximation algorithms;Detectors","intelligent transportation systems;road traffic","geometric congestion detection algorithms;speed-flow spaces;flow-density spaces;ITS applications;traffic conditions;flow-density diagram;triangular fundamental diagram","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When driving on a highway, humans are able to recognize the maneuver intentions of surrounding vehicles by observing lateral and longitudinal motion cues. The main idea presented in this paper is to adapt this ability to technical systems by formulating simple logic rules for intention recognition of highway maneuvers. As such, the presented algorithm is able to recognize the intention of left and right lane change maneuvers with an accuracy of approximately 89% while maintaining the false positive rate low at approximately 3%. Further, due to the algorithm's low computational complexity, flexibility, and straight-forward design based on easily comprehensible logic rules, the proposed method fulfills the requirements of future advanced driver assistance systems or fully automated driving systems.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313251","","Vehicles;Road transportation;Accuracy;Sensitivity;Prediction algorithms;Safety;Acceleration","driver information systems;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;road traffic;road vehicles","rule-based highway maneuver intention recognition;advanced driver assistance system;ADAS;automated driving system;traffic situation classification;road vehicle;motion cue;logic rule","","3","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Road traffic congestion is an omnipresent problem, which leads to delays, time loss, human stress, energy consumption, environmental pollution e.c.t. In order to decrease traffic congestion, there is a need for simulating and optimizing traffic control and improving traffic management. There are different ways for traffic congestion monitoring and analysis such as using video monitoring and surveillance systems, or static and dynamic sensors which allow traffic management in real time. There are also other methods using non real time analysis where traf?c congestion can be extracted from historical patterns of traf?c congestion. The historical patterns can be gained from the stored travel time and speed data. The goal of enhancing driver convenience is achieved by providing applications based on road traffic condition that mainly identifies congestion status. This paper presents a web application which uses live traffic congestion data from Google Maps traffic layer for real time congestion calculation. A technique utilized for estimating the level of congestion is image processing. The main objective is to provide an automated and yet interactive visualization tool for congestion analysis in real time. The aim is reducing the traffic congestion on roads which will lead to decrease in the number of accidents. It can provide important data which can help road traffic management. Thus, it is mainly dedicated to traffic managers, operators and analysts. Nevertheless it can be implemented also by road users. Unlike most sensor based applications, it makes quantified congestion data available even in regions with limited traffic data information.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313335","Road Traffic Congestion;Google Maps Traffic Layer;Visualization;Image Processing","Roads;Google;Data visualization;Real-time systems;Vehicles;Sensors;Image color analysis","data visualisation;delays;energy consumption;geographic information systems;interactive systems;pollution control;real-time systems;road traffic control","traffic congestion analysis visualisation tool;urban population;private cars;urgent transportation problem;road traffic congestion;delays;time loss;human stress;energy consumption;environmental pollution;traffic control;historical patterns;Google Maps traffic layer;real time congestion calculation;interactive visualization tool;road traffic management","","5","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent works on carpooling and journey planning take into account, besides mobility match, also social aspects and, more generally, non-monetary rewards. In line with this, we present a data-driven methodology for a more enjoyable carpooling. We introduce a measure of enjoyability based on people's interests, social links, and tendency to connect to people with similar or dissimilar interests. We devise a methodology to compute enjoyability from crowd-sourced data, and we show how this can be used on real world datasets to optimize for both mobility and enjoyability. Our methodology was tested on real data from Rome and San Francisco. We compare the results of an optimization model minimizing the number of cars, and a greedy approach maximing the enjoyability. We evaluate them in terms of cars saved, and average enjoyability of the system. We present also the results of a user study, with more than 200 users reporting an interest of 39% in the enjoyable solution.

Hoogendoorn","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1129","1136","Coordinated ramp metering is an effective means to reduce freeway bottleneck delay by postponing the moment of a flow breakdown and the associated capacity drop. To this aim, vehicles are stored at upstream located ramps to reduce the flow towards the bottleneck, causing delays at the ramps to both vehicles that move towards the bottleneck and to those that leave the network elsewhere. There are several different network characteristics that determine the resulting total ramp and bottleneck delays, and hence, whether it is beneficial to include a ramp into the set of coordinated ramps. In this contribution an approach is put forward to make an adequate decision on which ramps should be coordinated given the situation at hand. To quantify the resulting ramp and bottleneck delays, cumulative inflow and outflow curves are developed as a function of the involved situation-specific variables. This enables us to determine the optimal set of coordinated ramps beforehand and to gain insight into the effects of the system variables that determine the delays. By means of a test case the effects are illustrated and a worked example is given of finding such optimal set of coordinated ramps. Results show that the duration of the peak period and the size of the capacity drop strongly determine the delay at the bottleneck, and hence the coordination benefits of postponing the moment of the capacity drop. These variables also have a large influence on the minimum required share of ramp traffic to the bottleneck (i.e. break even share), that determines whether it is beneficial to include the ramp into the coordination.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313279","","Delays;Traffic control;Electric breakdown;Mathematical model;Shape;Space vehicles","intelligent transportation systems;road pricing (tolls);road vehicles","cumulative outflow curve;cumulative inflow curve;bottleneck delay;freeway;coordinated ramp metering scheme;on-ramp selection methodology","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Testing is a significant technical method to ensure the safety and reliability of high-speed train control system. For a long time, how to generate test cases and how to ensure their completeness are the key issues in the testing of train control system, which have a direct bearing on the efficiency and quality of the testing. Mutation testing, which can simulate most kinds of fault models of the system, provides an alternative or complementary method to measure test sufficiency. At the same time, new test cases can be generated by mutation analysis if the completeness of the test cases is not enough, which are added in the test case set to improve its completeness. In this paper, we introduce the mutation testing based on Timed Automata (TA), which is suitable for analyzing the high-speed train control system and evaluating the completeness of the test cases. Firstly, we analyze the main functions of the typical scenario of RBC handover process and use TA theory to model it. Secondly, test cases of the scenario are evaluated and we get the index to donate the completeness of them.

"Preliminary Benefit Analysis for Pedestrian Crash Imminent Braking Systems","D. H. Good; S. Chien; L. Li; K. Krutilla; Y. Chen","NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1123","1128","In the US, the number of traffic fatalities has had a long term downward trend as a result of advances in the crash worthiness of vehicles. However, these improvements in crash worthiness do little to help protect non-motorists. Over the last few years, this has been reflected in the number of pedestrian fatalities increasing in both absolute and relative terms (up over 15% since 2009). In 2011 there were 4,432 pedestrians killed and an estimated 69,000 pedestrian injuries. This increased to 4,735 pedestrian fatalities in 2013 [1,2,3]. Recently, manufacturers have begun developing a second generation of crash avoidance systems that recognize and mitigate non-motorist collisions. This paper evaluates the performance of one implementation of this type of systems that is currently available for consumer purchase. System performance is assessed using a broad range of crash scenarios that were developed based on US crash data as found in GES and FARS for the harmonized years of 2010 and 2011. Test track simulations under these scenarios realistic settings based on the analysis of crash reports after eliminating pedestrian crash geometries that are not relevant for these ""forward looking"" systems. This generated a sample size 689 crash tests for one vehicle type where various measures of crash mitigation are constructed. Our analysis here focuses on the ability of these systems to prevent fatalities, serious injuries and prevent crashes altogether. We find that the evaluated system is about 30% effective in mitigating crashes, fatalities and social cost, those these mitigations occur for different types of crashes. For example, complete mitigation occurs for primarily low speed crashes which fatality prevention occurs for much higher speed crashes where impact occurs though at a lower speed. There are some crash geometries where no mitigation occurs, specifically those where the driver is in active control of the vehicle during turning maneuvers. Finally, we offer some suggestions about the appropriateness of future regulatory policy.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313278","Pedestrian Crash Imminent Braking;Benefit Analysis;Pre-Crash System Performance Analysis","Vehicle crash testing;Vehicles;Injuries;Computer crashes;System performance;Predictive models;Turning","injuries;pedestrians;road accidents;road safety;road vehicles","mitigate nonmotorist collision;pedestrian fatality;FARS;GES;US crash data;crash avoidance system;pedestrian crash imminent braking system;preliminary benefit analysis","","2","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Optimal Speed Profile Generation for Airport Ground Movement with Consideration of Emissions","J. Chen; M. Weiszer; P. Stewart","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1797","1802","Emissions during the ground movement are mostly calculated based on International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) emission databank. The fuel flow rate is normally assumed as a constant, hence the emission index. Therefore, no detailed discrimination of power settings during ground movement is considered to account for different emissions at different power settings. This may lead to a suboptimal and often unrealistic taxi planning. At the heart of the recently proposed Active Routing (AR) framework for airport ground movement is the unimpeded optimal speed profile generation, taking into account both time and fuel efficiency. However, emissions have not been included in the process of generating optimal speed profiles. Taking into account emissions in ground operations is not a trial task as not all emissions can be reduced on the same path of reducing time and fuel burn. In light of this, in this paper, a detailed analysis of three main emissions at the airports, viz. CO, Total Hydrocarbon (HC), and NOx, are carried out in order to obtain a minimum number of conflicting objectives for generating optimal speed profiles. The results show that NOx has a strong linear correlation with fuel burn across all aircraft categories. For the heavy aircraft, HC and CO should be treated individually apart from the time and fuel burn objectives. For medium and light aircraft, a strong correlation between HC, CO and time has been observed, indicating a reduced number of objectives will be sufficient to account for taxi time, fuel burn and emissions. The generated optimal speed profiles with consideration of different emissions will have impact on the resulted taxiing planning using the AR and also affect decisions regarding airport regulations.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313384","Multi-objective optimisation;Active Routing;fuel consumption;emissions;speed profile generation;airport ground movement","Fuels;Aircraft;Public transportation;Airports;Acceleration;Optimization;Correlation","aircraft;airports;optimisation;transportation","optimal speed profile generation;airport ground movement;International Civil Aviation Organisation;ICAO emission databank;fuel flow rate;suboptimal taxi planning;active routing framework;CO emissions;hydrocarbon emissions;NOx emissions;aircraft","","1","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the approaches to solving the SFLP is to aggregate the demand into discrete points first and then solve the corresponding point-based FLP as a surrogate model. The model performance, however, is measured by the percentage of the continuous space actually covered. The solution to the classic FLP is often not unique. In this paper, we explore how the behavior of the solution to the FLP would affect the quality of the coverage to the spatial demand. We examine in detail the property of the surrogate model and identify the key contributing factor that would affect the quality of the solution to the original coverage problem for covering continuous spatial demand.

One of the challenges for automotive industry is to develop the completely autonomous car. Even if proven feasible, the autonomous driving car is still an important research subject due to systems complexity, costs and legislation. The paper describes an experimental car that Renault is actively developing in partnership with research laboratories and outlines its usage in terms of Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP). During development, a common Renault Zoe vehicle was equipped with sensors, electro-mechanical actuators and a system of data processing. The perception system corresponds to a fusion between an ultrasonic system and a camera. It provides the localization of the vehicle, the navigable area around the car and a map of already visited areas.

"Stuck Around the Stadium? An Approach to Identify Road Segments Affected by Planned Special Events","S. Kwoczek; S. D. Martino; W.

Lots of these studies are focused on learning the impact of influencing factors on traffic, such as rush hour or accidents. Nevertheless, only very few have investigated the impact of Planned Special Events (PSEs), such as concerts, soccer games, etc., despite their well-known influence on traffic. In this paper we present an automatic solution to model the impact of PSEs on traffic around the venue of the events. In particular, we answer the question of ""which road segments are affected by PSEs?"" by identifying which roads show an event specific behavior that can identify the happening of a PSE reliably. For that, we propose a solution based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier that is trained on traffic data on event and non-event days for each road. The proposed approach has been evaluated on two different venues in Germany with a leave-one-out cross-validation performed on all the soccer matches played in those locations during the season 2013/14 of the German First League. Results show that the approach can reliably identify road segments affected by PSEs, with an F-Measure up to 0.97.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313298","","Roads;Games;Artificial neural networks;Cities and towns;Reliability;Delays;Correlation","intelligent transportation systems;neural nets;pattern classification;road traffic","road segments;planned special events;PSEs;mobility prediction;road traffic;artificial neural network classifier;ANN classifier;Germany;German First League soccer matches","","4","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Snow on urban roads disturbs traveling of vehicles as a huge amount of snow is piled up on roadsides, which often obstructs smooth driving. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict the speed of vehicles on each road segment in snowy cities. This estimation is helpful for urban traffic planning of local government or trip planning of residents. We collect weather information such as the highest temperature, daylight hours, snow depth and snowfall of the previous day and current new snowfall and vehicular traffic data of each road segment obtained from floating car data such as the average speed in summer and the speed of the previous day. We have built a speed model of vehicles for each road segment in snowy conditions as a linear combination of those factors. Then we enumerate multiple factors which might have some influence on vehicle speed in snowy conditions and have derived their weights by using multiple regression analysis. We have applied the proposed method to major road segments in Sapporo City, Japan and derived multiple regression functions using real weather information and vehicular traffic data.

The three-layer structure of the vision-based framework can obviously reduce both false positives and false negatives of taillight detection.

In general, in case of choice contexts where the uncertainty is due to the actual travel times variances and/or the information accuracy, travelers' reaction, usually modeled by considering the utility maximization paradigm, may be affected by the risk perception. However, depending on the considered tool for collecting data (driving vs. web-based simulator) different behaviors (such as risk aversion) may be observed. This paper aims to applying the Cumulative Prospect theory in order to model travelers' behavior in a risky route choice context using data collected by different tools. In particular, in this paper data collected by (static) driving simulator and (web-based) travel simulator are compared by aggregated analysis. Finally, the results of the modelling approach are shown in order to properly evaluate how the simulation environment may affect the travelers' risk perception by introducing a bias in alternative choice.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.60","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313152","Simulator;Route choice;ATIS;Risk perception;Cumulative Prospect Theory","Accuracy;Context;Uncertainty;Reliability;Context modeling;Analysis of variance;Solid modeling","intelligent transportation systems;Internet","risk perception;route choice experiments;cumulative prospect theory;route choice context;information accuracy;utility maximization paradigm;Web-based simulator;static driving simulator;Web-based travel simulator","","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Classification is performed with kNN (k Nearest Neighbors) method, which has been commonly used in shape-based vehicle classification studies in the past. For gradient-based classification, we employ HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features. Instead of searching a whole video frame, we extract the features in the region located by the foreground silhouette. We use SVM (Support Vector Machines) as the classifier since HOG+SVM is a commonly used pair in visual object detection. The vehicle types that we worked on are motorcycle, car and van (minibus). In experiments, we first analyze the performances of shape-based and HOG-based classifiers separately.

User feedback is used to compute the route's fuel consumption level for other vehicles to build their minimum path routes. When a vehicle traverses a road link, it reports its fuel consumption on this link to a Traffic Management Center (TMC), which updates the vehicles routing information and then vehicles are assigned routes based on this updated information. The vehicular network is responsible for transferring this information from vehicles to the TMC, where packets are subjected to delays and drops. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous research efforts on eco-routing studied the effect of the data network and communication parameters on the performance of eco-routing algorithms. This paper, firstly, introduces a realistic simulation framework for eco-routing that can capture all the details of both the transportation and the communication networks. Secondly, it studies the effect of communication parameters on the eco-routing performance. The results show that the errors due to data packet drops and delay are not significant. Consequently, the algorithm is robust against drops and delay. However, the number and locations of the roadside units (RSUs) are important factors that affect the network-wide fuel consumption level.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313112","ITS;VANET;simulation;application;eco-routing;fuel consumption","Vehicles;Fuels;Delays;Roads;Routing;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling","telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","V2I communication;system evaluation;transportation networks;user feedback;road link;traffic management center;TMC;vehicle routing information;data network;communication parameters;eco-routing algorithms;communication networks;roadside units;RSU;network wide fuel consumption level","","2","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Färber","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1041","1048","In the field of active safety driver assistance systems, emergency steering interventions are subject to current research initiatives like UR:BAN. On the one hand, such systems can potentially prohibit accidents even if it is too late to brake to a standstill. On the other hand, such interventions with a lateral component introduce new challenges to controllability assessment. Countermeasures to avoid accidents in critical situations can not only be performed by the driver with the system on board, but also by other road users. Hence, a possible approach is the investigation of controllability aspects of emergency steering systems from the perspective of opposing traffic participants. To work out clear limitations for the functional design of these systems due to the accident avoiding capabilities of opposing drivers, relevant functional parameters and driving situations were identified and investigated with 48 naïve participants using the Vehicle in the Loop (VIL). The results show that the driving situation has an influence on the drivers' judgment and behavior. Drivers were able to avoid accidents with oncoming evading vehicles by steering and/or braking, if the time gap between the peak of the evasion trajectory and the drivers' vehicle was at least two seconds.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313265","Vehicle in the Loop;Emergency Steering;Controllability;Opposing Traffic","Vehicles;Controllability;Accidents;Acceleration;Analysis of variance;Steering systems;Roads","controllability;driver information systems;road safety;road traffic;steering systems;traffic engineering computing","automatic evasion;opposing traffic;vehicle in the loop;active safety driver assistance systems;emergency steering interventions;UR:BAN;lateral component;controllability assessment;emergency steering systems;functional design;functional parameters;VIL","","1","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we derive temporal requirements on future ADAS operation, needed to at least match human driving behavior in dense traffic.

Such systems are only reasonable, if the bikes are available where the users need them at a certain time though. In so-called free-floating systems as it's implemented in Munich, the user is allowed to rent and return a bike within a clearly defined operating area. However, on one hand there are zones, where a shortage of returned bikes occurs. No bikes are available but needed there. On the other hand there are zones, where too many bikes were returned but the demand for renting a bike there is too low. Based on a detailed GPS-Data Analysis for the bike sharing system, mobility patterns of the usage were identified. Depending on different factors like weather conditions, time of the day and holidays/weekends, a demand model was created in order to obtain an optimal distribution of bikes within the operating area.

In this context, travelers have not to rely on a single selected path, but they have to use a strategy, i.e. set of rules that allow travelers to reach the destination maximizing their expected utility. The availability of real-time predictive information requires the traditional optimal hyper-path approaches to be overcame and new ones to be developed. Further, as the values of path attributes forecasted are random variables and therefore, also with an information system, the uncertainty is not completely overcome.

Several approaches have been proposed to alleviate the effects of traffic congestion, however, so far congestion is still a big problem in most cities. In this work we investigate a new route reservation approach to address the problem which is motivated by air traffic control. This paper formulates the route reservation problem under different assumptions and examines the complexity of the resulting formulations. Two waiting strategies are investigated, (i) vehicles are allowed to wait at the source before they start their journey, and (ii) they are allowed to wait at every road junction. Strategy (i) though more practical to implement, results to an NP-complete problem while strategy (ii) results to a problem that can be solved in polynomial time but it is not easily implemented since the infrastructure does not have adequate space for vehicles to wait until congestion downstream is cleared. Finally, a heuristic algorithm (based on time-expanded networks) is derived as a solution to both proposed waiting strategies.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313545","","Vehicles;Roads;Junctions;NP-complete problem;Routing;Polynomials","air traffic control;computational complexity;road traffic control;vehicle routing","congestion free routing;transportation networks;traffic congestion;air traffic control;road junction;NP-complete problem;polynomial time","","1","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Density Peaks Clustering Approach for Discovering Demand Hot Spots in City-scale Taxi Fleet Dataset","D. Liu; S. Cheng; Y. Yang","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1831","1836","In this paper, we introduce a variant of the density peaks clustering (DPC) approach for discovering demand hot spots from a low-frequency, low-quality taxi fleet operational dataset. From the literature, the DPC approach mainly uses density peaks as features to discover potential cluster centers, and this requires distances between all pairs of data points to be calculated. This implies that the DPC approach can only be applied to cases with relatively small numbers of data points. For the domain of urban taxi operations that we are interested in, we could have millions of demand points per day, and calculating all-pair distances between all demand points would be practically impossible, thus making DPC approach not applicable. To address this issue, we project all points to a density image and execute our variant of the DPC algorithm on the processed image. Experiment results show that our proposed DPC variant could get similar results as original DPC, yet with much shorter execution time and lower memory consumption. By running our DPC variant on a real-world dataset collected in Singapore, we show that there are indeed recurrent demand hot spots within the central business district that are not covered by the current taxi stand design. Our approach could be of use to both taxi fleet operator and traffic planners in guiding drivers and setting up taxi stands.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313389","","Clustering algorithms;Public transportation;Vehicles;Algorithm design and analysis;Memory management;Lattices;Business","pattern clustering;traffic information systems;transportation","traffic planners;taxi fleet operator;taxi stand design;memory consumption;execution time;all-pair distances;urban taxi operations;cluster centers;low-frequency low-quality taxi fleet operational dataset;DPC;city-scale taxi fleet dataset;demand hot spots discovery;density peaks clustering approach","","7","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because they have always accumulated error, an automatic calibration system of vehicle motion error under GPS blind area is proposed. Firstly, when a vehicle moves to the detected area, the self-organizing network based on Zigbee sends signals to trigger the camera of road side unit (RSU), starting to collect images and preprocess. And then the signals of four different RFID tags read by vehicle mounted RFID reader are used to implement vehicle positioning. Meanwhile, vehicle position is also detected and calculated by image processing based on background difference method. Finally, two kinds of positioning information are fused according to time synchronization, which result is applied to amend accumulated positioning error produced by odometer method, to realize vehicle location automatic calibration. Experimental data shows that this method has accurate positioning information, and can effectively eliminate the vehicle accumulated error.

However, the variability of vehicle and background poses an enormous challenge. In this paper, an approach used 4-dimensional mapping of RGB colors and integrated with corners and edges features is proposed to detect preceding vehicles in images, addressing the shortage of existent vision-based methods in the environment with complicated background and different luminance. Firstly RGB colors in images are mapped into a 4-dimensional space and therefore the corresponding positions subjected to vehicles or background can be classified by support vector machine, of which parameters are optimized with Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Hence, by using morphological processing, hypothetical areas of vehicles can be preliminary segmented. In addition, corners and edges features in RGB images are useful to verify vehicle hypotheses, so the feature matrixes integrated with corners and edges of hypothetical areas are calculated as to obtain feature vectors after reducing dimensions, the feature vectors from different hypotheses can be classified and thus the very vehicles areas can be labeled. Experiment results show that this novel approach has a better performance in complicated backgrounds and enervates the adverse effect of illumination with different intensity at the same time.

"Driver Intention Algorithm for Pedestrian Protection and Automated Emergency Braking Systems","F. Diederichs; T. Schüttke; D. Spath","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1049","1054","Driver intention recognition reveals an enormous potential for automated driving. Current automated emergency braking (AEB) systems warn and take over vehicle control in case of frontal collision risks. It is of high interest to detect driver's intention before initiating such transitions to automated driving in order to avoid annoyance. Also the number of warnings can be reduced when driver intention recognition indicates a safe behavior planning. Especially pedestrian protection systems will benefit in urban environments where pedestrians potentially enter the vehicle trajectory frequently. The paper describes the development of a driver intention detection algorithm for automated emergency braking systems. The data for the development is collected in a driving simulator study with 32 participants, balanced roughly by gender, age and driving style. Every participant circulated in an urban environment with random pedestrian traffic. In six scenarios data were collected where a pedestrian was either on the road or walked towards the road. An automated emergency braking system would activate a warning and eventually an automated braking in such situations. This could be adapted or cancelled in case of an existing braking intention by the driver. A fixed base Face Lab Eyetracking device stored gaze patterns in relation to the pedestrians' position on the presentation screen. Pedal activity was also recorded. The analysis of both data sources allowed the development of a rule based algorithm to detect driver's intention to brake due to the pedestrian. The algorithm proposes a sequential analysis of eye gaze and pedal activity and is presented and discussed in this paper. The algorithm correlated highly with a driver intention recognition reference method developed earlier by Diederichs & Pöhler [1]. In 94 % of the scenarios the algorithm and the reference method match in their results.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313266","driver intention;maneuver prediction;automated driving;automated emergency braking;pedestrian protection","Vehicles;Brakes;Roads;Classification algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Planning;Atmospheric measurements","automobiles;braking;driver information systems;gaze tracking;pedestrians;road safety","driver intention algorithm;automated emergency braking systems;driver intention recognition;automated driving;vehicle control;frontal collision risks;pedestrian protection systems;vehicle trajectory;driver intention detection algorithm;driving simulator;urban environment;random pedestrian traffic;fixed base face lab eyetracking device stored gaze patterns;sequential analysis;eye gaze;pedal activity","","8","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the effectiveness of these systems is expected to be highly dependent on the pre-crash acceleration behavior of drivers prior to these crashes. The first objective of this study was to use pre-crash acceleration data downloaded from Event Data Recorders (EDRs) to evaluate previously developed acceleration profile models that were based off of ""typical"" acceleration data. Our second objective was to develop a novel acceleration profile model using this pre-crash data. This study used EDR-recorded pre-crash speeds from 89 intersection crashes investigated as part of National Automotive Sampling System / Crashworthiness Data System (NASS/CDS). A 10-fold cross-validation procedure was implemented to generate and evaluate a quadratic-decreasing acceleration profile model developed from this pre-crash data. Our results indicate that previously generated models underestimate pre-crash acceleration behavior of vehicles involved in intersection crashes. An improved, nationally-representative acceleration profile is also presented that should be considered by researchers interested in simulating pre-intersection crash acceleration behavior.

Low","NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2424","2431","This paper proposed a flexible leader-follower formation tracking control design for nonholonomic tracked mobile robots. The mobile robots considered here are driven by low-level velocities control systems that possess non-trivial dynamical effects. The formation is flexible in the sense that its configuration is defined by a set of curvilinear-based longitudinal and lateral relative separations instead of commonly used rectilinear relative separations. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we proposed a novel curvilinear-based real-time formation reference generator to generate nonholonomic compatible formation reference pose for each robot to execute based on the most updated leader's motion information. Second, we integrate our recently developed nested-loop nonlinear trajectory tracking control scheme with the reference generator to achieve stable curvilinear-based formation maneuvers for the considered mobile robots without require any detailed model of the robots' low-level control systems. The control design allows the formation's leader to guide the formation of ground mobile robots stably without any pre-planned formation trajectory. The formation tracking control design was validated in both simulations and physical experimentation. Field trials were conducted in some off-road environments at different formation speeds up to 4m/sec to validate the control design. The formation controller was implemented on a sport utility vehicle (SUV) which acted as a leader, and a nonholonomic full-sized tracked vehicle, which acted as a follower vehicle.

This work presents a novel methodology based on the linear programming formulation of dynamic traffic assignment using the cell transmission model for solving the system optimal (SO) problem. The SO assignment is chosen because the communications and behavior protocols necessary to operate AV intersection and lane reversal controls could be used to assign routes and optimize network performance.

"Adaptive Group-Based Signal Control Using Reinforcement Learning with Eligibility Traces","J. Jin; X. Ma","NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2412","2417","Group-based signal controllers are widely deployed on urban networks in the Nordic countries. However, group-based signal controls are usually implemented with rather simple timing logics, e.g. vehicle actuated timing. In addition, group-based signal control systems with pre-defined signal parameter settings show relatively poor performances in a dynamically changed traffic environment. This study, therefore, presents an adaptive group-based signal control system capable of changing control strategies with respect to non-stationary traffic demands. In this study, signal groups are formulated as individual agents. The signal group agent learns from traffic environments and makes intelligent timing decisions according to the perceived system states. Reinforcement learning with multiple-step backups is applied as the learning algorithm. Agents on-line update their knowledge based on a sequence of states during the learning process rather than purely on the basis of single previous state. The proposed signal control system is integrated into a software-in-the-loop simulation (SILS) framework for evaluation purpose. In the testbed experiments, the proposed adaptive group-based control system is compared to a benchmark signal control system, the well-established group-based fixed-time control system. The simulation results demonstrate that learning-based and adaptive group-based signal control system owns its advantage in dealing with dynamic traffic environments in terms of improving traffic mobility efficiency.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313481","","Control systems;Green products;Adaptive systems;Vehicles;Learning (artificial intelligence);Delays","adaptive control;control engineering computing;digital simulation;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic control;traffic engineering computing","adaptive group-based signal control system;reinforcement learning algorithm;urban networks;Nordic countries;timing logic;signal parameter settings;agent learning;software-in-the-loop simulation;SILS framework;group-based fixed-time control system;traffic mobility efficiency","","2","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deterministic and stochastic models were applied using four independent and univariate time series from the crash data collected by the Nevada Department of Transportation. The best model specification was obtained using root mean square error and mean absolute percent prediction error as goodness of fit. Among several deterministic models evaluated in this study, the Winter-additive model for seasonal data and the Damped-trend model for non-seasonal data provided adequate forecasts. In the case of stochastic models, for non-seasonal data, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model provided acceptable results. However, the absence of adequate data likely precludes an appropriate estimation using the ARIMA model. For seasonal data, a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model provided the best forecast measures. The stochastic SARIMA(0,0,5)(0,1,1)12 model, an improved model, had a preferred fit for predicting the number of fatalities and serious injuries in Nevada over a five-year horizon.

The formation configuration considered here is based on curvilinear relative longitudinal and lateral separations instead of the commonly used rectilinear relative separations. And the tracked mobile robots assumed here are equipped with low-level velocities control systems with non-trivial dynamical effects. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we proposed a curvilinear-based real-time formation reference generator to generate formation reference poses and velocities correspond to the time-varying formation configuration. Second, we develop a nonlinear tracking controller for each robot to follow its real-time generated formation reference pose with guaranteed stability. One of the key challenges that the nonlinear tracking controller handles is the tracking of the formation reference pose that may not satisfy the nonholonomic kinematic constraints where on the other hand, the considered mobile robots are nonholonomic. One positive feature of this control design is that it does not require any detailed model of the robots' low-level velocities control systems to implement the control design on the physical mobile robots.

Our system learns color appearance models for free-space and obstacle classes in an online and self-supervised fashion. To this end, it applies a disparity-based segmentation, which can run in the background of the critical system path, either with a time delay of several frames or at a frame rate that is only a third of that of the color-based algorithm. In parallel, the most recent video frame is analyzed solely with these learned color appearance models, without an actual disparity estimate and the corresponding latency. This translates into a reduced response time from data acquisition to data analysis, which is a critical property for high-speed ADAS.

However, it is by far too time-consuming to build test sets of all environmental combinations by recording real video data. Our approach facilitates the generation of comparable test sets by using largely reduced amounts of real on-road records and subsequent application of computer-generated environmental variations.

"Mitigating Bunching with Bus-following Models and Bus-to-Bus Cooperation","K. Ampountolas; M. Kring","NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","60","65","Bus bunching is an instability problem where buses operating on high frequency public transport lines arrive at stops in bunches. In this work, we unveil that bus-following models can be used to design bus-to-bus cooperative control strategies and mitigate bunching. The use of bus-following models avoids the explicit modelling of bus-stops, which would render the resulting problem discrete, with events occurring at arbitrary time intervals. In a ""follow-the-leader"" two-bus system, bus-to-bus communication allows the driver of the following bus to observe (from a remote distance) the position and speed of a lead bus operating in the same transport line. The information transmitted from the lead bus is then used to control the speed of the follower to eliminate bunching. In this context, we first propose practical linear and nonlinear control laws to regulate space headways and speeds, which would lead to bunching cure. Then a combined state estimation and remote control scheme, which is based on the Linear-Quadratic Gaussian theory, is developed to capture the effect of bus stops, traffic disturbances, and randomness in passenger arrivals. To investigate the behaviour and performance of the developed approaches the 9-km 1-California line in San Francisco with about 50 arbitrary spaced bus stops is used.

"2-ASCET for Broadband Multicarrier Transmission over In-home and In-vehicle Power Line Networks","F. A. Pinto- Benel; F. Cruz-Roldán","NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1351","1356","Data transmission over power line networks is a challenging telecommunication problem whose interest has grown up in recent years. Within different technologies, Wavelet OFDM has been recommended as medium access technique for broadband power line communications (PLCs). In IEEE 1901, the wavelet OFDM physical layer (PHY) defines a transmitter based on cosine-modulated filter bank (CMFB), for which due to the power line channel features, a receiver with an efficient equalizer is needed. In this work, we obtain the value of the coefficients of an equalizer integrated in an Adaptive Sine-Modulated/Cosine-Modulated Filter Bank Equalizer for Transmultiplexers (ASCET), which could be used to compensate for the power line channel effects. Our proposal focuses on the two-order system, analyzing the frequency points to be sampled and deriving the theoretical expression to obtain its coefficients. With the aim of evaluating the performance of this equalizer, a comparison between 2-ASCET and lower-order ASCET, (0-ASCET and 1-ASCET) is carried out considering in-home and in-vehicle scenarios. This study is completed with several computer simulations.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313314","Power Line Communications (PLC);transportion system;transportation electrification;Adaptive Sine-Modulated/Cosine-Modulated Filter Bank Equalizer for Transmultiplexers (ASCET);cosine-modulated filter bank (CMFB)","Equalizers;OFDM;Signal to noise ratio;Noise measurement;Broadband communication;Modulation","broadband networks;carrier transmission on power lines;channel bank filters;OFDM modulation","broadband multicarrier transmission;2-ASCET;invehicle power line networks;inhome power line networks;data transmission;telecommunication problem;medium access technique;broadband power line communications;PLC;wavelet OFDM physical layer;PHY;CMFB;power line channel features;adaptive sine modulated/cosine modulated filter bank equalizer for transmultiplexers;power line channel effects","","4","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Interaction Protocols for Cooperative Merging and Lane Reduction Scenarios","E. S. Kazerooni; J. Ploeg","NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1964","1970","This paper presents the interaction protocols developed for execution of two common scenarios in daily traffic using cooperative automated vehicles. The first proposed scenario addresses merging of a (semi-)automated car on a highway within a platoon of (semi-)automated vehicles. The second scenario is an extension of the first scenario with a focus on a lane reduction where a platoon of automated vehicles merges into a second one on a different lane. The proposed interaction protocols are characterized by a sequence of maneuvers to execute the scenarios together with the corresponding communication message sets. Moreover, the vehicle control system should be equipped to implement these protocols. Therefore, the design strategy should address the interaction protocol as well as the control system design. The most important feature of the proposed design strategy is to decompose the scenarios into a sequence of basic maneuvers. This method provides a generic solution which can be implemented to other scenarios, too. Also, the thought behind the design approach is to follow the pattern that human drivers interact in similar daily traffic occasions as well as to ensure a distributed decision making mechanism where no fixed supervisor is required. In both scenarios, the platoon controllers are active to achieve the common control objective of platooning. However, for realization of the proposed scenarios, additional controllers are needed to perform the scenario-specific tasks.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313410","","Vehicles;Merging;Protocols;Control systems;Roads;Synchronization;Aerospace electronics","control system synthesis;decision making;road traffic control","ïnteraction protocols;cooperative merging;lane reduction scenarios;road traffic;cooperative automated vehicles;semiautomated car;communication message sets;vehicle control system;control system design;distributed decision making mechanism","","9","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the reasons why this problem is so hard to solve is because there are no readily available methods to infer unmet taxi demand from data. An algorithm that reliably does so would be of enormous value to fleet operators because it could be used to dispatch available taxis to areas where passenger demand greatly exceeds supply. In this paper, we formally define unmet taxi demand and develop a heuristic algorithm to quantify it. We explain how our method improves on traditional approaches and present the theoretical details which underpin our algorithm.

The system receives information regarding the traffic light timings, produces a set of maneuvers every 100 ms and then selects the motion with the minimum initial jerk.

"An Evolutionary Multi-objective Approach for Stochastic Air Traffic Network Flow Optimization","M. Xiao; K. Cai; F. Linke","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2059","2065","The Stochastic Air Traffic Network Flow Optimization (SATNFO) problem aims to seek a set of optimum and robust flight plans to ensure a safe, orderly and expeditious air traffic flow in the presence of uncertainties. Due to the very natures of multi-objective, large-scale and non-separable in the SATNFO problem, this paper sparks an evolutionary multi-objective optimization way for solving it. Firstly, we formulate it as a multi-objective problem, with performance and robustness as separate goals. In this model, robustness, which indicates the ability of a flight plan to cope with negative effects of uncertainty, is quantified and introduced as an objective. And, two conflicting performance objectives, i.e., minimizing the workload as well as the flight delays over the network, are involved. Then, we present an adaptive metaheuristic algorithm, termed as aNSGA-II, to solve the SATNFO problem. In aNSGA-II, a parameter adaptive mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the probability of crossover and mutation based on problem context and evolution mechanism. It helps to balance exploitation and exploration during the evolutionary process, and thus maintain diversity of solutions and improve the convergence performance of the algorithm. Empirical studies using real data of flights and network in China are carried out, and show ability of our approach in providing efficient and robust flight plans and supporting better decision-making for air traffic controllers in a stochastic scenario.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313425","stochastic air traffic network flow optimization;uncertainty;metaheuristic;multi-objective;self-adaption","Uncertainty;Robustness;Optimization;Airports;Delays;Capacity planning;Sociology","air traffic;genetic algorithms;stochastic systems;transportation","stochastic air traffic network flow optimization;SATNFO problem;evolutionary multiobjective optimization way;adaptive metaheuristic algorithm;aNSGA-II;parameter adaptive mechanism;robustness;adaptive nondominated sorting genetic algorithm","","2","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Approximating the Effects of Installed Traffic Lights: A Behaviorist Approach Based on Travel Tracks","S. Baluja; M. Covell; R. Sukthankar","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2205","2212","Decades of research have been directed towards improving the timing of existing traffic lights. In many parts of the world where this research has been conducted, detailed maps of the streets and the precise locations of the traffic lights are publicly available. Continued timing research has recently been further spurred by the increasing ubiquity of personal cell-phone based GPS systems. Through their use, an enormous amount of travel tracks have been amassed -- thus providing an easy source of real traffic data. Nonetheless, one fundamental piece of information remains absent that limits the quantification of the benefits of new approaches: the existing traffic light schedules and traffic light response behaviors. Unfortunately, deployed traffic light schedules are often not known. Rarely are they kept in a central database, and even when they are, they are often not easily obtainable. The alternative, manual inspection of a system of multiple traffic lights may be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for many experimenters. Without the existing light schedules, it is difficult to ascertain the real-improvements that new traffic light algorithms and approaches will have -- especially on traffic patterns that have not yet been encountered in the collected data. To alleviate this problem, we present an approach to estimating existing traffic light schedules based on collected GPS-travel tracks. We present numerous ways to test the results and comprehensively demonstrate them on both synthetic and real data. One of the many uses, beyond studying the effects of existing lights in previously unencountered traffic flow environments, is to serve as a realistic baseline for light timing and schedule optimization studies.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313448","","Schedules;Correlation;Automobiles;Optimization;Timing;Roads;Genetic algorithms","Global Positioning System;traffic information systems","behaviorist approach;street maps;traffic light locations;personal cell-phone based GPS systems;traffic light schedules;traffic light response behaviors;central database;traffic patterns;GPS-travel tracks;synthetic data;real data;traffic flow environments;light timing optimization;light schedule optimization","","3","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rumpe","NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2280","2286","Context: Recently, test protocols from organizations like European New Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP) were extended to also cover active safety systems. Objective: The official EuroNCAP test protocol for Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)/Forward Collision Warning (FCW) systems explicitly defines to what extent a Vehicle-Under-Test (VUT) is allowed to vary in its lateral position. In addition, the United States New Car Assessment Programme (US NCAP) test protocol has broader tolerance ranges. The goal for automotive OEMs is to understand the impact of such allowed variations on a the overall vehicle's performance. Method: A simulation-based approach is outlined that allows systematic, large-scale analysis of such influences to effectively plan time-consuming and resource-intense real-world vehicle tests. Our models allow a profound analysis of an AEB algorithm by modeling and conducting more than 3,000 simulation runs with EuroNCAP's dynamic CCRm and CCRb scenarios including those with adopted USNCAP parameters. Results: Our structured analysis of such test procedures involving dynamic actors is the first of its kind in a relevant industrial setting. Several anomalies were unveiled under US NCAP conditions to support real-world test runs. Hence, we could show that the proposed method supports all possible scenarios in AEB consumer tests and scales as we had to timely process approx. 7.7GB of simulation data. Conclusion: To achieve the expected performance and to study a system's behavior in potential misuse cases from a functional point of view, large scale, model-based simulations complement traditional testing on proving ground.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313460","","Vehicles;Safety;Data models;Protocols;Vehicle dynamics;Trajectory;Systematics","automobile industry;automobiles;automotive engineering;braking;digital simulation;driver information systems;mechanical testing;road safety","large-scale evaluation;active safety algorithm;US NCAP Scenario;virtual test environment;industrial case study;European New Car Assessment Programme;active safety system;official EuroNCAP test protocol;autonomous emergency braking;forward collision warning;FCW system;vehicle-under-test;VUT;lateral position;United States New Car Assessment Programme test protocol;US NCAP test protocol;automotive OEM;vehicle performance;simulation-based approach;systematic large-scale analysis;vehicle test;USNCAP parameters;test procedure;AEB consumer test;system behavior;potential misuse cases;model-based simulation","","1","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the consensus notion, extensively investigated in multi-agent networks, is introduced in traffic control, and the steady-state signal control approach is presented, the idea behind which is that traffic states in network links asymptotically converge to given steady-state values, implying balanced distribution of traffic flows is realized. A signal control model of the network is first proposed, which is a linear time-varying system with discharging proportions of internal network links as control variables. Furthermore, analytic relation between steady-state values and inputs of the network is established based on matrix theory, based on which the steady-state signal control law is provided, balancing time-varying traffic flows in the network. At last, simulation investigations are conducted in VISSIM software, compared with fixed-time signal control approach in a real-world topological network in Beijing of China, which shows that the proposed signal control approach can improve performance indices of the network and then reduce local traffic congestion.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313175","urban traffic networks;traffic signal control;steady-state control;consensus;cluster consensus","Steady-state;Vehicles;Traffic control;Vehicle dynamics;Artificial neural networks;Cities and towns","linear systems;matrix algebra;performance index;road traffic control;time-varying systems","urban traffic networks;local traffic congestion;traffic flows balanced distribution;multiagent networks;traffic control;traffic states;steady-state values;network signal control model;linear time-varying system;discharging proportions;internal network links;control variables;matrix theory;steady-state signal control law;time-varying traffic flows;VISSIM software;fixed-time signal control approach;real-world topological network;Beijing;China;performance indices","","3","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These approaches can be designed to be complete in the sense that they converge to a feasible solution as sampling is made denser. However, they are not suitable to determine whether a solution exists. In this paper, we present an approach which overapproximates the reachable set of the host vehicle considering workspace obstacles.

This is a conceptual improvement on previous works which either focussed on a subtask (localisation or lane update) or only worked with single lanes. The problem is solved by applying Loopy Belief Propagation on a tailored factor graph which models the dependencies between observed and hidden variables. Message passing within the graph relies on multimodal normal distributions for variable representation and quadratic noise models resulting in a fast and well-defined calculation framework. Simulations show that the localisation accuracy is insensitive to most types of measurement noise except constant offsets of global pose measurements which can still be reduced by a factor of 8.

As application of GPS gradually increased, traffic managers obtain more and more travel data used by residents, which is more accurate, and problems by traditional survey can be avoided. However, the travel data cannot contain the transport mode and even a trip contains more than one mode. In this article, a new method for segmenting travel data into single-mode segments is presented. We analysis the position data of GPS area of Beijing, extracting the position journeys, then obtaining the segments and the segment points by splitting the position journeys with the interval time, extracting the features of the segments for calculating similarity measure distance of the adjacent segment based on Euclidean distance, analyzing the similarity distance, and last implement the traffic travel status segmentation-the transition point recognition. Our method can directly implement the transition point recognition before the transport modes classification. We have implemented the method and test it with the GPS data collected in Beijing.

These latter induce erroneous measurements that prevent the accurate estimation of the receiver position. In this paper, we propose to detect and discard these outliers in order to improve the localization. We propose a new algorithm to detect the outliers either in the pseudo-range observations and/or in the Doppler observations. Based on a model representing the distribution of inconsistent data, a criterion is proposed to partition the data between inliers and outliers. This criterion is coupled with a particle filter used for localization. Coupling is carried out in terms of selection of the data (pseudo-range and/or Doppler measurements) used in the particle filter. Besides, considering only GNSS data, the estimation of the instantaneous velocity (required for position prediction) is derived from Doppler measurements. An experiment with a GPS receiver on board a vehicle has been carried out on constrained environments, forest and urban canyon. Results prove that the proposed algorithm is both robust to the presence of 'outliers' in the raw data (thanks to the a-contrario detection step) and robust to non Gaussian noise and satellite blockage (thanks to the particle filter prediction step). Specifically, localization errors decrease of about 1/3 relative to the GPS receiver solution (also using pseudo-range and Doppler measurements).","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313497","","Doppler measurement;Global Positioning System;Estimation;Receivers;Satellites;Doppler effect;Atmospheric measurements","Gaussian noise;Global Positioning System;particle filtering (numerical methods)","coupling outlier detection;Particle Filter;GPS based localization;constrained environment;urban areas;vehicle localization;Global Navigation Satellite System;GNSS;non line of sight effects;receiver position;pseudo-range observations;Doppler observations;Doppler measurements;Gaussian noise;satellite blockage","","1","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If sparse sequences of coarse location data obtained from mobile users can be accurately map-matched to travel paths on the road network, then this data can be effectively used for several traffic-related applications. Unlike most other map-matching methods in the literature, we, in this paper, focus on the problem of map-matching sparse and noisy non-GPS smartphone location data. We adopt the widely-followed Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach and propose new probabilistic models for the observation and transition probabilities tailored towards the type of data being considered. Our map-matching method has been evaluated using ground-truth labelled non-GPS location data collected from real drives. Tests show that the accuracy of the proposed method is about 12% more than that of a comparable HMM-based method from the literature.

A class of models with minimal assumptions about distributions of bicycle parking stations and service requests is developed in which rational commuter behaviour is taken into account. Stochastic time evolution of these models is studied, using a generalised version of Gillespie's exact stochastic integration algorithm that accounts for non-Markovian inter-event times. The model is shown to reproduce quite faithfully the trip-duration statistics of smaller and larger real bike sharing systems, such as those in London and Pisa, including the algebraic `tails' of these distributions that are made up of longer cycling trips. The latter are related to user's difficulties to find suitable parking places therefore to a potential source of distress. The model also predicts other salient features such as a mode at 10 minutes and crossover behaviour at about 30 minutes. The framework can be extended to include measures either designed to improve, or anyway to affect, the user experience with a system, such as incentives for spontaneous vehicle redistribution. User satisfaction is difficult to assess in real systems because these naturally collect only data about trips that actually, and thus successfully, took place giving only partial and biased insight into user satisfaction.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.224","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313316","","Bicycles;Legged locomotion;Materials requirements planning;Markov processes;Cities and towns;Data models","bicycles;Markov processes;public transport","Markov renewal process;bicycle parking station;stochastic time evolution;stochastic integration algorithm;nonMarkovian interevent time;London;Pisa;public transport;bicycle sharing system;model-based assessment","","3","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The 3D building model is used with a ray-tracing technique to simulate the line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS signal travel distance, which is well-known as pseudorange, between the satellite and receiver. The proposed RAIM fault exclusion is able to compare the similarity between the raw pseudorange measurement and the simulated pseudorange. The measurement of the satellite will be excluded if the simulated and raw pseudorange is inconsistent. Because of the assumption of single reflection in the ray-tracing technique, the inconsistent case indicates it is a double or multiple reflected NLOS signal. According to the experiment result, the RAIM satellite selection technique can reduce about 8.4% of the large positioning solutions (points that estimated at the wrong side of the road) in the middle urban canyon environment.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313318","3D maps;Global Positioning System;Multipath;Pedestrian;RAIM;Urban area","Satellites;Three-dimensional displays;Global Positioning System;Receivers;Buildings;Reflection;Ray tracing","computerised monitoring;pedestrians;ray tracing;satellite navigation;solid modelling","ray-tracing technique;NLOS reception;none-line-of-sight;P2V communication;pedestrian-to-vehicle communication;Global Navigation Satellite System;receiver autonomous integrity monitoring;RAIM GNSS satellite selection technique;3D building model;pedestrian localization service","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, a pre-collision system usually makes decision based on distraction level rather than distraction type. Therefore this study aims to detect distraction in general regardless of its type, and proposes an effective machine learning algorithm, i.e., Cluster Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (CR-ELM), to detect mixed-type distraction in driving.

At these locations drivers may choose to perform one of many available manoeuvres. Early identification of the manoeuvre is important for the development of future safety and situational awareness systems. The objective of this paper is to develop a method for predicting which manoeuvre a driver will execute. To fulfil this objective a simple method based on quadratic discriminant analysis is proposed.

Independent applications of Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) and Ramp Metering (RM) have shown strong potential to effectively alleviate urban traffic congestion by adjusting the signal timings in real-time in response to traffic fluctuations to achieve desirable objectives (e.g., minimize delay at intersections or minimize travel time along freeways). This paper presents the problem formulation and the framework for addressing traffic control problem using an integrated solution combining ATSC and RM. According to that problem definition, an optimal closed-loop approach for ATSC and RM can be designed using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach. Authors' previous studies of MARL on a large-scale simulated network of 59 intersections in the lower downtown core of the City of Toronto for the morning rush hour have shown unprecedented reduction in the average intersection delay up to 39% at the network level, and travel time savings of up 2to 26% along the busiest routes in downtown Toronto.

Caminada","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","765","770","Computing the optimal route to go from one place to another is a highly important issue in road networks. The problem consists of finding the path that minimizes a metric such as distance, time, cost etc. to go from one node to another in a directed or undirected graph. Although standard algorithms and techniques such as Dijkstra and integer programming are capable of computing shortest paths in polynomial times, they become very slow when the network becomes very large. Furthermore, traditional methods are incapable of meeting additional constraints that may arise during routing in transportation systems such as computing multi-objective routes, routing in stochastic networks. Therefore, we have thought about using meta-heuristics to solve the routing issue in road networks. Meta-heuristics are capable of copying with additional constraints and providing optimal or near optimal routes within reasonable computational times in large-scale road networks. The proposed approach is a combination between genetic algorithm (GA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS). To evaluate our method, we made experimentations using random generated and real road network instances. We compare our approximate method with two exact algorithms (Dijkstra and integer programming). Results show that our approach is able to give high quality solutions within milliseconds even in large-scale networks.

Wang","NA; NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2580","2586","Energy efficiency is paid more and more attention in urban rail transit systems. Optimization on Automatic Train Operation (ATO) is important to energy-efficient operation of trains. ATO generates the recommended speed curve based on the railway line parameters, the scheduled time table, and the vehicle conditions. The control strategy of ATO makes the train running along the recommended speed curve to meet the requirements on precision of train stopping, punctuality, energy-saving and riding comfort. The optimization of recommended speed curve in traditional research does not consider the influence of the control strategy of ATO. The energy consumption calculated by such a recommended speed curve and the practical curve of the train operation have a significant deviation. In this paper, a more accurate model of the train energy consumption is presented by considering the control strategy of ATO.

The most common approaches involve the modeling of moving objects, through Detection And Tracking of Moving Objects (DATMO) methods. An alternative to a classic object model framework is the occupancy grid filtering domain. Instead of segmenting the scene into objects and track them, the environment is represented as a regular grid of occupancy, in which spatial occupancy is tracked at a sub-object level. In this paper, we present the Conditional Monte Carlo Dense Occupancy Tracker, a generic spatial occupancy tracker, which infers dynamics of the scene through an hybrid representation of the environment, consisting of static occupancy, dynamic occupancy, empty spaces and unknown areas. This differentiation enables the use of state specific models (classic occupancy grid for motion-less components, set of moving particles for dynamic occupancy) as well as proper confidence estimation and management of data-less areas. The approach leads to a compact model that drastically improves the accuracy of the results and the global efficiency in comparison to previous methods.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313492","","Vehicle dynamics;Bayes methods;Dynamics;Estimation;Mathematical model;Robot sensing systems;Computational modeling","image filtering;image motion analysis;image segmentation;mobile robots;Monte Carlo methods;object detection;object tracking","conditional Monte Carlo dense occupancy tracker;dynamic environment modeling;intelligent vehicles;moving object modeling;moving object detection;moving object tracking;DATMO method;occupancy grid filtering domain;scene segmentation;environment representation;regular occupancy grid;subobject level spatial occupancy tracking;scene dynamics inference;dynamic occupancy;empty spaces;unknown areas;state specific model;motion-less components;moving particles;confidence estimation;data-less area management","","10","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Distractive or Supportive -- How Warnings in the Head-up Display Affect Drivers' Gaze and Driving Behavior","S. Winkler; J. Kazazi; M. Vollrath","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1035","1040","Urban areas expose drivers to a lot of challenges (e.g., many kinds of distracting stimuli and road users) and critical situations, increasing the probability of driver errors. Therefore the accident rate in urban areas is quite high and driver assistance is needed. As part of the research project UR:BAN, this study investigates the effectiveness of four different types of driver warnings (+ control group), presented in a head-up display (HUD), to support drivers in a very critical urban scenario. The aim of these driver warnings was to alert drivers to a forthcoming pedestrian crossing the ego vehicle's road, eliciting a fast and strong response from the drivers like an emergency brake. The driver warnings varied in their strategy (attention vs. reaction oriented) and specificity (generic vs. specific). In a driving simulation the drivers' gaze and driving behavior were analyzed. A total of sixty drivers were tested in a between-subjects design (27 female, 33 male, M = 23.7 years, SD = 3.7 years). In general, all driver warnings affected the drivers' performance positively. Even though the number of collisions was not reduced, drivers showed a faster and stronger brake reaction when being warned, which nevertheless reduced the collision severity. While all drivers gazed at the safety-critical object, only about half of the drivers showed a HUD glance. When the drivers gazed at the HUD, the positive effect of the driver warnings on the brake reaction time was reduced. Thus, driver warnings which do not have to be fixated in order to be perceived are an interesting perspective for future research. Furthermore, the warning types differed little from each other in their effects on the drivers' performance. However, one warning, which was somewhat more unusual and difficult to understand, was least effective. This shows that a bad design of a warning can negate the potential benefits. Overall, the examined driver warnings can be recommended for very critical situations as they improved the drivers' performance and did not distract them. However, not all driver warnings are equally well suited.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313264","driver warning;accident prevention;driving and gaze behavior;head-up display;urban area","Vehicles;Brakes;Visualization;Accidents;Urban areas;Roads;Analytical models","alarm systems;driver information systems;head-up displays;pedestrians;probability;road accidents","head-up display;driver gaze;driving behavior;probability;driver error;accident rate;urban area;driver assistance;UR:BAN;driver warning;HUD;pedestrian crossing;emergency brake;driving simulation;collision severity;safety-critical object;brake reaction time","","2","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The article uses a Systematic Literature Review to assess scientific research concerning arrival times and thereby highlights gaps, trends and established evidence related to arrival times with HoS consideration in freight transport. Existing approaches formulate arrival time estimation problem with emphasis on: 1) feasibility scheduling procedures, 2) feasibility scheduling with routing choices, and 3) optimizing the total cost or total time based on relevant activities. Advocated algorithms are built on backward search line-blocking intuition when focusing on feasible schedules and forward search techniques (in the direction of the visits) when routing is considered. When routing and feasible schedules are both considered heuristic procedures are employed with the help of dynamic programming or restricted dynamic programming but also optimization procedures in the case of multiple dimensions. The review suggests that a 3% to 16% savings can be achieved if HoS are taken into account when planning freight transport.

Empirically, it has been observed that drivers do not compensate adequately for the changing grade resistance force at sags, which limits vehicle acceleration. As a consequence, congestion forms at sags. This paper proposes and compares the implementation of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Traffic State-Adaptive ACC (TSA-ACC), and Cooperative ACC (CACC) at sags. The controllers are implemented in a traffic simulation environment with a single-lane road stretch and a platoon of 200 vehicles of which 10% follow the movements set by the controller and 90% follow the normal driving rules. The simulation results show that all controllers reduce the travel time of the equipped vehicles and have significantly positive effects on the total travel time of the platoon. TSA-ACC produces the most travel time savings.

Previous research has pointed out that the individual risk attitude varies with different conditions. The traditional risk attitudes classification of dividing people into three categories, i.e. risk averse, risk neutral and risk seeking, cannot reflect the variation of travelers' risk attitudes. In this paper, we adopt the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) and propose a new risk attitudes classification by dividing people into five categories. Based on our experimental data, we found that the new classification can correctly describe the variation of respondents' risk attitudes when facing gain and loss and all respondents can be divided into different categories representatively and reasonably. We then set a CPT-based mode choice model and calibrated the model based on the experimental data. We found that the influences of the different risk attitudes to parameters were mainly reflected in the value function instead of the weight coefficient. Also, the graphs of the value function associated with different categories of respondents have been plotted to help the data analysis and the new classification has been verified that it can significantly improve the forecasting performance of the CPT-based mode choice model.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313238","risk attitudes;calassification;cumulative prospect theory;mode choice model","Data models;Calibration;Parameter estimation;Sensitivity;Forecasting;Analytical models;Predictive models","forecasting theory;graph theory;transportation","traveler risk attitude classification method;cumulative prospect theory;CPT-based mode choice model;value function graphs;data analysis","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, few recent studies have investigated the efficiency of SPSA for traffic signal timing optimization. It is important for this to be investigated, because significant room for improvement exists in the area of signal optimization. Some signal timing methods and products perform optimization very quickly, but deliver mediocre solutions. Other methods and products deliver high-quality solutions, but deliver those solutions very slowly. When using commercialized desktop signal timing products, engineers are often forced to choose between speed and solution quality. Real-time adaptive control products, which must optimize timings within seconds on a cycle-by-cycle basis, do not have enough time to reach a high-quality solution. Based on research results in the literature, SPSA holds the possibility of upgrading both desktop and adaptive solutions alike, by delivering high-quality solutions within seconds. This paper describes an extensive set of optimization tests involving SPSA. The final results suggest that today's signal timing solutions could be improved significantly by incorporating SPSA, genetic algorithms, and 'playbooks' of pre-optimized starting points.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313105","SPSA;signal timing optimization;genetic algorithm;heuristic methods","Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Delays;Computers;Vehicles","approximation theory;genetic algorithms;road traffic;stochastic programming;transportation","SPSA;isolated intersections;simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation;black box traffic simulations;traffic signal timing optimization;desktop solutions;adaptive solutions;high-quality solutions;optimization tests;signal timing solutions;genetic algorithms","","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there will still be situations in which drivers are required to take-over control of the vehicle, most likely from a highly distracted state. While highly automated vehicles would ideally accommodate structured takeovers, providing ample time and warning, it is still very important to examine how drivers would behave when they are subjected to an unstructured emergency transition of control. In this study, we observed how participants (N=30) in a driving simulator performed after they experienced a loss of automation. We tested three transition time conditions, with an unstructured transition of control occurring 2 seconds, 5 seconds, or 8 seconds before the participants encountered a road hazard that required the drivers' intervention. Participants were given a passive distraction (watching a video) to do while the automated driving mode was enabled, so they needed to disengage from the task and regain control of the car when the transition occurred. Few drivers in the 2 second condition were able to safely negotiate the road hazard situation, while the majority of drivers in the 5 or 8 second conditions were able to navigate the hazard safely. Similarly, drivers in the 2 second condition rated the vehicle to be less trustworthy than drivers in the 5 and 8 second conditions. From the study results, we are able to narrow down a minimum amount of time in which drivers can take over the control of vehicle safely and comfortably from the automated system in the advent of an impending road hazard.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313488","Controlled Study;Autonomous Driving Simulation;Transition of Control;Driving Performance;Human Factors","Vehicles;Roads;Hazards;Wheels;Automation;Poles and towers;Standards","automobiles;digital simulation;driver information systems;traffic engineering computing","unstructured transition timing;distracted drivers;automated vehicles;automated driving systems;unstructured emergency transition;driving simulator;transition time conditions;passive distraction;road hazard situation;vehicle control","","23","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, they have to do it at faster speeds than conventional mobile robots. This paper reports on an efficient technique to optimize the position of a sequence of maps along a journey. We take advantage of the short-term precision and reduced space on disk of the localization using 2D occupancy grid maps, from now on called sub-maps, as well as, the long-term global consistency of a Kalman filter that fuses odometry and GPS measurements. In our approach, horizontal planar LiDARs and odometry measurements are used to perform 2D-SLAM generating the sub-maps, and the EKF to generate the trajectory followed by the car in global coordinates. During the trip, after finishing each sub-map, a relaxation process is applied to a set of the last sub-maps to position them globally using both, global and map's local path. The importance of this method lies on its performance, expending low computing resources, so it can work in real time on a computer with conventional characteristics and on its robustness which makes it suitable for being used on a self-driving car as it doesn't depend excessively on the availability of GPS signal or the eventual appearance of moving objects around the car.

While this approach has been shown to work well on sparse and noisy data, the algorithm has a high computational complexity and becomes slow when working with large trajectories and extended search radii. We propose an optimization to the original approach which significantly reduces the number of state transitions that need to be evaluated in order to identify the correct solution. In experiments with publicly available benchmark data, the proposed optimization yields nearly identical map-matching results as the original algorithm, but reduces the algorithm runtime by up to 45%.

Especially for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and highly automated driving (HAD) there is the requirement of understanding complex scenarios. While prediction methods which rely on common kinematic motion models are only suitable for short time prediction intervals, methods which model the relation and interaction between traffic participants achieved good results on longer prediction intervals. A driving scene is defined by multiple surrounding vehicles as they are available from the environmental perception from long range radars of standard series vehicles. To represent and predict driving scenes with a different number of surrounding vehicles -- and especially potential hazardous situations -- we choose a grid-based approach. We introduce a novel approach to extract sparse features from driving scenes using non-negative matrix factorization. From the factorized and sparse feature space we determine the parameters of an auto-regressive (AR) model. Beneficially, the interaction between different vehicles is modeled inherently.

First, at every time step, a local 2.5D grid is built using the last sets of sensor measurements.

Future Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are aiming to assist the driving task in these complex scenarios. This can be realized by assessing the criticality of possible occurring situations. For such criticality assessment techniques predicting the trajectories of the involved traffic participants several seconds in advance is necessary. In this paper we outline a method that makes exhaustive use of context information to reliably predict maneuver-specific trajectories up to 5 seconds into the future. Since the evolution of traffic scenes cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, approximating future states in form of probability density functions will be of great benefit in terms of robustness and reliability. %Since, methods for approximating probability distributions are complex and in most cases computationally inefficient, We present an approach that is able to efficiently construct a discrete probability distribution by reformulating the problem as a probabilistic multiclass classification problem. The presented approach is evaluated on a real-world data set containing approaches to 85 different intersections.

In this paper, we present a novel, elegant approach to overcome this problem. Our approach is based on journey planner integration -- it obtains a fully multimodal journey planning capability by interconnecting, in a smart way, multiple incomplete journey planners, each with only limited modal and/or geographical coverage. The integration relies on a planning metagraph, a simplified representation of the underlying transport system which can be build with only a minimum amount of data.

An ideal law enforcement system must enable authorities to detect, identify and act against illegal road users with minimum disruption of normal traffic flows. This paper presents a new concept for in-traffic law enforcement that overcomes many of the limitations of existing approaches. The SmartRoad system combines the best abilities of imaging, automated identification, radio communications and artificial intelligence technologies to identify not only vehicles with anomalous identities but also anomalous behavior displayed by legal vehicles. The proposed system utilizes the combined abilities of traffic cameras and RFID to firstly detect vehicles and subsequently verify their true identity. Such information is passed downstream to enable the removal of such vehicles from the road with minimal disruption to other road users. As more historical statistics representing normal and abnormal road usage are collected the system will learn from such data in order to improve its ability to reduce both false positives and negatives. Successful deployment of the SmartRoad concept should therefore result in a self-regulating traffic system that discourages unacceptable road use and that adapts itself to new forms of road behavior.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313196","positive identification;RFID;traffic cameras;anomalous vehicle behavior;traffic law enforcement","Vehicles;Roads;Law enforcement;Reliability;Radiofrequency identification;Cameras","artificial intelligence;law;radiofrequency identification;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","anomalous vehicle behavior;self-regulating traffic system;traffic camera;RFID;legal vehicle;artificial intelligence technology;radio communications;automated identification;SmartRoad system;road transport;dense traffic environments","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some researchers have introduced text mining methods to deal with this problem, but they lose sight of the real meaning of the topics and some prior knowledge related to these topics which are important to efficient feature extraction. In this paper, we put forward prior Latent Dirichlet Allocation (prior LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based fault diagnosis. Firstly, Term Frequency &amp; Inverse Topic Frequency (TFITF) method is proposed to extract prior knowledge around fault symptom, which then is integrated into basic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to build prior LDA model. Next, we extract feature for classifiers with the prior LDA model from maintenance records. Thirdly, we give hierarchical classification model based on SVM and feature fusion method which are used for fault diagnosis. Finally, F-measure method is introduced to evaluate the performance of the proposed model with real data from high speed railway system in Guangzhou Railway Corporation.

The mechanism selectively turns the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) into a lower power mode while they are not permanently used during operation. In the first step, our approach allocates as much continuous slack time as possible to enter pretended mode by static scheduling. In the second step, further optimization is achieved by exploiting the varying response times of the CAN messages in different vehicle states. At last, an online algorithm puts the ECUs into pretended mode dynamically during vehicle operation. Experimental results of the first optimization step show up to 31.3% saving potential of the ECUs energy consumption. Additional 8.2% energy saving can be achieved by the second optimization step.

To derive RTV, time-varying speeds are defined for each street segment within a street network based on the historic traffic speed data. We generated a 5-minute travel time contour for fire and emergency dispatch centers in Seoul and calculated the corresponding time-dependent coverage areas for three time periods on each day of week. RTV index, which is unitless, has implications that higher RTV means that the region under evaluation has higher vulnerability to the traffic condition, while lower RTV means that the region is less prone to the travel time uncertainty.

Traffic-responsive control systems aim to make the best use of the existing road capacity. Here, we propose a model-predictive controller for urban traffic networks, where the goal of the control is to find a balanced trade-off between reduction of congestion and emissions. The cost function is defined as a weighted combination of the total time spent, TTS, (as a criterion for evaluating the congestion level), the total emissions, TE, and the expected values of the TTS and TE caused by the vehicles that remain in the network at the end of the prediction horizon until they leave the network. We propose a method for estimation of the expected time spent and emissions by the remaining vehicles, where our method is based on a K Shortest path algorithm. For the prediction model of the MPC-based controller, we use a macroscopic integrated flow-emission model that includes the macroscopic flow S-model and the microscopic emission model, VT-micro. Since the S-model includes non-smooth functions, it does not allow us to benefit from efficient gradient-based methods to solve the optimization problem of the MPC-based controller.

Accordingly, the driver's role changes to supervision, and - occasionally - intervention. For testing required solutions to support drivers' new interaction with partially automated driving systems, this study proposes an assessment framework, aimed for application early within the development process while using driving simulation. We conclude that the assessment aspects within the envisioned framework should be three-fold, i.e. assess (a) Situation Awareness, (b) Accident Avoidance, and: (c) Acceptance. Measurement techniques to test these aspects have been defined. Moreover, six traffic scenarios have been evaluated for their successfulness in creating different levels of difficulty in understanding and solving traffic situations representative for the interaction between partial automation and drivers.

First, a traveler tends to concern more with the prevailing situation than with long-term interests. Second, both traveler's psychological behaviors and route choice decisions are highly related to the availability and quality of traffic information. Third, evacuation instructions issued by management authorities may also affect the decisions of traveler's route choice. In this paper, evacuation route choice behavior is formulated as the integration of perception behavior on route cost and compliance behavior with the instructed route, which can be taken as the generalized model of the classical logit model. A fuzzy inference system (FIS) is adopted to capture the uncertainty and variability of traveler's perception on route cost by adding a dynamic weight to each link, which takes the level of traffic information and distance from traveler to link as two inputs. Macroscopic simulation framework is proposed to validate the evacuation behavior model using FIS. The case study shows that evacuation efficiency is overestimated by classical logit model, and relative low level and high frequency update of traffic information is recommended. In addition, strong enforcement of traffic management contributes to high evacuation efficiency but fully mandatory management is unnecessary.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313310","Evacuation;Route choice behavior;Fuzzy set;Simulation;Logit model","Roads;Load modeling;Computational modeling;Fuzzy logic;Psychology;Real-time systems;Fuzzy set theory","fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;psychology;road traffic;vehicle routing","evacuation route choice behavior modeling;evacuation route choice behavior simulation;fuzzy set theory;emergency evacuation;normal traffic conditions;traveler psychological behaviors;traffic information availability;traffic information quality;evacuation instructions;traveler route choice decisions;perception behavior;route cost;compliance behavior;logit model;fuzzy inference system;FIS;traveler perception uncertainty;traveler perception variability;dynamic weight;macroscopic simulation framework;evacuation behavior model;evacuation efficiency;traffic management","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is found that there exists decreasing tendency of transition intensity according to the number of lanes and the positive relationship between the intensity of transition and the amount of capacity loss. Moreover, accompanied by traffic oscillations, a series of capacity loss suggests the negative impact of oscillations on traffic dynamics triggering subsequent performance degradations.

One of the key challenges is how to accurately decompose the high-dimensional, noisy observation traffic flow matrix into sub-matrices that correspond to different classes of traffic flow which builds a foundation for traffic flow prediction, abnormal data detection and missing data imputation. While in traditional research, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is usually used for traffic matrix analysis. However, the traffic matrix is usually corrupted by large volume anomalies, the resulting principal components will be significantly skewed from those in the anomaly-free case. In this paper, we introduce the Robust Principal Component Analysis (robust PCA) for decomposition. It can mine more accurate and robust underlining temporal and spatial characteristics of traffic flow with all kinds of fluctuations. We performed a comparative experimental analysis based on robust PCA with PCA-based method on a real-life dataset and got better decomposition performance. In the real-life dataset, results show that through robust PCA most of the large volume anomalies are short-lived and well isolated in the residual traffic matrix while PCA failed. In traffic flow prediction experiments based on decomposition, it shows that the result based on robust PCA outperforms the PCA and simple average. It provide adequate evidence that robust PCA is more appropriate for traffic flow matrix analysis. Robust PCA shows promising abilities in improving the accuracy and reliability of traffic flow analysis.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313450","","Matrix decomposition;Principal component analysis;Predictive models;Robustness;Sparse matrices;Market research;Road transportation","Big Data;data analysis;matrix algebra;principal component analysis;road traffic","traffic flow decomposition;traffic flow prediction;robust principal component analysis;traffic data analysis;noisy observation traffic flow matrix;submatrices;abnormal data detection;missing data imputation;traffic matrix analysis;volume anomaly;anomaly-free case;robust PCA;residual traffic matrix;traffic flow matrix analysis;traffic flow analysis reliability","","6","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ensuring that vehicles coordinate safely while improving efficiency is, however, a very challenging problem as it depends on (i) the characteristics of individual vehicles (vehicle physics, sensors), (ii) unreliable wireless communication, and (iii) driving behaviour at a microscopic level, and their compounded effects at scale. The presence of non-communicative, non-automated vehicles must also be considered. Designing and evaluating coordination protocols requires a scalable simulation framework that is accurate both microscopically (to assess safety) and macroscopically (to evaluate efficiency). Standard car-following models, where position and velocity are dictated by local input stimuli, produce sometimes unrealistic behaviour when laterally changing position, and lack support for additional inputs. Furthermore, conventional environments used to model traffic flow are either too fine-grained to scale or too coarse to appropriately simulate control logic. This paper introduces RoundaSim consisting of (i) a traffic simulator using a novel approach of mixed discrete-continuous modes of time, and (ii) a framework for implementing car-following models that supports lane-changing and coordination protocols, with additional inputs from advanced sensors and wireless communications. We show how our framework can be used to implement and evaluate a car-following model with lane changes and validate that the traffic flow achieved approximates that of real-world highways.

Understanding where drivers begin to react to the curve is important for optimal placement of traffic control devices, such as advance curve warning signs, as well as other countermeasures. Time series data were modeled using regression analysis. Results indicate that, depending on radius of curve, drivers begin reacting to the curve 164 to 180 meters (538.1 to 590.6 feet) upstream of the point of curvature. This was compared against sign placement guidelines in the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, and it was determined these guidelines are appropriately set based on where drivers actually react to the curve. The analysis found that drivers begin reacting to the curve sooner for curves with larger radii than for curves with smaller radii. Drivers may not be able to gauge the sharpness of the curve, or sight distance issues may be a concern for sharper curves. It should be noted that the model only identified where drivers reacted to the curve. This research question did not attempt to answer whether the reaction point was sufficient for drivers to successfully negotiate the curve. It is also noted that sample sizes are small. Due to resource and data constraints it was not possible to model a large number of drivers over large variation of different curve types. Consequently, the results provide useful information but should be used within the context of the study limitations.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313453","rural curves;human factors;naturalistic driving study","Vehicles;Road transportation;Computer crashes;Safety;Data models;Time series analysis","road traffic control;signal processing;time series","curve reaction point;NDS data;naturalistic driving study data;optimal placement;advance curve warning sign;time series data;regression analysis;sign placement guideline;uniform traffic control device;resource constraint;data constraint","","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Variable speed limit (VSL) control is considered to be able to improve the traffic condition in truck-dominant highway segments. However previous research reported rather mixed effects of VSL controller on traffic mobility. While some studies reported improvements in travel time due to the use of VSL control, others reported either no improvement or small deterioration in travel time. In this paper, we demonstrated that the lack of improvement on travel time is due to lane changes that are taking place close to the bottleneck leading to severe capacity drop. We developed a combined lane change and VSL control strategy that recommends lane changes in advance to relief capacity drop in addition to VSL. Microscopic Monte-Carlo simulations on I-710 freeway with high truck demand were used to demonstrate that this combined control strategy is able to generate consistent improvements with respect to travel time, safety and environmental impact under different traffic conditions and incident scenarios.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313284","","Road transportation;Safety;Automobiles;Aerospace electronics;Microscopy;Monte Carlo methods","environmental factors;Monte Carlo methods;road traffic control;velocity control","lane change control;truck-dominant highway segment;traffic demand;highway networks;highway traffic mobility;variable speed limit control;VSL;travel time;capacity drop;microscopic Monte-Carlo simulations;I-710 freeway;truck demand;environmental impact;travel time;traffic conditions;incident scenarios;relief capacity drop","","4","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, an economical method for collecting headways and standstill distances is presented and applied to urban freeways in Iowa, USA. The following time headways and standstill distances were categorized into four combinations of car and truck pairs. It was found that headway values largely depend on the following vehicle type-when a car was following the average headway was around 2 seconds, compared to around 3 seconds when a truck was following. Additionally, the car-car combination leaves much less space when stopped than when a pair involves trucks. In particular, the average standstill distance of a car following a car was found to be around 9 feet, while the average standstill distances are around 12 feet when a truck is involved. However, both headways and standstill distances follow fairly disperse distributions, due to the heterogeneity in driver behavior.

A crucial step towards it is being able to read traffic signs along the roads. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art traffic sign detectors currently ignore the existence of additional traffic signs. Yet being able to recognize these is a requirement for the task of automated driving and automated map data updates, because they further determine the meaning or validity of main signs. In this paper we aim at the detection of these additional signs, a first step towards their recognition. We will have a careful look at suitable evaluation measures and then use these to compare our proposed MSER-based approach to a selection of five differing types of detectors from the literature. We achieved a substantial improvement of the state of the art with 90% successful detections with full sign content detection on a challenging dataset, while significantly reducing the number of false positives.

There are two modes in the controller. They are the H-infinity control mode and the uphill section mode. The H-infinity controller can keep track of the reference speed and position, but it will lose control of the train when it comes to the steep uphill sections due to the limit of train capacity. The uphill section mode uses full power of the train before the train arrives at the steep uphill sections and makes full use of the kinetic energy to pass them. But the train will be not on schedule because the position tracking error is enlarged in this mode. The tracking error correction eliminates the position error by adding a temporary increment on the reference speed. The upper controller detects the operation state of the train and decides when to change mode and make tracking error correction. The simulation proves that the controller not only has good speed tracking performance under gust interferences, but also keep the train arriving on time even if there are successive steep uphill sections in the line condition.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313387","H-infinity control;the steep uphill sections;multi-mode;hierarchical","Force;Error correction;Switches;Interference;Resistance;Dynamics","H<sup>∞</sup> control;hierarchical systems;interference;position control;rail traffic control;velocity control","hierarchical multimode high-speed train;speed controller;interference attenuation;H<sub>∞</sub> controller;reference speed;position control;kinetic energy;position tracking error;gust interferences","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional methods to calculate MNR consider the confidence intervals of multiple MOPs separately and hence are not able to control the overall confidence level. A new method to calculate MNR is proposed, which sequentially runs the model and recalculates sample standard deviations and means whenever an additional run is made until a stopping condition based on the Bonferroni inequality is satisfied. The overall confidence level is controlled by the Bonferroni inequality. The proposed method is computationally practical since it can be implemented automatically in most traffic micro-simulation packages. The proposed method is evaluated using a case study with multiple simulation-based surrogate safety measures, including time to collision (TTC) or deceleration rate required to avoid a crash (DRAC), and an empirical confidence level analysis based on a very large number of runs. Evaluation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method as it enables all MOPs at the same time to be estimated accurately at the desired confidence level whereas traditional methods do not. In addition, the proposed method is not conservative since it does not require significantly more runs compared to traditional methods.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.54","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313146","Traffic micro-simulation;simulation;run;replication;simulation accuracy","Safety;Standards;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Traffic control;Analytical models;Vehicles","statistical analysis;traffic information systems","TMM;traffic microsimulation model;DRAC;deceleration rate required-to-avoid-a-crash;time-to-collision;TTC;traffic microsimulation package;Bonferroni inequality;simulated traffic network;MOP;measure-of-performance;minimum number-of-run;MNR","","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Differently to previous models, it does not rely on indirect features like gap lengths, TTC or decelerations, but it models the lane change process by explicitly calculating the involved risks and benefits of the different trajectory alternatives. The lane change decision occurs by searching a tradeoff between the anticipated risks and the utility of the maneuver for the driver. In such a way, the model generalizes to a large variability of lane-change situations with varying number of involved traffic participants, since their states are incorporated into the risk estimation. We show that with our model, regular lane change processes can be reliably captured. We also show, how in complex constellations, the model reacts in plausible ways which are not covered by previous models. This is the case e.g. when an emergency lane-change is forced by a fast rear-end approach, or when a lane change occurs in anticipation to an expected merge-in at an entrance.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313376","","Trajectory;Vehicles;Frequency division multiplexing;Hidden Markov models;Roads;Acceleration;Cost function","driver information systems;risk management;road safety","complex lane change behavior;foresighted driver model;dynamic lane-change behavior;gap lengths;TTC;lane-change decision;trajectory alternatives;anticipated risks;risk estimation;lane-change processes;emergency lane-change;fast rear-end approach;expected merge-in","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper attempts to flesh out a complete picture of driving maneuvers on highways. Eighteen drivers participated in this study. They drove an instrumented vehicle on highways to accumulate 2,600 km naturalistic driving data. The data were segmented and classified into 11 maneuver groups manually. Analysis on the maneuvers revealed that: 1) A maneuver transition probabilities model was proposed. According to this model, 7 typical driving patterns were drawn based on the transition probabilities. Transition events pertaining to approaching/following/lane changing accounted for 95% of all the highway transition events. 2) The durations were 7.6/6.6 s and 7.1/7.0 s for free left/right lane changes and overtake from left/right lane changes, respectively. The numbers were 22.5, 21.4 and 16.3 s for far, middle and near following maneuvers, respectively. Statistical significances were found within both groups. 3) How drivers behave in each maneuver was analyzed. Drivers drove faster in free lane changes than did in overtake lane changes.

The results show a clear advantage for the former. The models show that the time when the frequency of crossing reduces to half ranges from1.7 to 2.3 sec after yellow onset.

Since the data needed to construct an MFD is not always readily available, estimating MFDs using a limited number of probe vehicle trajectory data with varied penetration rates is proposed. Subsequently, congestion control strategies are applied to the network and the MFDs are plotted for each control strategy. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to use the MFD estimated using limited probe data as an effective tool to monitor and control a network. The most effective strategy is a network-wide adaptive traffic signal control system, which decreases delays by up to 40%. Average fuel consumption levels decrease by up to 10%.

Giesel","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2568","2573","In the last decade the attractiveness of carsharing increased rapidly, not least because of the introduction of free-floating carsharing in 2009. In those kind of carsharing systems the rental vehicle does not need to be returned to a particular station but can be parked in any part of the operating area. There have been hardly any empirical findings on the use and effects of free-floating carsharing so far. Thus, this work presents results of user surveys (onCar questionnaire, online survey and discussions with focus groups) with customers of the free-floating carsharing operator DriveNow. Next to the analysis of the user the usage of such a carsharing system is evaluated by booking data of trips in Berlin and Munich from 2013. The Getis-Ord-Gi*-test is used for analyzing the spatial distribution of booking starts. The operator launched 60 electric vehicles in the fleet that makes an additional analysis for this special kind of free-floating carsharing possible. All approaches want to draw an informative picture of a typical free-floating carsharing user on the one side and about how this new mobility service is used in urban areas on the other side. By the discussions in the focus groups one obtains furthermore an impression about the acceptance of electric vehicles by the customers. One clear conclusion is that free-floating carsharing is mostly used by young well-educated people with an over-average income. Two main purposes of the trips are the way home and leisure time activities. The system is well-working in city or district centers while there are considerably less bookings in peripheral areas. This is also correct for electric free-floating carsharing that is principally accepted by the customers.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313505","","Cities and towns;Automobiles;Planning;Electronic mail;Graphical models","automobiles;electric vehicles;traffic engineering computing","users identification;electric free-floating carsharing systems;rental vehicle;DriveNow;booking data;Berlin;Munich;Getis-Ord-Gi*-test;spatial distribution;electric vehicles;mobility service;urban areas","","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Knowledge about interactions between different traffic-and transport related factors and their influence on the execution of transport is important in transport planning. The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of different factors on the performance of road transport. We aim to contribute to improved transport planning by analysing traffic and transport data obtained from different sources in order to support data driven decision making. Through a review of existing literature and discussions with a Swedish road transport operator, we identified factors that could be relevant to consider when planning a transport, e.g., related to weather, location of roads where the transport will take place, and planned time of the transport. As a result of variation in size, type and volume of the data representing these factors, suitable machine learning algorithms were selected, such as Decision Stump, M5 model tree, M5 regression tree, RepTree, M5 rules, and linear regression in order to study the data. Our experimental results illustrate the complexity associated to the performance of road transport systems mainly because of the dependency between the choices of influencing factors and geographic location of the road segment.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313565","","Roads;Meteorology;Predictive models;Vehicles;Global Positioning System;Temperature;Prediction algorithms","data structures;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic;traffic engineering computing","traffic condition;road freight transport;transport planning;decision making;data representation;machine learning algorithm","","1","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A simulation setup with known system parameters and an optimal centralized measurement fuser based on the Kalman estimator as the benchmark is used to numerically evaluate the different algorithms with different sensory track covariance configurations. The results of this experiment shows that sensory track covariance plays an important role in achieving a consistent fused estimate in a track-to-track fusion problem. It is difficult to obtain this vital information at the fusion center in a real world system due to certain practical limitations.

Active management of these energy sources can increase vehicle efficiency, longevity, or performance. Optimizing energy management is highly sensitive to upcoming power loads on the vehicle, but conventional control policies only react to the present state. Furthermore, these policies are computed at design-time and do not adapt to individual drivers. Advancements in cheap sensing and computation have enabled on-board learning and optimization that was previously impossible. In this work, we developed and implemented a real-time controller that exploits predictions computed from a dataset collected from other drivers. This data-driven controller manages a range-extender in a series gas-electric hybrid vehicle, optimizing fuel use, noise, and ignition frequency. The algorithm is scalable to large amounts of source data, and performance improves with prediction accuracy.

The purpose is to develop a low-cost alternative (equipment and installation), without compromising the process of localization estimation. The proposed method uses two GPS-receivers installed on the vehicle, disposed longitudinally on the cover (to maximize the distance among receivers) in order to estimate the Yaw and Pitch angles. To estimate the Roll angle, the proposed approach uses information from a receiver on the road infrastructure or on a nearby vehicle using V2V and/or V2I communication (compliant with 802.11p standard). Experimental results revealed that the performance on both absolute positioning and Pitch angle estimation is very high. The method is accurate in Yaw angle estimation enabling acceptable results in heading computation. Therefore the use of this algorithm in risk assessment on crossroads approaching scenarios, is achievable with an affordable setup. The Roll angle estimation can reach satisfactory results if there is a third receiver in the vicinity and in a non-collinear position with respect to the installed onboard receivers.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313498","","Vehicles;Antennas;Estimation;Receivers;Yttrium;Global Positioning System;Satellites","radio receivers;satellite navigation;vehicular ad hoc networks","collaborative vehicle self-localization;multiGNSS receivers;V2V/V2I communications;localization estimation;GPS receivers;roll angle;road infrastructure;Pitch angle estimation;yaw angle estimation;risk assessment algorithm;installed onboard receivers;noncollinear position","","3","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

NHTSA's NASS GES and FARS dataset were analyzed to determine scenarios and associated factors. Among the key findings are: 6% of total injury crashes and 13.3% of total fatal crashes were pedestrian/bicyclist related, which resulted in an average 3600 pedestrian fatalities per year, 570 bicyclist fatalities per year, 57034 pedestrian injuries per year and 43240 bicyclist injuries per year. Crashes involving older pedestrians and bicyclists (age 70+) often were more severe than other groups. More male than females were involved in both pedestrian and bicyclist related fatal and injury crashes, as either driver or road user. Most crashes happened under no adverse weather conditions, on dry principle arterial roads and at non-junction location. Daylight condition had the highest bicyclist crash rates and pedestrian injury crash rates while fatal pedestrian rates were much higher in dark but lighted condition and dark condition. Pedestrians and bicyclists were more at risk in urban areas in part due to the large number of pedestrian and vehicle activity in that area. Pedestrian were more likely to be killed in a crash between 18:00 and 21:00 and in cold season (during October to January). More bicyclist crashes happened in summer time. Before crashes happened, majority of vehicles were going straight, while more pedestrians were jaywalking/running and most of bicyclists were failing to yield. About 21% of total bicyclist related crash fatalities and 26% of total pedestrian related crash fatalities had alcohol involvement. This number may even higher since alcohol data are often missing. This analysis is quite valuable for design and evaluation of in-vehicle pedestrian and bicyclist detection system.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313342","pedestrian related light vehicle fatal crash;pedestrian related light vehicle injury crash;bicyclist related light vehicle fatal crash;bicyclist related light vehicle injury crash;driver's action;pedestrian's action;bicyclist's action;alcohol involv","Computer crashes;Vehicle crash testing;Injuries;Vehicles;Roads;Junctions;Turning","bicycles;pedestrians","United States;light vehicle crashes;NASS GES dataset;FARS dataset;NHTSA;dry principle arterial roads;nonjunction location;daylight condition;pedestrian injury crash rates;bicyclist crash rates;dark condition;crash fatalities;alcohol involvement;in-vehicle pedestrian;bicyclist detection system","","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Efficient Traffic State Estimation and Prediction Based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter with a Fast Implementation and Localized Deterministic Scheme","Y. Yuan; F. Scholten; H. v.

This paper proposes a traffic state estimation approach based on an improved formulation of the traditional Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), including a fast implementation and a localized deterministic scheme. A reformulation of the EnKF equations leads to efficient computation. The deterministic scheme implies that we use the same observations for each of the ensembles instead of randomized observations. The use of a deterministic algorithm can reduce the impact of coincidental sampling and associated sampling errors. Localization is in contrast with a global method. In the global method, both the evolution of system states and the incorporation of observations are considered as an entity (within a global matrix). Here, the inclusion of localization has several potential advantages for large-scale applications: blocking spurious correlations, decreasing computation time due to smaller matrix inversions, increasing the accuracy by increasing the effective ensemble size. The proposed implementation of the EnKF for traffic state estimation and prediction is tested and validated in a realistic Dutch freeway network. The experiment studies deliver promising results for large-scale practical applications.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.85","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313177","Traffic state estimation;Ensemble Kalman filter;SMW formula;Deterministic approach;Localization schemes","Mathematical model;Kalman filters;Covariance matrices;Accuracy;State estimation;Numerical models;Computational modeling","Kalman filters;matrix inversion;road traffic control;sampling methods","traffic state estimation;traffic state prediction;localized deterministic ensemble Kalman filter;traffic state forecasting;dynamic traffic management;EnKF equations;randomized observations;coincidental sampling;sampling errors;global method;system states;global matrix;large-scale applications;computation time;matrix inversions;ensemble size;Dutch freeway network","","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The business goals of the NAS' users flight and airspace restrictions, thereby operations more flexible and financially stable for those involved. During a CTOP, airlines can share their route preferences with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), combining delay and reroute. Considering that trajectory preferences will impact in the final sort to be assigned, how an airline could reduce its global delay achieving a better position to be assigned. Current solutions for this problem are based on Greedy methods. However, when a CTOP demand is initiated each airline might decide its TOS strategy without knowledge about other airline's flights. A Game Theory approach for single games (SG-CTOP) was proposed to improve the decision-making process. It was developed as an intelligence solution regarding the TOS strategy under involved uncertainty about airline competitors. A case study was conducted using real data from two airlines and 100 different CTOP demands called as SG-CTOP cycle. It was performed 100 SG-CTOP cycles to verify the SG-CTOP behavior by the time. The result analysis identified that when it was used the same strategy for every flight, after 100 SG-CTOP cycles the best strategy was to send two trajectories option for each FCA plus a NOSLOT option to fly around, regarding a maximum assigned delay to fly through the FCA. This strategy achieved a global delay of 53% less than NOSLOT strategy for every flight. When this strategy was compared with the proposed SG-CTOP model, Airline A would achieve a global delay less than, or equal, in 97% of CTOP negotiations representing a delay reduction of 537 hours for the airline.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313429","","Delays;Trajectory;Games;Airports;Aircraft;FAA;Atmospheric modeling","air traffic control;decision making;game theory;optimisation;path planning;trajectory control","trajectory option set planning optimization;collaborative trajectory options program;air traffic management;ATM;National Airspace System;NAS;flight restriction;airspace restriction;route preference;Federal Aviation Administration;FAA;trajectory preference;greedy method;TOS strategy;airline flight;game theory approach;decision-making process;SG-CTOP cycle;SG-CTOP behavior","","6","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The edge detection operators used for the detection of curb features are adapted according to curb models. With these adaptive operators road curbs can be found independently from their position and orientation in the image and the correct curb height can be calculated. Further we introduce a computation efficient grid map, which is based on a local linear description of the road curb in every cell and is able to represent the road curbs three-dimensionally. A chaining mechanism, which benefits from the estimated curb directions in the grid map, generates road curbs represented as 3D polygonal chains.

"Risk-Aversive Behavior Planning under Multiple Situations with Uncertainty","F. Damerow; J. Eggert","NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","656","663","This paper addresses the problem of future behavior evaluation and planning for upcoming ADAS, especially for inner city traffic scenarios. Situations in inner city traffic scenarios are generally highly complex and of high uncertainty. The behavior in such complex scenarios differs strongly depending on the actually occurring situation. In general the current situation can only be determined with high uncertainty based on current and past sensory measurements of the ego entity and the other involved entities. Additionally a situation can change very quickly, e.g. if a traffic participant suddenly changes its behavior. Here we propose an approach how to plan safe, but still efficient future behavior under consideration of multiple possible situations with different occurrence probabilities.

Members of a carpool face the daily challenge of deciding whether to go alone or with some or all members of their carpool, and further, to take their own vehicle or ride with others. These decisions may seem trivial in isolation but if not taken judiciously, over time, may disrupt the carpool. In this paper, we have designed a system which models daily carpool scheduling as a repeated stochastic game played among willing carpoolers which allows for individual choices and promotes carpooling as an equilibrium outcome through equitable payoff distribution using social credits.

However, estimating traffic flow rates from probe vehicle data remains critical. This paper attempts to estimate traffic flow rates by utilizing a well-calibrated fundamental diagram in combination with the traffic speed information obtained from the probe vehicle. Different single-regime fundamental diagrams and aggregation intervals of the probe vehicle data are investigated in search of the combination that provides the most accurate estimate of flow rates.

The objective of this study is to contribute to the ongoing research effort on hotspots identification. Employing the concept of natural neighbor, a new algorithm, named distance threshold based on natural nearest neighbor (DTH3N), is proposed in this paper, striving to minimize the aforementioned deficiencies of the current approaches.

The use of digital signatures for ADS-B has been previously analyzed in the literature. Our contribution and focus are devoted to the physical layer used to transmit such a signature. The proposed method generates ADS-B messages compliant with current standards, thus can be interpreted by current equipment. However, only a modified receiver shall be able to extract the embedded signature and authenticate the message. This work describes possible architectures for the ADS-B transmitting and receiving devices. An analysis of the expected maximum range and bit error rate for various PSK modulations is provided. In addition, the use of timestamps to protect against message replays is proposed and studied in the final part of the paper. In summary, this paper proposes a backward compatible way to secure the ADS-B system for the Mode-S ES data link, providing regulatory authorities with the means in case they opt for the use of digital signatures.

The relaxation time is assigned on multiple leading vehicles in the CACC case, whereas in the ACC case this relaxation time is only assigned to the direct leading vehicle. Numerical simulations investigate the effect of ACC and CACC to traffic flow macroscopic stability with respect to perturbations introduced in a ring road and to flow characteristics in open freeways with merging flows at an on-ramp.

An advanced control strategy is developed which only demands the axles of the converter dolly of such vehicle to be actively steerable so that existing tractor and semitrailers can be used without any further modification. The control strategy described in this paper allows the change of forward speed and even to stop the vehicle completely during the turning maneuver without any performance degradation. The controller utilizes the delays of tractor front axle steering angle and the articulation angles measured not in traditional time but in path-distance domain.

Rather than applying the global path directly, the proposed local planner will transform the global path into a normative path. Then, a generalized path corridor (GPC) is constructed based on the normative path. GPC defines the maximum free space along the normative path for local path planning. This avoids the local planner searching the entire space but still provides enough flexibility to deal with the dynamic obstacles. Additionally, a new type of heuristic cost is also proposed, which is measured based on the distance from the current location to the goal along the normative path. The integration of the normative path-based heuristic makes the local path planning more goal-oriented and helps the robot to navigate through the GPC and reach the goal more effectively.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313403","","Path planning;Splines (mathematics);Green products;Mobile robots;Collision avoidance;Vehicle dynamics","collision avoidance;mobile robots","generalized path corridor-based local path planning;nonholonomic mobile robot;dynamic obstacle avoidance;GPC","","1","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Accident Prevention through Visual Warnings: How to Design Warnings in Head-up Display for Older and Younger Drivers","J. Kazazi; S. Winkler; M. Vollrath","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1028","1034","Many severe accidents occur in urban areas. As part of the research project UR:BAN this study investigated how different types of visual warnings can prevent collisions within these areas and trigger the adequate reaction in critical situations. For this, two different warning types were implemented in a head-up display. It was assumed that one of the warning types should trigger an immediate and firm brake reaction of the driver (stop sign warning) whereas the other type of warning should animate the driver to be cautious, for example by slightly pressing the brake pedal (caution sign warning). As collisions in urban areas are also very difficult for older drivers, differences of the effects of the two warning types between older and younger drivers on driver performance (numbers of collisions, brake reaction time, maximum braking value) were examined. For this, four urban scenarios were implemented in a static driving simulator varying the characteristics of the critical object (e.g., pedestrian, lead vehicle, obstacle). In total 72 drivers (36 participants aged 20-35 years, 36 participants aged 65+ years) were tested in a between-subjects design (Age, Type of Warning). The study revealed that the number of collisions was reduced when drivers were warned (especially for younger drivers) demonstrating the positive effect of these warning types in very critical scenarios. If the situation is not very critical, warnings did not reduce the numbers of collisions, since the total amount of collisions was very already very low. In critical scenarios older drivers prefer the stop sign warning (leading to a faster and stronger brake reaction) compared to younger participants. This group had the fastest and strongest brake reaction when receiving the caution sign warning. In less critical scenarios both warnings had a positive effect on the braking reaction times for both younger and older drivers. The strongest brake reaction here was reached (in both groups) when receiving the stop sign warning. This study demonstrates the importance of design thoroughness when wanting to achieve effective warnings.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313263","Driver Warning;Accident Prevention;Head-up Display;Older and Younger Drivers;Simulator Study;Urban Area","Vehicles;Brakes;Roads;Accidents;Urban areas;Timing;Visualization","accident prevention;braking;head-up displays;pedestrians;road accidents;traffic engineering computing","accident prevention;driver visual warnings;head-up display;UR:BAN project;driver brake reaction;caution sign warning;pedestrian;stop sign warning","","1","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Direct measurement of vertical forces requires a complex and expensive experimental set-up, which is not acceptable for ordinary passenger cars. The main contribution of this article is providing a reliable estimator of vertical tire forces by using currently available low-cost sensors. The first advantage of the proposed method is that we modified the vehicle model to take into account the roll and pitch dynamics, which makes our estimator stay robust during sharp turning or at inclined road. The other advantage is that we proposed a process to identify the vehicle parameters, in stead of regarding them as known constants. This could enable our estimator to stay reliable even when the parameters are wrongly configured. The parameter identification process is based on recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. The state observers are based on Kalman filter. The estimation process is applied and compared to real experimental data obtained in real conditions.

A clothoid can be described using only its kink-points information, i.e. the points defining the start and end of a clothoid. Using the clothoid-based path representation, we formulate the speed profile generation as a convex optimization problem where the objective is to produce a smooth speed that is close to the maximum allowed speed. The vehicle and the road profile define the constraints of the problem. Furthermore, we develop a longitudinal controller by using the speed profiler in a receding-horizon fashion. Thus, we only consider a finite horizon when computing the optimal inputs every sampling time and, in addition, the longitudinal controller also takes into account the newest prediction available from measurements and from the lateral controller. We present simulations that demonstrate the ability of the method to generate safe and feasible speed profiles and the tracking of those by the longitudinal controller. We also study the influence of the clothoid-based path representation in the optimality of the speed profile obtained. We show that we can get a very good suboptimal speed profile approximation with few more points than the kink-points. In addition, we analyze the influence of an acceleration penalization factor in the smoothness of the speed profiler. The higher the acceleration penalization the smoother and the further from the maximum allowed speed is the speed profile.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313446","","Vehicles;Acceleration;Roads;Computational modeling;Optimization;Brakes;Vehicle dynamics","approximation theory;automobiles;convex programming;mobile robots;predictive control;suboptimal control","clothoid-based speed profiler;clothoid-based speed control;autonomous driving;optimal speed profile generation;longitudinal acceleration;lateral acceleration;geometric information;kink-points information;clothoid-based path representation;convex optimization problem;road profile;longitudinal controller;receding-horizon;finite horizon;lateral controller;suboptimal speed profile approximation;acceleration penalization factor;automotive","","5","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The basis for all these functionalities is the knowledge on the correct traffic light cycle time, i.e. the periodicity of the traffic light's signaling sequence. With a correct cycle time given, green start and end times can be derived from periodically reoccurring movement patterns. In this paper, we propose a method to reconstruct a traffic light's cycle plan through the interpretation of the recorded information on a vehicle's movement pattern (trajectory) in the intersection area. The recorded trajectories are temporarily sparse and and the cycle plan changes frequently.

OD matrices are a critical requirement, either in static or dynamic models for traffic assignment. However, OD matrices are not yet directly observable, thus, the current practice consists of adjusting an initial or a priori matrix from link flow counts, speeds, travel times and other aggregate demand data. This information is provided by an existing layout of traffic counting stations, as the traditional loop detectors. The availability of new traffic measurements provided by ICT applications offers the possibility to formulate and develop more efficient algorithms, especially suited for real-time applications. However, the efficiently strongly depends, among other factor, on the quality of the seed matrix.

Firstly, considering general characteristics of travelers' route choice behavior, all these pedestrians are assigned onto the road network via a traffic assignment model. Secondly, a nonlinear pedestrian road impedance function is introduced to address the congestion effects of massive crowds, and the pedestrian travel time changing rate is calculated for each link under various traffic volumes.

We use a database of real pedestrian trajectories to learn a model which is able to predict if a pedestrian will cross the street. Therefore, we first introduce a large set of possible features that could be suitable to describe the behavior. Afterwards, we perform relevance determination to identify those features that are necessary to reach the best possible generalisation performance. We provide experimental results on data collected at a pedestrian crossing in a city in southern Germany. Our results shows, that a very sparse set of features, which depends only on the pedestrians' trajectory, gives the best result.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313236","","Trajectory;Accuracy;Roads;Automobiles;Support vector machines;Hidden Markov models;Predictive models","estimation theory;pedestrians;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","feature relevance estimation;pedestrian behavior learning;crosswalks;automated driving functions;vulnerable road users;urban traffic scenarios;southern Germany","","4","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Reliability of Probe Speed Data for Detecting Congestion Trends","Y. Adu-Gyamfi; A. Sharma; S. Knickerbocker; N. Hawkins; M. Jackson","NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2243","2249","This paper presents a framework for evaluating the reliability of probe-sourced traffic speed data for congestion detection and general infrastructure performance assessment. The methodology outlined employs pattern recognition and time-series analysis to accurately quantify the similarity and dissimilarities between probe-sourced and benchmarked local sensor data. First, an adaptive and multiscale pattern recognition algorithm called Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is used to define short, medium and long-term trends for the probe-sourced and infrastructure mounted local sensor datasets. The reliability of the probe data is then estimated based on the similarity or synchrony between corresponding trends. The synchrony between long-term trends are used as a measure of accuracy for general performance assessment, whereas short and medium term trends are used for testing the accuracy of congestion detection with probe-sourced data. Using one-month of high-resolution speed data, the authors were able to use probe data to detect on average 74% and 63% of the short-term events (events lasting for at most 30 minutes), 95% and 68% of the medium-term events (events lasting between 1 and 3 hours) on freeways and non - freeways respectively. Significant latencies do however exist between both datasets. On non - freeways, the benchmarked data detected events, on average, 12 minutes earlier than the probe data. On freeways, the latency between the datasets was reduced to 8 minutes. The resulting framework can serve as a guide for state DOTs when outsourcing or supplementing traffic data collection to probe-based services.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313454","Probe Data;Loop-Detector Data;Multiscale Analysis;Empirical Mode Decomposition;Pattern Recognition","Market research;Probes;Reliability;Traffic control;Benchmark testing;Accuracy;Current measurement","pattern recognition;road traffic;time series;traffic engineering computing","congestion trends detection;reliability;probe-sourced traffic speed data;general infrastructure performance assessment;time-series analysis;probe-sourced local sensor data;benchmarked local sensor data;adaptive pattern recognition algorithm;multiscale pattern recognition algorithm;empirical mode decomposition;EMD;infrastructure mounted local sensor datasets;congestion detection;high-resolution speed data;freeways","","2","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach explicitly models these errors using multiple hypotheses in an evidential grid mapping framework that neither needs a classification nor a height of obstacles.

COSCAL v2 is a reactive feedback VSL strategy that resolves jam waves using shockwave theory. However, on-ramp flows (with or without RM) are currently not included in its design. When VSLs are activated by jams near an on-ramp, the additional merging flow can reduce effectiveness of the VSL scheme, by preventing jam resolution or even triggering new jams in the controlled section. The integrated approach improves effectiveness of the VSL strategy, and overall network efficiency.

In most cases these algorithms have to be parametrized by a parameter set in order to define the behavior of the control. The issue of selecting the best parameter set for a specific application or environment arises. The parameter selection is not a simple task since the internal structure of the control algorithm is often not sufficiently known by the user. Only the inputs (parameter sets) can be specified and the outputs (images) can be analyzed. This paper presents a generic workflow for the determination of a parameter set which achieves good image quality for a chosen application with specific light conditions. The developed workflow is able to deal with any control algorithm and any chosen application. In general, the four main steps of the developed workflow are: 1. Build a database of images with their related parameter sets, 2. Evaluate which image criteria are best to assess the image quality for the particular application, 3. Choose an optimization method, 4. Optimize the parameter sets. The presented workflow is developed and examined based on the example of real-world automotive scenarios.

This is performed in a Lagrangian formulation of the kinematic wave model with general vehicle specific characteristics. Unconstrained overtaking is presumed, which allows a demonstration to be given of the influence that constraints in traffic flow may have on the capacity drop. An experimental case demonstrates that bounded acceleration in traffic flow with unconstrained overtaking has very limited effect on the capacity drop. This implies that the capacity drop when incurred through bounded acceleration must make use of (semi-)constrained traffic flow, in which variety in vehicle acceleration ability may also be required to increase inhomogeneity. This is an important conclusion as it further defines the conditions required for capacity drop. The application of a Lagrangian formulation with advection invariant combined with bounded acceleration is also novel. The contribution further shows that the application of bounded acceleration in the presented model is feasible, although adjustments are required to capture the capacity drop through bounded acceleration.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313317","traffic modelling;capacity drop;bounded acceleration;kinematic wave model;Lagrangian coordinates;invariant advection","Vehicles;Acceleration;Mathematical model;Kinematics;Numerical models;Vehicle dynamics;Electric breakdown","road traffic;road vehicles","bounded acceleration capacity drop;Lagrangian formulation;kinematic wave model;vehicle characteristics;unconstrained overtaking;traffic flow;vehicle acceleration ability","","1","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, it covers small movements indicating a pedestrian's intention. A linear support vector machine with probabilistic estimates is used for classification.

In particular, the spatial distribution of each semantic category is obtained from a set of previously observed data. Then, such distributions, in the form of histograms, are integrated into the nonparametric labeling framework to guide scene parsing. Compared with previous approaches, our solution is very efficient in both computation and memory usage, since there is no complicated semantic training involved.

"Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Mismatch between Planned Road Infrastructure and Traffic Demand in Large Cities","J. Ivanchev; H. Aydt; A. Knoll","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1463","1470","As large cities evolve in time, the traffic demand and the road network adapt to the mutually presented changes by each other. As a result of this process, previously planned roads and intersections that were designed according to some optimality criteria at the time, turn out to be sub-optimal when traffic conditions change. This paper presents a method that can be used in order to identify intersections whose capacity is no longer in correspondence with the demand of vehicles on them and the choices agent make at those locations. Using real data from a survey describing the travel patterns of people in the city of Singapore we are able to model the routing choices of commuters and simulate the traffic demands on the road network. After calculating the turning probabilities on every intersection we are able to compare the traffic demand for every turn with the planned physical roads' capabilities. Furthermore we define a measure, which quantifies the deviation of the whole road network from the ideal demand-calculated values. We use these measures to evaluate the temporal and spatial profile of the mismatch between the roads and the demand for them. The measure is designed such that it is universal in nature and invariant to the absolute values of the traffic flows in the city. It can, therefore, be used to compare the proper utilization of road networks among different cities.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313331","","Roads;Turning;Cities and towns;Vehicles;Time measurement;Length measurement;Probability","data analysis;probability;road building;road traffic;town and country planning;traffic engineering computing","spatial analysis;temporal analysis;planned road infrastructure;large cities;road intersections;optimality criteria;traffic conditions;travel pattern;Singapore;commuter routing choices;traffic demand simulation;turning probability;physical road capability;citytraffic flow;road network utilization","","2","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Fusion of Carsharing and Charging Station Data to Analyze Behavior of Free-Floating Carsharing BEVs","M. Schüßler; K.

Beside other reasons one problem is the small range of BEVs. To overcome this fear of customers a sufficiently sized public charging infrastructure is necessary. Unfortunately, operating charging stations is not profitable at the moment because of the small number of existing BEVs and the high investment costs. This problem is called the ""chicken-egg-problem"" of electric mobility. An often mentioned sector which could guarantee at least a basic utilization of charging stations to a public charging infrastructure provider is the electric free-floating carsharing. In this paper booking data of BEVs in a free-floating carsharing fleet as well as charging stations data is evaluated to analyze to which extent free-floating carsharing BEVs are relevant for the utilization of public charging stations. Furthermore charging behavior of different user groups of a free-floating carsharing fleet is analyzed. Also areas are identified which are preferred for the installation of public charging stations based on electric free-floating carsharing. Due to these results the requirements on a public charging infrastructure in terms of size, type and layout are identified from the perspective of a free-floating carsharing provider as well as from the perspective of a public charging infrastructure provider.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.95","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313187","","Charging stations;Batteries;Correlation;Automobiles;Electric vehicles;Graphical models","electric vehicles;power engineering computing;sensor fusion;traffic engineering computing","carsharing data fusion;charging station data fusion;free-floating carsharing BEV;battery electric vehicles;electric mobility;public charging infrastructure;chicken-egg-problem;free-floating carsharing fleet","","","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Optimization-Based Clustering of Traffic Networks Using Distinct Local Components","M. Saeedmanesh; N. Geroliminis","NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2135","2140","Unpredictability of travel behaviors and high complexity of accurate physical modeling have challenged researches to discover implicit patterns of congestion propagation and spatial distribution in large urban networks. Spatial data mining and clustering allows to partition heterogeneous networks into homogeneous regions and chase spatiotemporal growth of congestion, which is crucial for real-time hierarchical traffic control schemes. In this paper, we develop and solve a binary quadratic optimization model for partitioning heterogeneous networks taking into account contiguity and size constraints for clusters. The proposed approach utilizes set of distinct and robust homogeneous components in the network called 'snakes'. In the context of this paper, 'snake' refers to a sequence of links created by adding new adjacent links iteratively based on their similarity to join previously added links. Firstly, snakes corresponding to all different initial points grow in a way that they have the highest possible homogeneity. Based on robust behavior observed in sub-regions with different level of congestion, we reduce the search space by selecting a sub-set of distinct snakes which cover different parts of the network. Secondly, a quadratic binary optimization framework is designed to find major skeleton of clusters from obtained distinct snakes by minimizing a heterogeneity index. Finally, a fine-tuning step is utilized to associate unassigned links, remaining from the first step, with proper clusters. The proposed clustering framework can be applied in heterogeneous large-scale real networks with fast computation to obtain low variance clusters.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313437","graph partitioning;congestion propagation;aggregate modeling;binary quadratic optimization;snakes","Optimization;Linear programming;Arrays;Cities and towns;Clustering algorithms;Tuning;Skeleton","data mining;network theory (graphs);pattern clustering;quadratic programming;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","optimization-based clustering;traffic network clustering;travel behaviors;implicit pattern discovery;spatial data mining;heterogeneous network partitioning;hierarchical traffic control scheme;binary quadratic optimization model;snakes network;heterogeneity index;clustering framework","","3","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Use of DSFS as a Speed Transition Zone Countermeasure in Small, Rural Communities","S. L. Hallmark; N. Hawkins; S. Knickerbocker","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1448","1454","Small rural communities in the United States are often located along major state or county roadways and as a result, most of the traffic along their main thoroughfare is pass-through rather than local traffic. Unfortunately, drivers passing through these communities often enter at high rates of speeds which are sometimes significantly higher than the posted speed of the local segment. High speeds create a safety issue for rural communities. They also discourage pedestrian activities, such as walking and bicycling, and discourage community interaction and vitality. Rural communities often lack engineering staff and resources to address speed management. As a result, rural communities find it difficult to address speeds and in many cases, utilize stop signs and lower speed limits to address the problem which may lead to disregard for traffic control. Traffic calming in rural areas requires different considerations than urban areas and within the US, rural traffic calming is in its infancy with little experience or guidance for agencies to draw on. This paper summarizes the results of a study which evaluated several different types of dynamic speed feedback signs which were deployed within the speed transition zone for small rural communities in Iowa (USA). DSFS have been used in a number of applications in the US, such as within school zones and work zones. Their effectiveness was less known in rural community applications. Three different types of DSFS were deployed (simple speed feedback sign, alphanumeric sign, and speed limit sign with LED array). All signs were programmed to activate only for drivers traveling at some threshold over the posted speed limit at the community entrance. Overall, the dynamic speed feedback signs were shown to be very effective in reducing vehicle speeds at community entrance. In particular, large reductions were noted in most cases in the fraction of vehicles that were traveling significantly over the posted speed limit at the community entrance.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313329","rural community;speed management;DSFS;safety","Vehicles;Light emitting diodes;Roads;Vehicle dynamics;Urban areas;Arrays","pedestrians;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles;velocity control","DSFS;speed transition zone countermeasure;rural community;road traffic;local traffic;safety issue;pedestrian activity;walking;bicycling;community interaction;community vitality;speed management;traffic control;rural traffic calming;alphanumeric sign;speed limit sign;LED array;community entrance;dynamic speed feedback sign","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these applications, we have observed that HOG feature computation is often a slow and energy-intensive component of the overall pipeline. In this paper, we focus on reducing both the time taken and the energy used for computing Felzenszwalb HOG features. We achieve our results though a combination of reduced precision, SIMD parallelism, algorithmic changes, and outer-loop parallelism. In particular, we address a bottleneck in histogram accumulation by phrasing the problem as a gather instead of the (traditional) scatter. Additionally, we explore the tradeoffs of using L1 instead of L2 norms to compute gradients, which enables smaller operands and more SIMD parallelism. Overall, we are able to compute multiresolution HOG pyramids at 70fps for 640×480 images on a multicore CPU. This is a 3.6x speedup over the best known HOG implementation and a 29× speedup over the popular voc-release5 HOG code.

This paper illustrates a model based approach to route guidance, where a model of the vehicle and the powertrain is utilized to calculate arc costs of a road network in terms of classical navigation cost functions (i.e. time, distance) and new ones adapted to electrified vehicles, such as energy use, and battery wear. It is also noted that the standard solution for the shortest path problem used for route guidance, i.e. Dijkstra's algorithm, cannot be applied to this problem due to the unique aspects of electrified vehicles, and another algorithm, namely Bellman -- Ford -- Moore, has to be utilized in the solution of this application of the shortest path problem. This is due to the fact that the condition of non-negative edge costs required by Dijkstra's algorithm does not hold for electrified vehicles which have regenerative braking capability. Moreover, it is also argued that most efficient operation of an electrified vehicle can only be achieved if route guidance and power management work in harmony, so that the best use of additional degrees of freedom enabled by electrification can be fully exploited. Finally, a comparison of this new method for route guidance to classical methods is carried out, and it is demonstrated that a weighted composite cost function that takes into account both classical, and newly introduced parameters generate a route that is efficient, and that also strikes a good balance in terms of travel time.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313372","hybrid-electric vehicles;vehicle route guidance;powertrain management","Vehicles;Mechanical power transmission;Batteries;Roads;Aging;Cost function;Meteorology","hybrid electric vehicles;power transmission (mechanical)","model based route guidance;electric vehicles;hybrid electric vehicles;powertrain;road network;navigation cost functions;energy use;battery wear;Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm;nonnegative edge costs;regenerative braking capability;power management;degrees of freedom;weighted composite cost function;travel time","","2","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The included driving manoeuvres are maintain lane, lane change to right and left, abort lane change to right and left, and emergency brake. A combined longitudinal and lateral driver model is used for the generation of longitudinal acceleration and steering requests. The behaviour of the driver model, both regarding heuristics and safety thresholds, is inspired by human cognition and optical flow theory. Traffic situation predictions of feasible lane changes are calculated using the driver model in combination with prediction models of the subject and surrounding vehicles. The traffic situation predictions are used for the evaluation of constraints related to vehicle dynamics, road boundaries and distance to surrounding objects. When the framework is started, the subject vehicle is initiated in the maintain lane state respecting the road speed limit and the distance to surrounding objects. A lane change manoeuvre is performed on request from the driver when the corresponding traffic situation prediction and control request become feasible. The framework has been implemented in a simulation environment including a high-fidelity vehicle plant model and models of surrounding vehicles. Simulations show that the framework gives anticipated results when initial conditions are varied. Results are shown for maintain lane and lane change manoeuvres at constant longitudinal velocity, varying from 20-80 km/h and lane changes combined with retardation including leading vehicle braking from different initial velocities ranging from 30-80 km/h.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.68","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313160","","Vehicles;Roads;Predictive models;Axles;Mathematical model;Acceleration;Vehicle dynamics","road traffic;traffic engineering computing","traffic situation prediction;optical flow theory;human cognition;steering requests;longitudinal acceleration;combined longitudinal-lateral driver model;driving manoeuvre;A-double long vehicle combination;emulated highway traffic;driver model based automated highway driving","","5","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traffic flow histograms collected at upstream links are exploited here to estimate downstream queued vehicles. The objective is to minimize the number of queued vehicles for two-way links between neighbouring junctions. It is a decentralized strategy and converges to steady states via iterative actions.

The spacing information is collected as secondary products from advanced vehicle technologies, such as automated vehicles. Traffic states and a fundamental diagram are derived from the probe vehicle data. Then, a traffic state estimator based on a data assimilation technique and a traffic flow model is formulated. This procedure is intended to mitigate negative effects in traffic state estimation caused by high fluctuations in microscopic vehicular traffic. The validation results with a simulation experiment suggested that the proposed method works reasonably, for example, the proposed method was able to estimate precise traffic state compared with the previous methods.

A CS consists of states and transitions between them, i.e. branches, and reflects possible situations but without specifying detailed behaviour. The pieces of data define what is included in a state and are a reasonable compromise between details and abstraction level but, in principle, there is nothing that prevents that other or more pieces of data are used.

This functionality layer is then verified by developing a real time autonomous rear end collision avoidance function by steering based on the reference framework. The motion of the truck is restricted within the existing lane, representing situations where there is a partial lateral interference by other vehicles, with safe distance to manoeuvre both in the longitudinal and lateral directions. Lane markings are used as a reference to guide the vehicle within the ego lane during the avoidance manoeuvre. Based on the traffic scenario and ego vehicle states an escape path is generated. A simple feed-forward and PD based feedback controller is used to track the generated path. Physical tests are conducted on a 6X2 rigid heavy truck to verify the proposed function.

Human acceptance and trust of an automated vehicle to transport people in traffic environments under different driving conditions is a challenging task. Perceived, as well as actual safety will play a major role in accepting automated vehicles. Perceptions however vary from one individual to another due to different reaction times, speed perception, and time constants during dynamical changes etc. The closer the automated vehicle dynamics are with those of a manually driven vehicle the more likely that the comfort level of the automated vehicle user will improve. In this paper we review these issues and discuss how the autopilot personalization feature can help to improve both the perceived and actual driving safety and comfort. We present methodology that allows automatic autopilot personalization based on driver performance models. The methodology takes into account driver's preferences for a particular trip and manual parameters fine-tuning by the driver.

The fine-grained activity recognition is to distinguish different activities between subtle changes such as walking with different directions. We believe a change of pedestrian's activity is significant to grab a pedestrian intention. However, the task is challenging since a couple of reasons, namely (i) in-vehicle mounted camera is always moving (ii) a pedestrian area is too small to capture a motion and shape features (iii) change of pedestrian activity (e.g. walking straight into turning) has only small feature difference. To tackle these problems, we apply vision-based approach in order to classify pedestrian activities. The dense trajectories (DT) method is employed for high-level recognition to capture a detailed difference. Moreover, we additionally extract detection-based region-of-interest (ROI) for higher performance in fine-grained activity recognition. Here, we evaluated our proposed approach on ""self-collected dataset"" and ""near-miss driving recorder (DR) dataset"" by dividing several activities-crossing, walking straight, turning, standing and riding a bicycle.

Firstly, different kinds of fuzzy logic models are proposed according to different intentions of assailants and pedestrians. Pedestrians are further divided into three categories based on their surrounding environment. Individual's behaviors are determined by fusing of recommendations of local avoid-obstacle behavior, regional search-path behavior and global seek-goal behavior with adjustable weighting factors, which are adjusted by the perceptual information obtained from interaction with environments in the visual field. Simulations in a hall with a single exit have been implemented. It is shown that the variation of the model parameters such as pedestrians' speed, assailants's speed, duration of attack and so on greatly influences the evacuation efficiency.

Our inhomogeneous horizon discretization allows to have a finer discretization of the typically important near future and a wider discretization of the less decisive far range of an MPC, while keeping a long preview horizon and at the same time limit the number of supporting points, hence limit the problem dimension, computational complexity, and proportional execution time.

"Efficient Model Predictive Control for Variable Speed Limits by Optimizing Parameterized Control Schemes","G. S. v. d. Weg; A. Hegyi; S. P. Hoogendoorn; B. D. Schutter","NA; NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1137","1142","This paper proposes an efficient model predictive control strategy that is based on the parameterization of a variable speed limit control scheme. Due to the paramiterization, the solution spaces reduces which leads to improved computation time. The parameterized control scheme consist of a speed-limited area in which a constant speed limit is imposed. By changing the position of the head and tail of this speed-limited area over time it is possible to change the density and flow in and downstream of this area. The controller optimizes the location of the head and tail of this area over time in such a way that the flow into a bottleneck or jam wave is changed such that congestion can be prevented or resolved. An advantage of this approach is that the complexity of the optimization problem does not increase with an increase in the number of variable speed limit gantries. The controller is tested using a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. It is shown that the controller improves the total time spent by all the vehicles in the network with 3.7% compared to the no-control situation. This improvement is realized by resolving a jam wave. It is also shown that the controller can achieve a better performance then other model predictive control strategies, when using the same amount of computation time.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313280","","Traffic control;Optimization;Vehicles;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Linear programming","predictive control;road traffic control;velocity control","model predictive control strategy;variable speed control limit scheme;parameterized control scheme optimization;second-order macroscopic traffic flow model","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Adopting Machine Learning Methods to Predict Red-light Running Violations","A. Jahangiri; H. A. Rakha; T. A. Dingus","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","650","655","Statistics demonstrate that a large number of crashes occur at signalized intersections due to traffic violations, specifically red light running (RLR). In order to prevent/mitigate intersection-related crashes, these violations need to be identified before they occur, so appropriate actions can be taken. Several factors such as vehicle speed, Time to Intersection (TTI), Distance to Intersection (DTI), age, gender, etc. influence the drivers behavior when approaching intersections. However, the driver-related factors (i.e. age, gender) are more difficult to obtain in practice. On the other hand, kinetic factors (e.g. speed, acceleration) can be obtained by monitoring the movement of vehicles through video cameras installed on the infrastructure or through on-board devices installed on the vehicles. Hence, the problem of interest is to develop models to predict RLR violations using kinetic information of vehicles. A monitoring period was defined to extract data from each vehicle before reaching the intersection. Machine learning techniques, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were adopted to develop prediction models. The minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection method was used to identify the most important factors for model development. To evaluate the performance of the models the K-fold cross-validation and out-of-bag (OOB) errors were used for the SVM and RF models, which contributed to high prediction accuracies of 97.9 and 93.6 percent, respectively.

An answer to this problematic lies in the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) approach where a map of the surroundings is built while simultaneously being used for localization purposes. However, SLAM algorithms tend to drift over time, making the localization inconsistent. In this paper, we propose to model the drift as a localization bias and to integrate it in a general architecture. The latter allows any feature-based SLAM algorithm to be used while taking advantage of the drift integration. Based on previous works, we extend the bias concept and propose a new architecture which drastically improves the performance of our method, both in terms of computational power and memory required. We validate this framework on real data with different scenarios. We show that taking into account the drift allows us to maintain consistency and improve the localization accuracy with almost no additional cost.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313526","","Vehicles;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Trajectory;Computer architecture;Uncertainty;Mathematical model","mobile robots;position control;robot vision;SLAM (robots)","drift integration;simultaneous localization and mapping approach;localization bias;feature-based SLAM algorithm;computational power;computational memory;localization accuracy","","1","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence an improved FastSLAM algorithm based on the strong tracking square root central difference Kalman filter (STSRCDKF) is proposed in this paper to overcome these problems. In the proposed algorithm, STSRCDKF is based on the combination of a strong tracking filter (STF) and a square root central difference Kalman filter (SRCDKF), STSRCDKF is used to design an adaptive adjustment proposal distribution of the particle filter and to estimate the Gaussian densities of the feature landmarks. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of UFastSLAM and FastSLAM2.0 in simulations and experimental tests, the results verify that the proposed algorithm has better adaptability and robustness.

This is called the capacity drop. Recent studies show that the queue discharge rate increases as the speed in congestion increases. For many applications, such as dynamic speed limit control design and evaluation, macroscopic models are needed. A kinematic wave model aiming to assess consequences of control strategies should firstly reproduce different queue discharge rates depending on congestion states, and secondly capture the capacity drop for both standing queues and stop-and-go waves. However, no such kinematic wave model exists until now. Therefore, this paper fills in the gap, incorporating the capacity drop into a kinematic wave model. The new model can reproduce different queue discharge rates corresponding to the vehicular speed in congestion, which means the new model can reproduce speed limit effects accurately. By formulating the model in Lagrangian coordinates and applying an upwind discretization method, this paper presents a hybrid model which captures the capacity drop with stop-and-go waves and can be applied to reproduce the capacity drop with standing queues.

Firstly, we extract kernel descriptor features from a given image in three modalities: intensity, depth and flow. Secondly, we dynamically determine the most suitable modality for that image using both: a modality pertinence classifier and a decision confidence indicator. Thirdly, we classify the image in the selected modality using a linear SVM approach. Numerical experiments are performed on the Daimler benchmark dataset consisting of pedestrian and non-pedestrian bounding boxes captured in outdoor urban environments and indicate that our model outperforms all the individual-modality classifiers and the model based on a posterior fusion of multi-modality decisions.

We present a method to predict and validate home and work locations of commuters using their public transport smart card data. Existing works rely on statistical techniques to interpret public transport transactions. Our method goes one step further by exploring the underlying repeated travelling patterns between home and work place. It first uses several features extracted from a card holder's ride records (i.e., the length of time that he/she stays at a location, the times he/she visits a place, etc.) to evaluate the likelihood of a location is associated with the card holder's home/work places. Rank aggregation technique is then applied to derive a comprehensive location ranking list. A few top ranked locations are picked out for further analysis, where the travel records between any two of them are arranged as a time series. Spectral analysis is applied on the time series in attempt to identify periodic travelling patterns. The most likely home/work pair is selected based on a proper period and dominant frequency which implies regular travelling activities between the card holder's home and work place. Finally, home and work locations are discriminated based on the assumption that a person goes to his/her work place mostly on weekdays and rarely on weekends. We apply our method on a three-month Singapore smart card dataset and evaluate the result against a ground truth obtained from Singapore urban planning programme.

Impressive demonstrations have shown the potentials of vehicle automation. However, many projects in the context of automated driving use a priori data in order to compensate insufficiencies in perceiving and understanding the vehicle's environment. Additionally, in terms of functional safety and redundancy, it is not yet known whether such localization-and map-based approaches are really path breaking. This is the reason why we focus on on-board perception also of the stationary urban environment. While object tracking is a commonly used approach, the combination of grid-based and object-based representations for environment perception is still a research topic. The sufficient perception of lanes and drivable areas is an unsolved issue in urban environment. Several perception modules have to collaborate for a suitable representation of the vehicles' surroundings. In this paper, we present the latest contributions of the project Stadtpilot to a perception-driven modeling of urban environments. We propose a lane detection approach which is based on a grid-based representation of different environmental features. Our approach is able to detect multi-lane structures and it is capable to deal with complex lane structures which are typical of urban roads. The extracted features are stabilized by a tracking module. Additionally, we incorporate a free-space representation which data is not derived implicitly from detected targets, but based on an explicit ground representation. Extensions of our dynamic classification module focus on the start/stop behavior of other road users in order to enhance the completeness of track list (mobile objects) and grid (stationary environment).

In this work, two data driven approaches are proposed to estimate train delays based on historical and real time information. A historical regression model is proposed to estimate future train delays at each station using only past performance of the train along the route. Next, several variations of an online regression model are proposed to estimate delay using delay information of the trains at earlier stations along the current trip, as well as delay information of other trains that share the same corridor. The proposed methods are tested with data collected on 282 Amtrak trains (the largest US passenger railroad service) from 2011 to 2013, which consists of more than 100,000 train trips.

Sester","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","2812","2818","This paper presents a procedure to extract parking statistics from a 3D point cloud recorded with two 2D LiDAR sensors mounted on a vehicle. Policy makers can use these parking statistics to reduce parking search traffic in cities by identifying parking characteristics and adjusting current parking rules and policies. The extraction procedure basically consists of an object segmentation and a classification step. For object segmentation, a region growing approach is used to extract the ground surface and to separate distinct objects. For object classification, a random forest classifier is employed with various local and global point features to identify the characteristic shape of vehicles. Comparing the point clouds of both LiDAR scanners allows the exclusion of moving vehicles from the result. A second segmentation in a finer raster after classification is used to reduce the occurrence of undersegmentation. The procedure is evaluated on a 5.5 km track including a residential and a commercial district with parallel and perpendicular parking in a large city in Germany. The results reveal reliable detection of parked vehicles in most situations and therefore approve its suitability for parking studies. Multiple statistics like vehicle dimensions, parking gaps and temporal behavior can be extracted from this procedure. As an example, the occupancy of street segments in the course of one day is presented.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313544","parking survey;parking statistics;vehicle detection;LiDAR;mobile mapping","Vehicles;Three-dimensional displays;Object segmentation;Roads;Sensors;Cities and towns;Object recognition","image classification;image segmentation;optical radar;statistical analysis;traffic control","on-street parking statistics;LiDAR mobile mapping;a 3D point cloud;object segmentation;region growing approach;object classification;random forest classifier","","5","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Micro-Auction-Based Traffic-Light Control: Responsive, Local Decision Making","M. Covell; S. Baluja; R. Sukthankar","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","558","565","Real-time, responsive optimization of traffic flow serves to address important practical problems: reducing drivers' wasted time and improving city-wide efficiency, as well as reducing gas emissions and improving air quality. Much of the current research in traffic-light optimization relies on extending the capabilities of basic traffic lights to either communicate with each other or communicate with vehicles. However, before such capabilities become ubiquitous, opportunities exist to improve traffic lights by being more responsive to current traffic situations within the existing, deployed, infrastructure. In this paper, we use micro-auctions as the organizing principle with which to incorporate local induction loop information, no other outside sources of information are assumed. At every time step in which a phase change is permitted, each light conducts a decentralized, weighted, micro-auction to determine which phase is instantiated next. We test the lights on real-world data collected over a period of several weeks around the Mountain View, California area. In our simulations, the auction mechanisms based only on local sensor data surpass longer-term planning approaches that rely on widely placed sensors and communications.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313190","","Optimization;Automobiles;Schedules;Roads;Data models","decision making;optimisation;road traffic control","microauction-based traffic-light control;decision making;real-time responsive traffic flow optimization;traffic-light optimization;local induction loop information;Mountain View;California;local sensor data","","4","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Urban perception - A cross-correlation approach to quantify the social interaction in a multiple simulator setting","C. Lehsing; A. Kracke; K. Bengler","NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1014","1021","In current driving simulation research, interaction between human drivers and the more or less smart programmed agents (bots) for surrounding traffic or vulnerable road users (VRU) under specific experimental conditions is the common approach [1], [2], [3]. But interaction between humans, especially in short-timed and complex situations like urban traffic, is a broad facetted, multi-directional and above all vital construct [4], [5]. Concerning this interaction the programmable traffic participants may run into constraints. This paper presents a method where the narrow spectrum of human-bot interaction is broken up. The apparatus consists of a multiparty simulator where a vehicle driver in a driving simulator and a pedestrian in a second simulator interact within the same simulated environment and encounter three types of crossing situations: free lane, occlusion and zebra crossing. Recorded data, (i.e. velocity) was analysed by means of a time-series analysis (crosscorrelation). This approach and the results shall foster the aspect of a more human-like behavior respectively human-human-interaction in a synthetic setting like driving simulation. Results show differences in the drivers' yielding behavior depending on whether the driver approaches a bot or a human pedestrian. Significant correlation between route design parameters and cross-correlational factors were also found.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313261","multiparty simulator;pedestrian simulator;driverpedestrian interaction;cross-correlation","Correlation;Vehicles;Correlation coefficient;Roads;Time series analysis;Legged locomotion","digital simulation;pedestrians;road traffic;time series","urban perception;cross-correlation approach;social interaction;driving simulation;vulnerable road user;VRU;pedestrian simulator;time-series analysis;human-human interaction","","3","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Towards Online Quasi-dynamic o-d Flow Estimation/Updating","V. Marzano; A. Papola; F. Simonelli; E. Cascetta","NA; NA; NA; NA","2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","2015","","","1471","1476","The paper deals with the proposition of a Kalman filter specification for quasi-dynamic estimation/updating of o-d flows from traffic counts, i.e. under the assumption that o-d shares are constant across a reference period (i.e. a quasi-dynamic interval), whilst total flows leaving each origin vary for each sub-period within the reference period. Drawing upon the effectiveness and the reliability of the assumption of quasi-dynamic o-d flow pattern and of the performances of the quasi-dynamic estimator in offline contexts, the paper illustrates a first formulation of a non-linear quasi-dynamic Kalman filter, which can embed diverse specifications of the state variables and of the corresponding transition and measurement equations. Results of preliminary tests on a synthetic network are presented, and the overall research pattern is also outlined, together with concerned research and practical perspectives.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-4673-6596-3978-1-4673-6595","10.1109/ITSC.2015.240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313332","o-d estimation/updating;quasi-dynamic estimator;Kalman filter","Mathematical model;Autoregressive processes;Estimation;Kalman filters;Context;Current measurement;Standards","Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;road traffic","online quasidynamic o-d flow estimation;online quasidynamic o-d flow updating;origin-destination flow;Kalman filter specification;traffic counts;total flows;reference period;quasidynamic estimator;nonlinear quasidynamic Kalman filter;measurement equations;synthetic network","","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
