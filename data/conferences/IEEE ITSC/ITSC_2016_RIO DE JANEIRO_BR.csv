A crucial element that affects road safety is driver behavior, because driver errors are usually the principal cause of traffic accidents. Therefore, understanding and modeling human driver behavior is extremely important for the safety of the road transportation. In this paper, a Fuzzy rule-based system to classify the drivers in different profiles according to their behavior is proposed.

Moreover, a comparison with a Jerk limitation algorithm for continuous acceleration profile and a smooth speed profile is performed.

Beyond technical feasibility, DRT needs to be based on prices and pricing policies that ensure the attractiveness of the service without compromising its economic viability. Nevertheless, there is little evidence on the conditions of economic viability of DRT services and on the cost structure of such systems. In this article, we use a strategic activity based costing model to analyze the conditions of economic viability of a DRT system in a Portuguese rural municipality. The case presented was analyzed in terms of costs and profitability. They were defined a set of important variables which should be taken into account in the design and economic evaluation of DRT projects namely, ticket price, trip distance and passengers.

The railway operator in Beijing, the Beijing Subway, is no exception. In order to improve the train operation to meet the capacity demand, the Beijing Subway is interested in understanding how the communication delay of the train-ground wireless communication system affects the headway. Appropriate evaluation methods are needed for this purpose. Therefore, in this paper, we firstly analyzed the impact of the wireless communication delay on train safety envelope. Then, the constraint relationship between the communication delay and the train speed is deduced according to the wireless communication theory and the IEEE 802.11 protocol, Rayleigh distribution is introduced to the relationship to describe the stochastic characteristics of communication delay. In addition, based on moving block headway calculation method, an analytical model combining the headway evaluation and the communication delay is derived subject to the train safety envelope. Simulation results show the difference of the headway between ideal situation and communication delay situation and the relationship between the headway and the train maximum speed under the condition of different communication delays, the conclusions can be used for the train headway optimization, the train safety operation and the transportation efficiency improvement in the similar environments.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795580","","Delays;Safety;Wireless communication;Signal to noise ratio;Rail transportation;Control systems;Public transportation","intelligent transportation systems;rail traffic control;railway communication;railway safety","wireless communication delay;train headway;communication based train control system;IEEE 802.11 protocol;Rayleigh distribution;train safety envelope;transportation efficiency improvement","","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More specifically, two different performance indexes including a relation between the number of accidents and the traffic density in a freeway stretch are defined. The solution of the control problem is sought by applying a derivative-free procedure in which two phases are sequentially adopted: a global search carried out through a specific version of the Simulated Annealing algorithm, and a local search performed by an algorithm chosen within an open-source library for nonlinear optimization. Some numerical results are reported in the paper to compare the two control functions and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795797","","Traffic control;Safety;Mathematical model;Accidents;Computer crashes;Automobiles","intelligent transportation systems;nonlinear control systems;road safety;road traffic control;simulated annealing","two-class traffic control scheme;freeway systems;freeway safety;traffic congestion;simulated annealing algorithm;open-source library;nonlinear optimization","","2","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Positioning error will accrete as train is moving away from balise. Not until the train passes through next balise group will the accumulated error be corrected. In this paper, integrated filtering approach is presented to online estimate the position of high-speed train. We firstly proceed the statistical analysis of relative range error defined by the ratio of correcting value to the link distance of balise. It indicates that the relative error conforms to the normal distribution. Then an approximate model is proposed for range acquisition, which can be offline and online identified by least squares support vector regression. Basing on the noise statistics and model of range acquisition, a linear model for updating relative position of high-speed train is proposed. And we use linear Kalman filter to estimate the position states, according to linear model. Thus obtaining the absolute position of train referring to the location of balise coordinate.

Sentiment analysis is one method of aggregating overall polarity (positive or negative) towards a topic. However, most sentiment analysis methods rely on text processing, thus ignoring the large amount of image data present in popular social networks. The primary aim of this study is to exploit image data in conjunction with text and to evaluate this integrated approach for sentiment analysis for transportation. This study used image, captions, and comments data from the Instagram social network that were marked as being relevant to California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and attempted to predict the expressed sentiment towards this agency. A set of high-level features were extracted from images using the web-based Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs. These features included the detection of faces and 86 categories which describe the images. Text features included the set of individual words and structural features. The experiment results of different machine learning techniques show a gain in precision when images and texts are combined compared to text-only approaches, thus confirming the relevance of visual content usage. The precision reaches a performance close to human classification agreement (typically approximately 80%).

Challenging are non-line-of-sight effects that are often present in urban areas. As those can hardly be modeled accurately, an unobservable position bias is often introduced which violates the estimated confidence. Therefor, mass-market applicable localization algorithms that mitigate their influence are desired to allow GNSS-based positioning for safety critical applications. With the beginning market introduction of high-definition maps (HD maps) by major map providers, another inexpensive tool to enhance data fusion based localization algorithms is available.

Due to the omnipresence of mobile sensors such as smartphones, real-world vehicle trajectory data can be collected at a large scale. However, most large-scaled mobile sensor data in practice are sparse in terms of sampling rate due to implementation costs. Before these data can be used in some applications, it is necessary to first reconstruct the data into high-resolution vehicle trajectories (e.g., second-by-second). In this paper, a probabilistic model for reconstructing vehicle trajectories from sparse mobile sensor data collected on freeways is presented. Prior probability distributions are used to quantify the statistics of different driving modes, e.g., acceleration, deceleration, cruising, and idling.

The dominant interaction between two closely-packed antennas is the mutual coupling. It causes difficulty in mass production. Mutual coupling introduces the impedance alteration. The tuning frequency is deviated from the operation frequency so that the antenna could not transmit the maximum power. If the deviated tuning frequency exceeds the antenna bandwidth, it cannot work normally. When the sensitive antenna receives in-band higher harmonic wave introduced by source antenna, it induces voltage which is unexpected interference. This paper analyzes the mutual coupling coefficient of multi-antenna. Some mutual coupling coefficient is more than -10 dB. In order to reduce the mutual coupling, a low-pass filter is proposed for 4.23MHz antenna and 9.032MHz antenna. The low pass filter decreases the higher harmonic wave interference. The simulation results indicate that the filter declines the coupling coefficient between two close antennas, which is less than -10 dB. It increases the antenna isolation and independence.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795879","RFID;railway signal;dual-channel balise;coil antenna;antenna interaction;mutual coupling","Impedance;Ports (Computers);Frequency shift keying;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Inductance","frequency shift keying;HF antennas;low-pass filters;multifrequency antennas;phase shift keying;railway communication;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas;wireless channels","multiantenna optimization;multiantenna interaction analysis;dual-channel balise;four coil antennas;tele-powering receiving antenna;FSK uplink transmission antenna;PSK uplink transmission antenna;programming antenna;closely-packed antennas;impedance alteration;tuning frequency deviation;source antenna;mutual coupling coefficient;mutual coupling reduction;low-pass filter;harmonic wave interference;antenna isolation;antenna independence;frequency 27.095 MHz;frequency 9.032 MHz;frequency 4.23 MHz","","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, ITSs are facing the challenge of real-time storage, retrieval and processing of a vast amount of collected data over a large-scale network. Compressed sensing (CS) is an efficient technique of sampling high-dimensional data and is successfully used to reconstruct signals via a small set of non-adaptive, linear measurements. Whilst CS has mainly been applied for data reconstruction, we propose in this paper the use of CS for classification and estimation of some meaningful parameters in the traffic problem. To this end, we develop a novel sensing matrix for congestion analysis and show that for traffic data collected in Melbourne urban network, our CS provides an opportunity to extract the desired information from a small number of random projections.

There are two main problems that will affect the transmission performance of SWM, namely the high local flow and low efficiency caused by high probability of sub-health vehicles (SHV) and traditional single channel and flooding transmission mechanism. Therefore a novel channel allocation algorithm based on communication demand matrix has been proposed in this paper. A new parameter, communication demand relationship based on health evaluation results is defined and communication demand matrix (CDM) is constructed to measure the transmission demand between corresponding vehicles. Then intra-cluster channel allocation algorithm based on the CDM is studied to effectively allocate the channel resource and improve SWM dissemination performance. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed mechanism has much higher ratio of fulfilled communication demand in the same time slots than flooding based on communication demand relationship (FD) methods in low, medium, and high vehicle density scenario. Beyond that, the proposed mechanism has better performance in receiving messages than FD and flooding.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795895","","Vehicles;Channel allocation;Safety;Receiving antennas;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Accidents","channel allocation;electronic messaging;resource allocation;road accidents;road safety;vehicular ad hoc networks","V2V channel allocation method;SWM communication demand matrix;safety warning message V2V transmission;accident avoidance;surrounding vehicle reminder;danger avoidance;intracluster channel allocation algorithm;channel resource allocation;SWM dissemination performance improvement;vehicular ad hoc network","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this reason, an exchange of GNSS observations via Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) is proposed in this paper. In particular, the European Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocol stack ITS-G5 is employed. With these exchanged GNSS observations, Differential GNSS (DGNSS) or Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) calculations provide a precise relative position vector. However, due to relative movement of traffic objects, this position vector becomes obsolete for increasing transmission delays. For this reason, a mitigating kinematic model is set up and validated experimentally.

While the processes of continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous experimentation using sandboxing technologies are becoming well established in said software-only products, adopting similar practices for the automotive domain is more complex mainly due to real-time and safety constraints. In this paper, we systematically evaluate sandboxed software deployment in the context of a self-driving heavy vehicle that participated in the 2016 Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge (GCDC) in The Netherlands.

Our results indicate that there is no significant difference in performance and overhead when sandboxed environments are used compared to natively deployed software. Thus, recent trends in software architecting, packaging, and maintenance using microservices encapsulated in sandboxes will help to realize similar software and system engineering for cyber-physical systems.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795942","","Real-time systems;Vehicles;Kernel;Containers;Companies;Linux","intelligent transportation systems;product life cycle management;real-time systems;road vehicles;security of data;software maintenance;systems engineering","cyber-physical systems;system engineering;software engineering;sandboxed software deployment evaluation;software-only product maintenance;software-only product development;continuous experimentation;continuous deployment;continuous integration;software life-cycle;data monitoring;self-driving heavy vehicle;real-time software","","1","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the context of rural intersections, methods that purely rely on the geometry of the scene are difficult to apply. In fact, the presence of vegetation and the large baseline between the cameras make the task particularly challenging. We present instead an approach based on vehicles' motion analysis on the main road, along with the generation of virtual lines joining the front wheels. We adopt the spherical camera model and use the assumption of planar motion. The approach is validated on a test drive field with a baseline larger than 13 m.

The objectives and constraints considered in freight train rescheduling are different from those related to passenger trains. For example, there is generally more flexibility in freight train scheduling regarding routes and departure/arrival times. On the other hand, freight trains have frequent unplanned stops for overtaking and acceleration phases use significant energy, especially for long freight trains. Therefore, energy consumption is recognized as an important cost factor in freight train operations and it is commonly used to help plan schedules. Energy consumption can be reduced by choosing energy efficient paths (less traffic, less gradient) and driving with speed profiles that improve route regularity (i.e., that avoid unplanned stops and minimize acceleration phases).

In this approach, traffic state distribution and data point distribution are used to describe the pattern of the traffic state. By combining these two distributions, a probabilistic traffic state model can be derived for a specific road. Using multiple pairs of distribution, the change of traffic state in one day can be described. The parameters in this model can be estimated from traffic data using Gibbs sampling algorithm, and once the model is determined, the traffic state can be estimated from the real-time traffic data collected from traffic detectors.

Building a predictive model for this stretch is a multivariate problem where the responses are the speeds/flows for different road segments at different time horizons. Considering traffic state short-term prediction as a multivariate problem ensures that all the spatiotemporal correlations are maintained. We adopt the deep neural network to predict the traffic state stretch-wide for up to 120 minutes in the future.

To overcome combinatorial explosion, we introduce heuristics to express the main influential parameters of the system, which itself is divided into two layers. First, we use a method called Design of Experiments in order to identify the most important parameters of general high-level system parameters. The low-level layer consists of fuzzy logic systems, which are the core of the driving style recognition system. For this, we introduce a way to efficiently describe the main characteristics of a fuzzy system by very few parameters. Both sets of identified parameters are then separately optimized with an established multidimensional evolutionary algorithm. We show that using Design of Experiments is superior to a random selection of the high-level parameters, as it increases the optimization gain by 76.5% in average. All in all, the target function, which represents a weighted classification error, was reduced by 43.9% on the test data set.

The described algorithm redistributes traffic volumes homogeneously around the city and converges significantly faster than existing methods for system optimum computation in current literature. Furthermore, as previous methods have mainly been developed for theoretical purposes, the solutions provided by them do not contain all the necessary information for a practical implementation such as explicit paths for the commuting population. In contrast, the BISOS algorithm preserves the information about the exact paths of all commuters, throughout the whole process of computing the system optimum assignment. Furthermore, a realistic traffic scenario is simulated using Singapore as a case study by utilizing survey and GPS traffic data.

Drivers are the key interaction parts between the FCATs and vehicles, which play an important role in the performance evaluation. This paper proposes a practical method to evaluate the performance of FCATs by using a novel driver hazard perception measure, namely driver's risk response time. This measure describes the driver's awareness of potential collision risk, which is defined based on the Time-to-collision (TTC) and driver's brake response in a near-crash scenario. A two-month naturalistic driving experiment has been conducted using a vehicle equipped with one FCAT, i.e., Collision Mitigation Brake System (CMBS). An interval-based cumulative frequency data pretreatment method is used to extract near-crashes. Then, the hazard perception measure is computed in near-crashes with CMBS on and off, which can show the effectiveness of CMBS. The results demonstrate that CMBS is highly-positive in improving driver's hazard perception, especially in speed range between 45 km/h and 60 km/h. This fact is consistent with the expected effect of CMBS, which shows the proposed measure for hazard perception is capable of describing drivers' awareness of collision risk. In addition, this measure is applicable to assess the performance of FCATs during the function designing stage.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795923","","Vehicles;Hazards;Computer crashes;Brakes;Roads;Databases","collision avoidance;intelligent transportation systems;road accidents;road safety","forward collision avoidance system;driver hazard perception;driver risk response time;time-to-collision;driver brake response;collision mitigation brake system","","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we assume that during an emergency there are traffic police or other personnel trying to guide the vehicles so that the traffic clearance is sped up (to minimize the human or property losses). However each individual driver agent has its own motives and biases that may slowdown such a clearing up of traffic. In particular, we assume that the traffic police use the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm to maximize the flow in the (traffic) network and then perform an extensive agent based analysis to study the traffic patterns that arise due to a variety of human factors and biases. Through a series of experiments performed using the well-known traffic simulator SUMO we could show that: (a) Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is indeed efficient for clearance of vehicles in such settings (b) Driver agents that do not follow the directions due to their preferences and biases lose out on an average and (c) As can be expected, having more information about the environment available via prior knowledge and/or real-time updates can offset the effect of biases to a good extent.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795888","","Vehicles;Law enforcement;Real-time systems;Roads;Vehicle dynamics;Planning;Databases","emergency management;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic control","human behavior;traffic patterns;emergency situation;Ford-Fulkerson algorithm;SUMO traffic simulator;traffic flow","","1","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel registration algorithm based on Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) is proposed. First, the state space model (SSM) regarding two point sets with Gaussian noise is formulated. Then CKF and simulated annealing based algorithm is utilized to optimize the process recursively. Since point set registration problem in SLAM application is mainly 3D, algorithm proposed in this paper focuses on 3D rigid point set registration problem. Compared to classical method, like Iterative Closest Point (ICP), CKF based method is more robust to noise and outliers. Besides that, this algorithm does not depend much on proper initialization which is very important to ICP. In order to explore the state space more efficiently, continuous simulated annealing is used on the process noise. Compared to Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based registration algorithm, this algorithm can improve precision of approximating nonlinearity in measurement update.

As it is overwhelming to program the action rules case-by-case, a unified planning framework under uncertainty is proposed in this paper, which achieves a non-conservatively defensive strategy (NCDS) in various kinds of scenarios for urban autonomous driving. First, uncertainties in urban scenarios are simplified to two probabilistic cases, namely passing and yielding. Two-way-stop intersection is used as an exemplar scenario to illustrate the derivation of probabilities for different intentions of others via a logistic regression model. Then a deterministic planner is designed as the baseline. Also, a safe set is defined, which considers both current and preview safety. The planning framework under uncertainty is then proposed, in which safety is guaranteed and overcautious behavior is prevented. Finally, the proposed planning framework is tested by simulation in the exemplar scenario, which demonstrates that an NCDS can be realistically achieved by employing the proposed framework.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795595","","Autonomous vehicles;Uncertainty;Planning;Roads;Safety;Automobiles","intelligent transportation systems;road traffic control","urban autonomous driving;nonconservatively defensive strategy;two-way-stop intersection","","16","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, such events are rare cases in the naturalistic driving data. Manual annotation is usually required to extract such events from a large data set. This study investigates the idea of using drivers' physiological signals to help with the manual annotation process. The proposed framework uses the unsupervised cluster algorithm, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), to cluster the physiological data into three classes: “Normal”, “Event” and “Noise”. We define three types of driver behavior events of interest in our real-world driving data, and evaluate the recall rate using the data classified in the “Event” cluster. High recall rate at 75% is achieved on average.

Statistical analysis is conducted on each cluster to derive the acceleration distribution, resulting in different driving models. Secondly, supervised learning classification technique (i.e., Fuzzy k-NN) is applied to obtain the model/cluster of a given driving scenario. Using the derived model with the associated acceleration distribution, Kalman filter/prediction is applied to obtain vehicle states and their projection.

The implementation of traffic monitoring systems, however, requires a considerable amount of investment in equipment and qualified personnel to simply get data. Investments are even greater when it is necessary to process and analyze the data and produce information that supports operational measures, public policies, and investments in infrastructure.

In this paper, we propose a concept for detecting vehicle behaviour. This approach consists of a fuzzy logic combined with a Markov Model. The input data comprise dynamic states (e.g. velocity and acceleration) of the vehicles as well as context information represented by an interaction graph. The behaviour recognition covers the host vehicle as well as surrounding vehicles. Evaluation is carried out using the experimental car ""Leonie"".

To take the full advantages of both technologies features, this paper studies and demonstrate the proposal of using VLC for information exchange among the platoon members and LRF for inter-vehicle distance estimation. A hand-over algorithm is proposed to manage the switching process for any failure occurrence by assessing LRF and VLC performance using three different metrics: LRF confidence value, vehicles angular orientation, and the VLC link latency. The evaluation of the proposed system is verified using VLC prototype and Pro- SiVIC Simulator driving platoon of two autonomous vehicles over different curvature scenarios. Our results show that the proposed combination are extending the VLC limitations and satisfying the platooning requirement.

This is especially true for merge manoeuvres into dense traffic, where drivers sometimes must be somewhat aggressive and show the intention of merging in order to interact with the other driver and make the driver open the gap needed to execute the manoeuvre safely. Many motion planning frameworks for autonomous vehicles adopt a reactive approach where simple models of other traffic participants are used and therefore need to adhere to large margins in order to behave safely. However, the large margins needed can sometimes get the system stuck in congested traffic where time gaps between vehicles are too small. In other situations, such as a highway merge, it can be significantly more dangerous to stop on the entrance ramp if the gaps are found to be too small than to make a slightly more aggressive manoeuvre and let the driver behind open the gap needed. To remedy this problem, this work uses the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) to explicitly model the interaction of other drivers and evaluates the risk by their required deceleration in a similar manner as the Minimum Overall Breaking Induced by Lane change (MOBIL) model that has been used in large scale traffic simulations before. This allows the algorithm to evaluate the effect on other drivers depending on our own trajectory plans by simulating the nearby traffic situation. Finding a globally optimal solution is often intractable in these situations so instead a large set of candidate trajectories are generated that are evaluated against the traffic scene by forward simulations of other traffic participants. By discretization and using an efficient trajectory generator together with efficient modelling of the traffic scene real-time demands can be met.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795596","","Trajectory;Vehicles;Planning;Acceleration;Predictive models;Roads;Merging","intelligent transportation systems;path planning;risk management;road traffic control;trajectory control","trajectory planning;merge scenario;traffic congestion;motion planning;intelligent driver model;IDM;driver interaction modelling;risk evaluation","","3","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead of designing an algorithm for a single one of various potential subproblems, two interfaces are presented, called static and dynamic events, that are capable of representing any situation along the chosen lane of the autonomous vehicle. This allows fast, analytic calculation of Inevitable Collision States which are used as heuristic to realize a guided A* search. Instead of being limited to a small, finite set of maneuvers as rule-based driving strategies like state machines are, the algorithm selects the optimal of an infinite number of possible, implicit maneuvers. The presented algorithm has a worst-case runtime of 80 ms for a planning horizon of 13 seconds and is therefore capable of running online.

However, the safety improvement of the current V2V systems only benefits V2V-enabled objects in the V2V network. The Pedestrian Automatic Emergency Braking System (PAEB) can utilize onboard sensors to detect pedestrians and make safety related actions so it benefits the individual vehicle and the pedestrians detected by its PAEB. To further improve pedestrian safety, the idea for integrating the capabilities of V2V and PAEB (V2V-PAEB) has been proposed, which allows the information of pedestrians detected by onboard sensors of a vehicle to be shared in the V2V network. A V2V-PAEB enabled vehicle uses not only its onboard sensors, but also received V2V messages from others to detect potential collisions with pedestrians and make better safety related decisions. In this paper, a Matlab/Simulink based simulation model of V2V-PAEB system is presented for demonstrating the proper architecture and information processing processes, and for providing the quick start of developing a better simulation model of V2V-PAEB.

We describe one such modular control algorithm, based upon a two-layer architecture that separates the hardware control from the material flow control. Our modular control algorithm allows predefined modules for both the conveyor hardware and material flow elements to be created and then assembled in the needed configuration. As a result, the control software for a custom-built material handling system can be created by arranging predefined modules and setting their parameters, thus without manual programming.

We focus on the simultaneous prediction of traffic and parking availability. Our approach relay on machine learning techniques and more precisely on representation learning methods: each road and car-park is represented by a vector in a common large dimensional space which captures both structural and dynamical information about the observed phenomenon. Such a model is thus able to jointly capture the spatio-temporal correlations between parking and traffic resulting in a high performance prediction system.

Autonomous vehicles, most of which currently employ laser and image sensors, are required to have systems for object detection, obstacle avoidance, navigation etc. The one of the most important pieces of information for these systems is an accurate dense 3D depth map. However, range data is much sparser than image data, thus the challenging problem is to reconstruct a dense depth map using sparse range and image data. Here we propose a novel approach to fuse these different types of sensor data to reconstruct 3D scenes which maintains the shape of local objects. Our method features two main phases: the local range modeling phase and 3D depth map reconstruction phase. In the local range modeling phase we interpolate 3D points from the laser scanner using Gaussian Process regression. It estimates 3D measurements across the outdoor environment and accommodates for defective sensor information. In the reconstruction phase, we fuse an image and interpolated points to build a 3D depth map and optimize based on a Markov Random Field. It provides a depth map corresponding to all image pixels. Qualitative and time complexity results show that our approach is robust and fast enough to demonstrate in real-time for an autonomous vehicle in complex urban scenes.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795619","","Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Histograms;Autonomous vehicles;Cameras;Real-time systems;Lasers","Gaussian processes;image fusion;image reconstruction;intelligent transportation systems;interpolation;Markov processes;optical scanners;regression analysis;road traffic control","3D scene reconstruction;autonomous vehicle driving;sparse laser scanner;single camera;outdoor autonomous vehicle;outdoor environments;local range modeling phase;3D depth map reconstruction phase;Gaussian process regression;image fusion;3D point interpolation;Markov random field;urban scenes;complex urban scenes","","2","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With tracking, an ego-vehicle can make a prediction about the location of surrounding objects in the next time epoch and plan for next actions. Object tracking algorithms typically rely on sensory data (from RGB cameras or LIDAR). In fact, the integration of 2D-RGB camera images and 3D-LIDAR data can provide some distinct benefits. This paper proposes a 3D object tracking algorithm using a 3D-LIDAR, an RGB camera and INS (GPS/IMU) sensors data by analyzing sequential 2D-RGB, 3D point-cloud, and the ego-vehicle's localization data and outputs the trajectory of the tracked object, an estimation of its current velocity, and its predicted location in the 3D world coordinate system in the next time-step. Tracking starts with a known initial 3D bounding box for the object. Two parallel mean-shift algorithms are applied for object detection and localization in the 2D image and 3D point-cloud, followed by a robust 2D/3D Kalman filter based fusion and tracking. Reported results, from both quantitative and qualitative experiments using the KITTI database demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach in driving environments.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795718","","Three-dimensional displays;Object tracking;Cameras;Image color analysis;Two dimensional displays;Laser radar","cameras;Global Positioning System;image filtering;image fusion;image sensors;Kalman filters;object tracking;optical radar","3D object tracking algorithm;autonomous car perception system;ADAS perception system;2D-RGB camera imaging;3D-LIDAR data;INS;GPS-IMU;sensor data;3D point-cloud analysis;ego-vehicle localization data analysis;3D world coordinate system;parallel mean-shift algorithm;robust 2D-3D Kalman filter;KITTI database;current velocity estimation","","2","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, in this study we propose GoTogether, a recommender system for car pooling services that leverages on learning-to-rank techniques to automatically derive the personalised ranking model of each user from the history of her choices (i.e., the type of accepted or rejected shared rides). Then, GoTogether builds the list of recommended rides in order to maximise the success rate of the offered matches. To test the performance of our scheme we use real data from Twitter and Foursquare sources in order to generate a dataset of plausible mobility patterns and ride requests in a metropolitan area. The results show that the proposed solution quickly obtain an accurate prediction of the personalised user's choice model both in static and dynamic conditions.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795857","","Automobiles;Heuristic algorithms;Feature extraction;Data models;Systems architecture;Urban areas","intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic control","machine-learned ranking algorithm;dynamic car pooling services;personalised car pooling services;GOTOGETHER;Twitter data;Foursquare sources;traffic congestion","","1","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this article is to review the existing automotive laser scanners and their capabilities to pave the way for developing new scanner prototypes, which are more capable in harsh weather conditions. Testing of scanner capabilities has been conducted in the northern part of the Finland, at Sodankylä Airport, where fog creates a special problem. The scanner has been installed in the airport area for data gathering and analyzes if fog, snow or rain are visible in the scanner data. The results indicate that these conditions degrade sensor performance by 25%, and therefore, future work in software module development should take this into account with in-vehicle system performance estimations concerning the visual range of the scanner.

Due to the high speed and limited frequency band, WLAN cannot satisfy the demands of city and intercity rail transit in the future. Time Division-Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE) technology allows to construct a flexible service environment compared with current WLAN based system. But with the development of the urban rail transit, the requirements of train-ground communication are increasing rapidly. So, if there are more than two trains running in the same RRU coverage area at the same time, the throughput capability is hard to satisfy the total requirements of the trains. In this paper, we first calculate the real throughput which includes no overhead. Then, a novel dual-association model based on TD-LTE is given. The novel model takes advantage of the fact that users can be associated with more than one RRU at the same time. The coverage diameter of single RRU, the overlap area of two neighbor RRUs and the headway distance are also considered in the novel model synthetically. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the novel dual-association which can decrease the stress of the serving RRU obviously.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795880","","Downlink;Throughput;Rails;Uplink;Resource management","Long Term Evolution;railway communication;resource allocation","dual-association resource allocation;train-ground communication system;time division-long term evolution;TD-LTE;urban rail transit systems;wireless local area network;WLAN;intercity rail transit;flexible service environment;RRU coverage area","","1","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work presents the formulation of the whole-body system dynamics from the load's perspective, in which the suspended load's dynamics appear explicitly in the equations of motion, while the aircraft's are handled implicitly. A nonlinear state-space representation of the system is obtained, with the load's position and orientation among the system states, allowing state-feedback strategies to directly control these variables. In real applications, available sensors provide information about the UAV's coordinates, thus the states of the present approach may not be directly measured. Then, this work also proposes a state estimation strategy, based on a set-membership, zonotopic technique, for which it is assumed that measurements are noisy and have different sampling times. Finally, a discrete-time, mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>∞</sub>controller with pole placement constraints, is designed for path tracking control of the suspended load with constant disturbances rejection, and feedback from the estimated states.

As each truck is assigned with different start and end locations, platoons will be frequently formed and split, while driving to their respective destinations. Additionally, the trucks are not the only ones driving on the road as there are other road users, which may influence how well a platoon can be formed. In this paper, an experimental study is conducted to investigate how traffic may affect a merging maneuver of two trucks trying to form a platoon on a public highway during rush hours. We obtained traffic data from Stockholm's motorway control system to determine the traffic condition for each test-run. Furthermore, we tried different truck speeds to study if it had any impacts on merge delay. Even in light traffic condition, a platoon merge could be delayed with over 10% compared to the ideal case with the absence of traffic.

However, the drawbacks of these algorithms make them insufficient for path planning when used separately in real-world traffic scenarios. Thus, it is crucial to build a unified framework that can combine the merits of different path planning algorithms. In this paper, a general and practical path planning framework for autonomous vehicles is proposed. At first, a sampling-based algorithm is designed to plan simple driving maneuvers such as following or changing traffic lane, or overtaking frontal obstacles. When complex maneuvers are required for free space navigation, which is beyond the scope of sampling-based algorithms, a grid-based algorithm is proposed to navigate the vehicle toward the target position along a collision-free trajectory. Off-line simulation results illustrate the generality and practicability of the proposed framework, which can effectively inherit the advantages from both sampling-based and grid-based path planning algorithms, and circumvent their individual shortages in the meantime.

In this framework each vehicle decides its own motion, rather than entrusting control of all vehicles to a central agent which then becomes a single point of failure. The motion plans are developed by reinforcement learning on simulations of intersection traffic. The developed system is shown to route vehicles to their destination in a safe and timely manner. In the near future, this system can be deployed to as a collision warning/collision avoidance aid to human drivers by selectively acting on the discrepancy between a human's behavior and the AI-determined safe behavior.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795737","","Automobiles;Roads;Navigation;Learning (artificial intelligence);Optimization","collision avoidance;intelligent transportation systems;navigation;road traffic;road vehicles","collision avoidance;AI-determined safe behavior;collision warning;route vehicles;intersection traffic;simulations;reinforcement learning;motion plans;central agent;distributed cooperative intelligence;autonomous traffic management;relaxed traffic rules;human drivers;autonomous vehicles;busy intersections;collision-free navigation;collective intelligence framework","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a basic prerequisite for the processes of their social life. Interaction is, among other definitions, described as the goal oriented, mutual behavior adaption process of individuals using verbal and non-verbal communication (i.e. speech, posture, gesture, and gaze) in their different social roles. One of these roles fulfil individuals when they participate in traffic. Traffic as a complex system does not always follow linear rules, as well as behavior adaption between road users that intend to claim the same infrastructural resource such as a road segment. Research in the field of transport engineering and traffic psychology apply sophisticated methods to reveal underlying processes and key factors in traffic that lead to dangerous situations or fatalities. Particularly in urban traffic as a classic example of complex systems, the processes as well as official and non-official regularities that contribute to a smooth, efficient and safe traffic flow are of special interest for traffic engineers and psychologists. Using driving simulators to investigate the behavior of traffic participants in selected situations is a common and broadly accepted method. Traffic in cities is, despite the legal regularities, strongly dependent upon the social interaction between drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. To analyze this behavior the common driving simulator approach lacks the vivid variety of human communication, verbal and non-verbal. Especially the latter plays a significant role in the discussed topic. To overcome this disadvantage of single simulator studies, a multi-participant simulator study was performed. A pedestrian simulator, based on motion tracking technology, and a driving simulator where linked so that the participants were able to communicate non-verbally. This approach enables the interaction between both in pedestrian crossing situations. Cross recurrence plots visualized this interaction and it was measured using cross recurrence quantification analysis. Results show remarkable differences in the quantification analysis metrics and interaction behavior could be classified within the cross recurrence plots. These findings have the potential to support the identification of crucial social interaction within the scope of environmental perception and situation understanding not only in pedestrian encounters but also within the research of automated vehicles.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795887","","Roads;Vehicles;Time series analysis;Bars;Length measurement;Time measurement;Urban areas","intelligent transportation systems;pedestrians;road traffic control","nonlinear quantification approach;traffic conflict research;social interaction;motion tracking technology;pedestrian simulator;cross recurrence quantification analysis;automated vehicles","","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, we concluded that the individual property is negatively correlated to its mobility property such as visited station, average travel distance and radius of gyration. Finally, we applied Markov chain (MC) based models to predict the actual accuracy of predictability and found that MC(1) model is adequate to produce a good result and extending the order of the model won't give substantial bonus, thus the first-order Markov property of expressway vehicles' trajectory is proved.

This problem derives from drivers' preferences to specific lane, which is contrary to common control strategy that usually takes the lane traffics as a whole. Lane-based timing technique can solve this problem, but the first step to apply it is to know external influential factors of the preferences, which should be taken as signal timing variables in optimization framework. This paper takes triple left-turn lanes at signalized intersection as study case. Compositional analysis of variance model and logit model is respectively applied to identify significant static and dynamic influential factors. An important finding is that some factors could have opposite effects on drivers' lane preferences in red and green phases, such as length of longitudinal vehicle movement at intersection and shadowed lane design, while others could impose the same influences on drivers in two phases, such as length of upstream segment, the total number of right-turn and through lanes in the approach. In addition, some factors could only be influential in red phase, which include length of lateral vehicle movement at intersection, location of first left-turn sign at upstream, length of left-turn queue, subject vehicle type and number of heavy vehicles. These factors should be taken into account when design pre-timed, accurate or adaptive lane-based signal timing plan.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795585","","Vehicles;Timing;Analytical models;Traffic control;Analysis of variance;Optimization","adaptive control;optimisation;road traffic control","driver left-turn lane preference;signalized intersection;traffic pattern;signal control efficiency;lane traffic;lane-based timing technique;signal timing variable;optimization;compositional analysis;variance model;logit model;static influential factor;dynamic influential factor;longitudinal vehicle movement;shadowed lane design;lateral vehicle movement;vehicle type;heavy vehicles;adaptive lane-based signal timing plan","","","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an integrated control strategy of TSP and speed guidance under the environment of Connected Vehicles. The strategy targets on buses running through an intersection with a dedicated bus lane installed and two adjacent bus stops located at the upstream and downstream. Aiming at improving bus punctuality and reducing negative impact (i.e. delay) on the general traffic of an intersection, this strategy controls transit operating speed and traffic signal by developing the following five models: a bus status judgment model, a bus dwelling model, a speed guidance model, a step-by-step signal priority control model, and a speed adjustment model. The bus dwelling model is developed for a bus arriving ahead of the schedule, and the speed guidance model is proposed for delayed buses. When the speed guidance model is ineffective, the signal priority control model will be considered. Two numerical examples are examined to test the performance of the proposed strategy. The results show that it can not only improve bus punctuality, but also reduce negative delay impact on other traffic flows entering an intersection.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795945","Transit Signal Priority;Speed Guidance;Schedule Adherence;Connected Vehicle Environment;Delay Degree","Vehicles;Delays;Schedules;Green products;Real-time systems;Numerical models","delays;public transport;road traffic control;scheduling;velocity control","schedule-based strategy;transit signal priority;connected vehicle environment;transit system punctuality;transit system efficiency;vehicle movement information;TSP operation;integrated control strategy;dedicated bus lane;adjacent bus stops;bus punctuality;transit operating speed control;traffic signal;bus status judgment model;bus dwelling model;speed guidance model;step-by-step signal priority control model;speed adjustment model;bus arrival;bus delay;traffic flow","","1","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Resilience can improve the ability of the system to resist the adverse interference very well. Therefore, it is significant to study the quantitative analysis and improvement strategies of the system resilience. The resilience is defined as the capability of a system returning to normal state when suffered interference which may lead to the decrease of the system function. In this paper, discrete time Bayesian network approach is used to analyze the reliability of the on-board equipment with higher frequency of failure occurrence, and the resilience evaluation model is constructed. It is necessary to evaluate the resilience of the on-board equipment when the failure occurs in the process of operation. In addition, the failure of the on-board equipment in the operation process is divided into short-term recoverable failure and short-term unrecoverable failure. When the short-term recoverable failure occurs in the on-board equipment, such as the main equipment of the redundant equipment, the resilience of the system is 98.89%.

We conducted a simulator study on 26 drivers to compare three conditions: manual mode (MD), transition from automated driving (AD) to MD with a classical head up display (HUD), transition from (AD) to MD with an augmented reality (AR) HUD. In our scenarios, the driver has to take over to respect the navigation request for a lane change, and has to face slowing traffic in the destination lane. Compared to MD, driving behavior is altered in the transition phase up to 30s: the maximum speed on the brake pedal is higher, resulting acceleration being thus increased. AR reduces both these effects, thus improving driving comfort while facing slow traffic. AR also helps better anticipate the lane change maneuver: it increases the distance to the maneuver limit point. As such, the situational awareness seems to be improved by AR. Further analysis of eye tracking data and verbatim is needed to confirm this assumption based on driving data.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795767","","Automobiles;Navigation;Roads;Testing;Sensors","augmented reality;head-up displays;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic control","classical head up display;manual mode;automated driving;augmented reality;eye tracking data","","4","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is a classifier system which enables us to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate per-frame angle estimations. To achieve a final calibration only the accurate (classified as positive) per-frame estimations are incorporated in a temporal filter. In our research we found that a fixed amount of positive classified per-frame estimations (a fixed temporal filter length) can be specified which guarantees an exact final calibration. With that, our system is able to autonomously signalizes the moment at which an accurate calibration is achieved while driving.

Classical approaches based on continuous optimization formulate the trajectory generation problem as a nonlinear program, in which vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance requirements are enforced as nonlinear equality and inequality constraints. In general, gradient-based optimization methods are then used to find the optimal trajectory. However, these methods are ill-suited for logical constraints such as those raised by traffic rules, presence of obstacles and, more generally, to the existence of multiple maneuver variants. We propose a new formulation of the trajectory planning problem as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program. This formulation can be solved efficiently using widely available solvers, and the resulting trajectory is guaranteed to be globally optimal.

As we will show, the different characteristics of these induced optical flows lead to a reprojection error that depends on the coordinates of the features. When using a proper normalization of the reprojection error, this coordinate-dependency can be almost completely removed for decoupled motions. Furthermore, we present a way to use these results for automotive application where rotation and forward motion are coupled. This is done by compensating for the flow that is induced by the rotation, which decouples the translation flow from the overall flow. The resulting method generalizes the ROCC approach [4], where a robust outlier criterion was introduced and proved to increase robustness and quality for large forward translation motions.

Instead of selecting a single frame to perform the recognition, we propose a novel real-time approach to automatically detect the vehicle and identify (locate/recognize) its license plate based on temporal redundancy information. To achieve further improvements, we also propose two post-processing techniques by querying a license plate database. The experimental results, performed in a dataset composed of 300 on-track vehicles acquired on an urban road, demonstrate that it is possible to improve the vehicle recognition rate in 15:3 percentage points using our proposal temporal redundancy approach. Additional 7:8 percentage points are achieved by querying registered license plates on a database by the vehicle appearance, leading to a final recognition rate of 89:6%.

Many traffic signal strategies have been presented to increase the throughput of an urban network and reduce the total delay. The difficulty is that a successful local optimization does not mean a better global performance and that the high complexity makes centralized coordinated strategies usually not efficient for a large network. To overcome these drawbacks, some promising distributed strategies are presented, such as the back-pressure algorithm. Whereas the back-pressure algorithm overcomes the main fundamental problems, some practical issues are not considered. Firstly, the original back-pressure algorithm does not take the all red time into consideration. Secondly, the algorithm relies strongly on the loop detector, which decreases the robustness. Therefore, this paper shows a dynamic green time approach which overcomes these drawbacks of the back-pressure algorithm. In the approach, the green time length depends on two elements: the back-pressure at the intersection and the upstream queue length. Meanwhile the green time for each phase is restricted to durations between 15 seconds and 65 seconds to ensure the robustness. The method is tested in a simulation. This shows that optimal dynamic green time approach shows the best performance among other green time mechanisms, such as fixed green time approach. The green time approach not only makes the back-pressure more practical, but also keeps the good network performance of the original algorithm.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795593","","Heuristic algorithms;Junctions;Vehicle dynamics;Optimization;Robustness;Green products;Throughput","distributed control;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic control","optimal dynamic green time;distributed signal control;urban network;back-pressure algorithm;fixed green time approach;traffic signal strategies","","1","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, before a particular control algorithm can be deployed, it needs to be thoroughly analysed to see if it can indeed produce the desired effect under all sorts of traffic conditions and with varying penetration rates of V2X technology. In addition, one would also need to collect data on data packet delivery rate and the amount of delay, using different platoon management protocols. This information can then be utilized as a feedback to fine tune both the protocol and the control algorithm itself. This work aims to provide a holistic platform which integrates three simulators VISSIM (Traffic Simulation), NS-3 (Network Simulation) and MATLAB (Platoon control algorithm) that allows testing control algorithm stability in the presence of realistic communication constraints. To illustrate the usability of this co-simulation framework, we have presented results on velocity tracking of leader by follower vehicles while maintaining a specified inter-vehicular gap, for a small platoon along with results on data packet delivery for larger platoons.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795680","","Vehicles;Mathematical model;Protocols;MATLAB;Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Testing","intelligent transportation systems;mathematics computing;road traffic control","integrated V2X simulator;vehicle platooning;traffic simulation;network simulation;VISSIM simulator;NS-3 simulator;MATLAB;platoon control algorithm;velocity tracking","","2","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many of the different approaches which have been proposed to tackle this challenge are based on optimal control and employ local continuous or discrete optimization schemes. While discrete methods possess the ability to find reasonable solutions in a search space incorporating local minima, they tend to sacrifice optimality for real-time performance. On the other hand, local continuous methods require suitable initialization to handle the combinatorial nature of on-road driving scenarios but are capable of quickly returning an optimized solution. The presented work proposes a hybrid solution which embraces both strategies to unite their distinct advantages.

In this work, we focus on station-based car sharing and we define an optimization problem for the deployment of its stations. The goal of this problem is to find the minimum cost deployment (in terms of number of stations and their capacity) that can guarantee a pre-defined level of service to the customers (in terms of probability of finding an available car/parking space). This problem combines insights from queueing theory (used to model the stochastic demand for cars/parking spaces at the stations) with a variant of the classical set covering problem. For its evaluation, we use a trace of more than 100,000 pickup and drop-off events at a free-floating car sharing service in The Netherlands, which are used to model the input demand of the car sharing system.

Object tracking is one of the challenging problems of autonomous driving in 3D dynamic environments. Although different approaches are proposed for object tracking with demonstrated success in driving environments, it is very difficult to evaluate and compare them because they are defined with various constraints and boundary conditions.

In order to test this hypothesis, we use real data of thousands of vehicles recorded in the United States as part of the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) program. To study the hypothesis, we pretend each human-driven vehicle is automated: These automated vehicles drive exactly as the recorded human drivers, but they have a much smaller reaction time and thus can still drive safely in situations that are unsafe for human drivers. The main result is that in only very few cases an automated vehicle would not drive safely, although more than half of the human drivers do not keep a safe distance according to their capabilities. Thus, there is no increased risk of vehicles cutting in-and if they do, automated vehicles are only at risk in around 10% of all cases compared to around 60% for human drivers.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795599","","Vehicles;Acceleration;Data models;Safety;Roads;Vehicle crash testing","automatic guided vehicles;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic control","Next Generation Simulation program;human-driven vehicle;automated vehicles;traffic flow","","5","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, in the United States in recent years, about 700 cyclists were killed and about 48,000 were injured in bicycle motor vehicle crashes each year. Regarding crash location, from 2008 to 2012 in the United States, more than 30% of cyclist fatalities occurred at intersections. Furthermore, up to 16% of bicycle-related crashes were due to cyclist violations at intersections. Second, from 2000 to 2011, bicycle commuting rates in the United States has increased: by 80% in large Bicycle Friendly Cities (BFCs), by 32% in non-BFCs, and overall by 47%. Also, cycling as one of the sustainable and eco-friendly modes of transport is receiving more attention than before. In this paper, to investigate factors affecting cyclist behavior at signalized intersections, a naturalistic cycling experiment was designed and conducted. Applying mixed effects generalized regression analysis, movement and presence of other users were found as significant factors that influence the probability of red light violations by cyclists. Moreover, several machine learning algorithms were adopted to develop cyclist violation prediction models at signalized intersections.

Many researchers are now focussing on making vehicles safer and more efficient by improving vehicles' interaction with their environment and assisting drivers to make better decisions with less errors. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems are a way to connect vehicles to the most important part of their environment which is the surrounding traffic. It has been shown that using the data from preceding traffic by ACC systems can significantly improve the driving performance. This study presents an ecological ACC (Eco-ACC) system that takes advantage of a radar and traffic light-to-vehicle communications (TL2VC) to predict the future trajectory of its preceding vehicle and employs this information to drive the vehicle with an ecological driving pattern. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and the model predictive control (MPC) method is used to solve it.

The localization system converts the dense 3D point clouds of a 3D LiDAR into sparse local maps, which allowed the reduction of the localization processing time without deteriorating its accuracy. We propose two map-matching distance functions: one is an improvement on the traditional Likelihood Field distance between two grid-maps and the other is an adaptation of the standard Cosine distance between two high-dimensional vectors, commonly used in the Information Retrieval research area. To collect data for evaluating the localization system, we used an in-house autonomous car.

In such a highly dynamic and engaging situation, drivers are prone to make a mistake. In this paper, we look into the intersection behavior of the driver to predict an unexpected maneuver that would cause deviation from the planned path such as missing an upcoming turn or make a last minute aggressive maneuver. We conduct an on-road test of naturally following planned route as suggested by the navigation system. Our ultimate goal is to develop a Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that can predict unexpected maneuver and help driver in timely manner to correct those mistakes e.g. by providing detail navigation instructions for the driver to better orient himself or herself in a challenging situation.

In the most likely scenario, hybrid vehicular networks will use the IEEE 802.11p protocol for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, and the cellular network (e.g. LTE or 5G) as a gateway to remote servers. Both technologies have their own flaws as IEEE 802.11p available bandwidth drops quickly with the accretion of vehicles in the vicinity, and intensive cellular usage can be costly. In this context we intend to minimize this cost while ensuring system reliability. Clustering vehicles can significantly reduce cellular network usage when the Cluster Head (CH) is the only node that communicates with the cellular Base Station (BS) and also performs data aggregation. Other nodes communicate with the CH using multi-hop forwarding over IEEE 802.11p. There is however a tradeoff in cluster design. On the positive side, large clusters lead to high aggregation levels and thus low usage of the uplink cellular resources. On the negative side, large clusters also increase packet losses in the IEEE 802.11p network affecting communication reliability. In this paper, we study the impact of the number of communication hops on the average size of formed clusters, on data compression, and on IEEE 802.11p packet losses in various vehicle densities. We present a new clustering algorithm which delegates the CH election to the cellular BS, significantly improving the cluster formation compared to CH self-election algorithms. We propose a dynamic clustering approach that adapts the cluster size to the vehicle density and optimize data compression under the constraint of an acceptable IEEE 802.11p packet loss.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795609","","Vehicles;Clustering algorithms;Cellular networks;Packet loss;Heuristic algorithms;Long Term Evolution","cellular radio;data compression;optimisation;pattern clustering;telecommunication network reliability;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless LAN","dynamic cluster size optimization;hybrid cellular-vehicular network;ground-breaking innovation;IEEE 802.11p protocol;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;V2V communication;remote server;cost minimization;system reliability;clustering vehicle;cellular network usage reduction;cluster head;cellular base station;BS;data aggregation;multihop forwarding;uplink cellular resources;IEEE 802.11p packet loss;CH election;dynamic clustering approach;vehicle density;data compression","","2","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The growing number of taxi trips is cause for concern when vacant taxis are not distributed optimally within the city and are unable to find waiting passengers effectively. A way of improving taxi operations is to deploy a taxi dispatch system that considers the interrelated effects of taxis on other traffic modes. This paper presents a taxi dispatch model that takes into account the impact of taxis on normal traffic flows while optimizing for an effective dispatch policy. The presented model builds on the concept of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to represent the dynamic evolution of the traffic conditions. A model predictive control approach is devised to control the taxi dispatch system on a two-region city case study. The results show that the case of no network-scale taxi dispatching leads to severe accumulation of taxi passengers and vacant taxis in different regions whereas the dispatch system improves the taxi service performance and reduces traffic congestion by regulating the network towards the undersaturated condition.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795592","","Public transportation;Vehicles;Dispatching;Urban areas;Mathematical model;Vehicle dynamics;Predictive control","dispatching;predictive control;public transport;road traffic control","large-scale taxi dispatching system;urban networks;dispatch policy;traffic congestion reduction;taxi service performance improvement;model predictive control;dynamic evolution;MFD;macroscopic fundamental diagram","","3","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A gradient-based approach computes the derivatives to find the optimal value. Therefore, the optimization problem should involve only smooth functions. Hence, for nonsmooth functions that may appear in the internal model of the MPC controller, we propose smoothening approaches. The controller then uses an integrated smooth flow and emission model, where the control objective is to reduce a weighted combination of the total time spent and total emissions of the vehicles.

The system is implemented and evaluated in the INTEGRATION microscopic traffic assignment and simulation software. The proposed algorithm is compared to an optimum fixed-time plan and an actuated control algorithm to evaluate the performance of the proposed Nash bargaining approach for different traffic demand levels. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Nash bargaining control algorithm outperforms the fixed-time and actuated control algorithms for the various traffic conditions. The benefits are observed in improvements in the stopped delay, queue length, travel time, average vehicle speed, system throughput, fuel consumption, and emission levels. Specifically, the simulation results show a reduction in the average travel time ranging from 37% to 65%, a reduction in the total delay ranging from 41% to 64%, a reduction in the queue length ranging from 58% to 77% and a reduction in the emission levels ranging from 6% to 17%.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795755","Traffic signal control;game theory;Nash bargaining;INTEGRATION software","Vehicles;Niobium;Games;Delays;Optimization;Adaptation models;Software","control engineering computing;game theory;road traffic control;traffic engineering computing","isolated traffic signal control algorithm;game-theoretic optimization framework;signalized intersection;variable phasing sequence;free cycle length;Nash bargaining solution;INTEGRATION microscopic traffic assignment and simulation software","","2","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A questionnaire study was conducted in three European regions, Catalonia (Spain), Berlin (Germany) and Trikala (Greece), among 95 travelers who were asked to use a specific multimodal trip planner in their everyday life. The travelers' attitudes towards the planner were positive and they expected it to be beneficial, offering them more possibilities to find the optimum route, enhancing their comfort and reducing their stress while travelling. Some decrease in the frequency of use of private car and increase in the frequency of use of public transport and walking before and while using the planner were found in two of the regions. Users did not expect a change in the number of journeys done by private car or public transport due to the usage of the planner. Although the findings have to be further verified, the present study indicates that the availability of information about environmentally-friendly transport modes via a multimodal trip planner, is rather not enough to achieve a shift of travelers to such modes.

The idea of the new approach is that each cell of the tracking area is associated with a so called layer, by using a new introduced layer distribution. The automatic adaption of the layer values occurs by the weights of the particles which are located in the cells of the tracking area. Depending on the layers, which are associated with the single particle positions, the particles get different areal extents. So, the posterior density is approximated using particles which have different areal extents. The principle of multiple layers is also used for finding new appearing objects via a reinitialization step. On basis of such a multi-layer particle filter, the tracking quality and robustness can be increased compared to the conventional method, especially when the measurement quality is low.

Upsampling is often based on combining data from a monocular camera to compensate the low-resolution of a LIDAR. This paper, on the other hand, introduces a novel framework to obtain dense depth-map solely from a single LIDAR point cloud; which is a research direction that has been barely explored. The formulation behind the proposed depth-mapping process relies on local spatial interpolation, using sliding-window (mask) technique, and on the Bilateral Filter (BF) where the variable of interest, the distance from the sensor, is considered in the interpolation problem. In particular, the BF is conveniently modified to perform depth-map upsampling such that the edges (foreground-background discontinuities) are better preserved by means of a proposed method which influences the range-based weighting term. Other methods for spatial upsampling are discussed, evaluated and compared in terms of different error measures. This paper also researches the role of the mask's size in the performance of the implemented methods. Quantitative and qualitative results from experiments on the KITTI Database, using LIDAR point clouds only, show very satisfactory performance of the approach introduced in this work.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795953","","Laser radar;Interpolation;Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Vehicles;Spatial resolution;Estimation","","","","9","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed approach takes a prebuilt global grid map as prior knowledge for localization. Model based feature extraction method is introduced to provide laser points classification, with each extracted point allocated a specified weight to describe local characteristic. The prior grid map is generated from weighted point cloud to be able to describe the local metric features such as curbs and building facades. Localization function is then carried out with a weight point based maximum likelihood matching method to determine the correspondence between local point cloud and the reference grid map. There are also position initialization and reference map management modules to make the framework more practical and reliable.

In this paper, we examine the factors affecting the efficiency of online map matching algorithms that are based on probabilistic sequence models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and present several heuristic optimizations to improve their speed and latency. As shortest path computations account for most of the running time of probabilistic map matching algorithms, we propose a method for reducing the total number of such computations by pruning unlikely states in the probabilistic sequence model. Furthermore, we speed up the one-to-many shortest path computations by limiting the search space to an elliptical area that encompasses all the targeted destinations. We present a technique for reducing the latency of the Viterbi algorithm used to find the most likely state sequence in a HMM or a similar model. This technique enables the early output of partial state sequences based on an estimate of the probability of a state being part of the eventual most likely sequence. Experiments using real-world location data show that the heuristic optimizations significantly reduce the running time and output latency with negligible loss of accuracy.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795968","","Hidden Markov models;Roads;Viterbi algorithm;Optimization;Computational modeling;Vehicles;Probabilistic logic","hidden Markov models;maximum likelihood estimation;probability;sequences;transportation","heuristic optimization;high-speed low-latency online map matching;location data processing;smartphone;real-time transportation application;hidden Markov model;HMM;shortest path computation;probabilistic sequence model;Viterbi algorithm","","1","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It must however, be noted that naturalistic driving scenes suffer from rapidly changing illumination and occlusion. This is aggravated by the fact that hands are highly deformable objects, and change in appearance frequently. This work addresses the task of accurately localizing driver hands and classifying the grasp state of each hand. We use a fast ConvNet to first detect likely hand regions. Next, a pixel-based skin classifier that takes into account the global illumination changes is used to refine the hand detections and remove false positives. This step generates a pixel-level mask for each hand. Finally, we study each such masked regions and detect if the driver is grasping the wheel, or in some cases a mobile phone. Through evaluation we demonstrate that our method can outperform state-of-the-art pixel based hand detectors, while running faster (at 35 fps) than other deep ConvNet based frameworks even for grasp analysis. Hand mask cues are shown to be crucial when analyzing a set of driver hand gestures (wheel/mobile phone grasp and no-grasp) in naturalistic driving settings. The proposed detection and localization pipeline hence can act as a general framework for real-time hand detection and gesture classification.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795965","In-cabin activity analysis;hand-object interaction;driver cell-phone usage;human-vehicle interaction;highly automated vehicles;control transition;takeover readiness","Feature extraction;Skin;Lighting;Vehicles;Detectors;Image color analysis;Wheels","image classification;image sensors;palmprint recognition","driver hand localization;grasp analysis;vision-based real-time approach;in-vehicular infotainment application;occupant safety;fast ConvNet framework;pixel-based skin classifier;global illumination;pixel-level mask;pixel based hand region detection;naturalistic driving setting;pipeline;gesture classification;mobile phone","","","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, results from multiple simulations are compared with real life data. These comparisons show that during traffic congestions, driving efficiency of amateur drivers on a highway declines with an increase in the vehicular density on the same highway.

Then, to design the constrained linear MPC, the equations of motion of the Tilt-rotor UAV with suspended load are linearized around the reference trajectory. Furthermore, to achieve null steady state error throughout the trajectory in presence of constant external disturbances and parametric uncertainties, the state vector is augmented with the integral action of some selected states. In addition, since the system is underactuated, the prediction model is also formulated in the incremental form to cope with disturbances affecting the system.

Essentially, this means that the desired network behaviour is achieved and, at the same time, there is no vehicle in the network that obtains clear knowledge of the state of any other vehicle. This results in a privacy-preserving feature which is particularly useful in smart cities applications, where drivers might not be willing to share their transient state with others.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795959","","Vehicles;Base stations;Roads;Algorithm design and analysis;Acceleration;White noise;Convergence","data privacy;smart cities;traffic information systems","state obfuscation;speed advisory systems;SAS;obfuscated information;network behaviour;privacy-preserving feature;smart cities applications;transient state","","6","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A platoon forms a chain of vehicles (e.g., trucks) for improved traffic and fuel efficiency. Platooning algorithms aim to maintain small inter-vehicular distance between vehicles under dynamic driving conditions like acceleration and deceleration. The random delay and dropped messages have a pronounced impact on the control algorithm especially in a congested communication network. In this work, a decentralized platooning control strategy is proposed such that each vehicle can independently switch between multiple controller strategies dependent on communication topologies or the pattern of information exchange from vehicles in-front. The control strategy takes into account V2V communication delay of up to 100ms. In order to overcome the impact of dropped messages a predictive control scheme is proposed. We show the existence of well-known Common Quadratic Lyapunov Function (CQLF), to prove the stability of this switched system.

One of the most important problems is traffic congestion. Currently, most traffic systems still use fixed-time setting for a very long cycle. These systems cannot dynamically adjust traffic light timing in response to unexpected situations such as traffic accidents, natural calamities, or sudden incidents. With advances in technology, traffic data such as traffic volume, speed, and waiting time can now be gathered by sensors or cameras. Leveraging on automatic traffic data collection we try to address the traffic congestion issue by proposing a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Traffic Light Control System (MTLCS). MTLCS includes a traffic flow prediction model and a traffic timing optimization method. Historical traffic data is used to predict future traffic volumes. An MPC-based traffic light optimization method is proposed to obtain appropriate time settings that can reduce overall congestion. Our method also has the ability to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings. It can rapidly respond to real-time traffic conditions to reduce traffic congestion. Experiments show that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of our traffic flow prediction model is less than 12%. Using the proposed MPC-based optimization method, the average waiting rate is reduced by 29.70%, when compared with the fixed-time traffic light control system.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795937","","Predictive models;Vehicles;Control systems;Genetic algorithms;Optimization methods;Timing","optimisation;prediction theory;predictive control;road traffic control","fixed-time traffic light control system;MPC-based optimization method;MAPE;mean absolute percentage error;traffic timing optimization method;traffic flow prediction model;MTLCS;automatic traffic data collection;sensor;camera;traffic accident;traffic light timing adjustment;model-predictive control method;dynamic traffic light optimization","","1","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to consider applications of RL in commercial UTC products, they need to enable fine-grained optimization of multiple traffic objectives and be validated in realistic UTC simulations. This paper presents REALT, a UTC system based on Distributed W-Learning (DWL), a multi-policy multi-agent RL-based optimization technique, which enables it to address multiple traffic optimization goals simultaneously. We introduce an extension of DWL with fine-grained traffic observation to enable adaptation of phase duration rather than just phase selection. We also evaluate the impact of action set selection in RL applications to UTC, by introducing a phase generation module which enables REALT to use different phase sets.

Most of these accidents occur when the driver becomes distracted and a loss-of-control situation occurs. Steer-by-Wire systems were recently proposed as an alternative to mitigate such accidents. This technology enables the decoupling of the front wheel steering angles from the driver hand wheel angle and, consequently, the measurement of road/tire friction limits and the development of novel control systems capable of ensuring vehicle stabilization and safety. However, vehicle safety boundaries are highly dependent on tire characteristics which vary significantly with temperature, wear and the tire manufacturing process. Therefore, design of autonomous vehicle and driver assistance controllers cannot assume that these characteristics are constant or known. Thus, this paper proposes a Guaranteed Cost Model Predictive Controller Driver Assistance System able to avoid front and rear tire saturation and to track the drivers intent up to the limits of handling for a vehicle with uncertain tire parameters.

Because of the amount of different traffic situations and influence factors on the task of driving, due to uncertainties in environmental sensor measurements, and as a consequence of variable and individual driving styles, probabilistic models in combination with machine learning techniques are often applied to learn driving behavior from data. In this paper, with the help of a simulator study, the driving behavior of a subject group is examined regarding their intention to change lane on highways. The simulator is set up as a partially automated driving system that takes discrete maneuver wishes as input (lane change left or lane change right). If the traffic situation permits it, the requested maneuvers is executed automatically by the system. This generates ground truth labels that are being used to train a lane change intention classifier. The results show that the approach is able to predict upcoming lane changes at an average of more than 3.5 seconds in advance.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795661","","Vehicles;Roads;Bayes methods;Logistics;Support vector machines;Decision making;Probabilistic logic","cooperative systems;driver information systems;estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","lane change intentions;lane contentedness estimation;demonstrated driving;cooperative driving;driving behavior anticipation;environmental sensor measurements uncertainties;driving styles;probabilistic models;machine learning techniques;learn driving behavior;automated driving system;discrete maneuver wishes;lane change intention classifier","","3","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the used cameras are installed statically, change detection is often employed as the first operation and all subsequent processing steps rely on its quality.

In this study, relevant government documents from 1995 to 2012 were reviewed and quantified. On this basis, seven scenarios were set and analyzed by the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System to evaluate their emission mitigation potential. The results show that FE&amp;ES is the most effective way to limit CO2 emission growth by reducing 7.4 MtCO2e in 2030, and the NEA in reducing emissions of other air pollutants, such as NOx, CO and PM10. Furthermore, the comparison between Reference Scenario(RS) and Combined Mitigation Scenario(CMS) indicates that emissions from urban road transport in Shanghai will peak before 2030 if all of the measures are carried out strictly, and per capita urban road transport CO2 emission can be stabilized around 0.57 tCO2e from 2020, still below the global average.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795859","","Roads;Standards;Petroleum;Automobiles","air pollution control;transportation","urban road transport emission mitigation;LEAP;Shanghai government;vehicle control;transit priority;fuel economy and emission standard;efficient management;new energy automobile;VC;TP;FE&ES;EM;NEA;long-range energy alternatives planning system;air pollutant emission;reference scenario;combined mitigation scenario;RS;CMS","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For optimal performance, head pose estimation needs to be non-invasive, calibration-free and accurate for varying driving and illumination conditions. In this pilot study we investigate a 3D head pose estimation system that automatically fits a statistical 3D face model to measurements of a driver's face, acquired with a low-cost depth sensor on challenging real-world data. We evaluate the results of our sensor-independent, driver-adaptive approach to those of a state-of-the-art camera-based 2D face tracking system as well as a non-adaptive 3D model relative to own ground-truth data, and compare to other 3D benchmarks. We find large accuracy benefits of the adaptive 3D approach.

In terms of accuracy, 95% of all our results have a position error of less than 9.50 mm, and a rotation error of less than 4.41°.

Accurate and reliable relative localization is obtained from a LiDAR odometry. Consistency checks based on the cumulative sum (CUSUM) test are instrumented for rejection of inconsistent map matching results from the fusion procedure.

The solution of the resulting optimization problem provides the best way of satisfying the overall demand by maximizing the overall profit. The way in which the overall profit is, then, allocated to the different carriers, thus determining carrier individual profits, is analyzed by using five game theory (GT) allocation methods.

The aim of this paper is to present an approach that is suitable for such a task in both online and offline applications as a post-processing step after the actual detection and classification step. This is achieved by adapting a perception-based line-clustering algorithm that groups the pre-classified road features based on their relations and assigns them a final class.

The ODO will be taken as an example to verify the validity of the proposed method. There are three statuses of wheels in the train running process. To implement the detecting procedure of fault state for train's wheels, firstly extracting the feature from Odometer data during the running course of train. The feature will be preprocessed with algorithm of amplitude normalized and scalar quantization, then establishing the hidden fault states of ODO model by training data. Finally the ODO fault condition classifier is set up. By inputting the observation sequence which matches with improved HMM models classifier, the status of ODO is obtained effectively. Experimental results show that the diagnosis model built with proposed method can provide high diagnosis performance for different fault types. The diagnostic accuracy is up to 100% between normal and fault conditions and the overall diagnostic accuracy is up to 96.67%.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795989","","Hidden Markov models;Wheels;Training;Genetic algorithms;Circuit faults;Global Positioning System;Fault diagnosis","distance measurement;fault diagnosis;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;Global Positioning System;hidden Markov models;pattern classification;position control;rail traffic control;railway safety","ODO fault condition classifier;scalar quantization;amplitude normalized quantization;odometer data;feature extraction;train wheels;fault state detection procedure;training speed;GA;genetic algorithm;hidden Markov model;fault diagnosis method;GPS;train positioning methods;safe train operation;train control system;train location unit;HMM model classifier","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Online friction estimation poses large challenges in terms of availability and accuracy of the estimate. When estimating the friction based on the slip and force of a tyre, the accuracy of the estimate depends on the current tyre friction utilisation. This paper presents a method to evaluate how large friction utilisation is required to estimate the current friction level within a given error using an effect-based approach. The results indicate that large variations in the required utilisation should be expected for different tyre and road surface combinations when tyre models that only have the slip stiffness and the friction coefficient as parameters (e.g. brush tyre model) are used in the observer to estimate the friction coefficient. For the brush tyre model it varied from 54% in the best case to 94% in the worst case. To illustrate the benefit of quantification of required utilisation, an example use of an estimator based on the brush tyre model is shown at the end of this paper. A simulation is performed to show how fast a sudden drop in friction during braking can be detected using a recursive online estimator. The results show that the estimator is able to detect the change in friction and converge to the new friction level in 0.06 s, which is fast enough to potentially improve the performance of ABS systems of trucks. Tyre models for online friction estimation must hence be chosen with the intended use in mind. The results show that the friction information estimated using the brush tyre model at larger excitation levels is reliable and can therefore be shared with other road users in order to improve the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795966","","Tires;Friction;Vehicles;Force;Roads;Estimation;Brushes","friction;road vehicles;tyres","excitation quantification;friction estimation;tyre-road friction coefficient;intervention thresholds;vehicle velocity;tyre slip;tyre force;friction utilisation;recursive online estimator;brush tyre model;transportation system","","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is difficult, however, to achieve lane-level accuracy with low-cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers due to the biased noisy pseudo-range measurements. Approaches such as Differential GNSS can improve the accuracy, but usually require an enormous amount of investment in base stations. The emerging connected vehicle technologies provide an alternative approach to improving the localization accuracy. It has been shown in this paper that localization accuracy can be enhanced by fusing GNSS information within a group of connected vehicles and matching the configuration of the group to a digital map to eliminate the common bias in localization. A Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) was used to jointly estimate the common biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicles positions. Multipath biases, which are non-common to vehicles, were mitigated by a multi-hypothesis detection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation was exploited through the prediction-update process. The proposed approach was compared to the existing static and smoothed static methods in the intersection scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduced the estimation error by fifty percent and reduced the estimation variance by two orders of magnitude.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795652","Cooperative vehicle localization;GNSS;Map matching;Multipath biases;Rao-Blackwellization;Particle filter","Vehicles;Receivers;Roads;Estimation;Position measurement;Noise measurement;Atmospheric measurements","estimation theory;particle filtering (numerical methods);radio direction-finding;radio receivers;satellite navigation;vehicular ad hoc networks","connected vehicle network;Rao-Blackwellized particle filter;lane-level accuracy;Global Navigation Satellite System receiver;biased noisy pseudorange measurement;differential GNSS localization;base station;RBPF;multihypothesis detection-rejection approach;temporal correlation;prediction-update process;smoothed static method;estimation variance reduction","","1","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are several reasons carpooling is still not the preferred mode of commute in the United States: first, complex human factors, including time constraints and not having right incentive structures, discourage the sharing of rides; second, algorithmic and technical barriers inhibit the development of online services for matching riders. In this work, we study algorithms for 3+ high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, which permit vehicles that hold three or more people. We focus on the technical barriers but also address the aforementioned human factors. We formulate the HOV3 Carpool problem, and show that it is NP-Complete. We thus pose the relaxed problem HOV3- Carpool problem, allowing groups of up to size three, and propose several methods for solving the problem of finding globally optimal carpool groups that may utilize these 3- HOV lanes. Our methods include local search, integer programming, and dynamic programming. Our local search methods include sampling-based (hill-climbing and simulated annealing), classical neighborhood search, and a hybrid random neighborhood search. We assess the methods numerically in terms of objective value and scalability. Our findings show that our sampling-based local search methods scale up to 100K agents, thereby improving upon related previous work (which studies up to 1000 agents). The hill climbing local search method converges significantly closer and faster towards a naive lower bound on cumulative carpooling cost.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795739","","Vehicles;Search problems;Optimization;Silicon;Dynamic programming;Complexity theory","computational complexity;integer programming;random processes;sampling methods;search problems;simulated annealing;transportation","hybrid random neighborhood search;classical neighborhood search;simulated annealing;hill-climbing local search;sampling-based local search;dynamic programming;integer programming;3- HOV lanes;HOV3- Carpool problem;NP-complete problem;high-occupancy vehicle lanes;ride sharing;United States;tractable carpool problem;diamond lane optimization","","1","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both algorithms are designed individually as cooperative fusion processes where other sensors (GPS and proprioceptive information) and dedicated maps are integrated to strengthen the advantages of each system.

The inflow limitation is imposed at selected main entry links (gated links) and results in queuing of vehicles at the boundaries of the network. Most of the works on this subject neglected the effect of the queued vehicles on the traffic conditions upstream of the gated links. In this paper we analyze in microsimulation the queuing at the gated links and its effect on network performance for a realistic network model. Moreover, a queue management strategy based on a continuous quadratic knapsack problem aiming at balancing relative queues at the gated links is proposed. Simulation results suggest that queues under perimeter control are shorter in space and time than with no perimeter control. Additionally, managing the queues at the gated links not only improves the overall network performance but also reduces the possibility of queue propagation to the upstream junctions.

While some sensors, such as camera devices, perceive the environment as a snapshot, other sensors are based on a scanning technique. The iterative acquisition principle of scanning sensors lead to considerable time differences between single measurements within a scan. In addition to transfer and processing delays, these time differences have to be considered properly for a comprehensive environment representation. This paper focuses on time-related effects resulting from using a scanning sensor. The influence on two commonly utilized environment representations is discussed, grid-based and object-based approaches for stationary and movable elements, respectively.

The visual attention of a driver is an important aspect to consider, as most driving tasks require visual resources. Previous work has investigated algorithms to detect driver visual attention by tracking the head or eye movement. While tracking pupil can give an accurate direction of visual attention, estimating gaze on vehicle environment is a challenging problem due to changes in illumination, head rotations, and occlusions (e.g. hand, glasses). Instead, this paper investigates the use of the head pose as a coarse estimate of the driver visual attention. The key challenge is the non-trivial relation between head and eye movements while glancing to a target object, which depends on the driver, the underlying cognitive and visual demand, and the environment. First, we evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art head pose detection algorithm over natural driving recordings, which are compared with ground truth estimations derived from AprilTags attached to a headband. Then, the study proposes regression models to estimate the drivers' gaze based on the head position and orientation, which are built with data from natural driving recordings. The proposed system achieves high accuracy over the horizontal direction, but moderate/low performance over the vertical direction. We compare results while our participants were driving, and when the vehicle was parked.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795905","","Visualization;Cameras;Magnetic heads;Head;Roads;Automobiles","driver information systems;gaze tracking;image motion analysis;object detection;pose estimation;regression analysis","driver visual attention;driver behavior monitoring;advanced driver assistance systems;ADAS;driver actions detection;driving tasks;visual resources;head movements;eye movements;cognitive demand;visual demand;head pose detection;regression models;driver gaze estimation;head position;head orientation;natural driving recordings","","6","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This provides new opportunities to design and test systems to control the acceleration dynamics of those equipped vehicles in mixed traffic environment contexts, with the global aim to globally reduce traffic congestion and increase traffic safety. Recent work has been focusing on proposing solutions to this problem by applying modern control theory, such as optimal control, ℋ<sub>∞</sub>control. However, such approaches tend to be computationally expensive or do not take into account the actuators limitations and the safety constraints. For this reason, as well as for the sake of simplicity, in this paper we investigate the design of classic PID controllers to control the acceleration of vehicles equipped with Automated Driving Systems. We consider that each vehicle updates its acceleration according to a car-following model with specific behavioural parameters, thereby accounting for the variability of drivers' behaviours, and we assume that the longitudinal acceleration dynamics of only a proportion of vehicles can be controlled. After linearising the system about its equilibrium state, we show that each vehicle speed to acceleration transfer function reduces to a second order system written as a function of the equilibrium state and the behavioural parameters of the vehicle. We validate this formulation in simulation considering PBRS acceleration inputs.

We then discuss set point weighting to avoid propagation of measurement errors, integrator wind-up to consider limitations of the actuators and safety constraints, and tuning of the controllers.

Consequently, for future Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), precise, lane-accurate localization of the ego- as well as the other vehicles is a key technology. The proposed standard solutions to lane-accurate localization are usually based on expensive detailed 3D maps and precise absolute position estimation sensors. To the contrary, in this paper we propose to improve the localization of scene items based on state-of-the-art map data, combined with a coarse and cheap position estimation as e.g. provided by standard GNSS. From the map data, we infer the structure of the contextual road geometry, and align it with the road view(s) as provided by a front camera. This results in an improved relative positioning of the sensed items on the map structures, allowing a better scene interpretation. The alignment occurs by best-match search based on a feature comparison between the real road view from the camera and virtually generated road views based on the map considering different assumed ego-vehicle positions. On standard road scenes, we validate the approach, and show that it can be used as a cheap means to support intelligent ADAS and improve localization.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795601","","Roads;Cameras;Vehicles;Estimation;Geometry;Sensors;Satellite navigation systems","cameras;image sensors;level measurement;position measurement;satellite navigation","camera;3D map alignment;low-cost lane-level scene interpretation;advanced driver assistance system;ADAS;position estimation sensor;GNSS;contextual road geometry","","1","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the literature, there exists a wide variety of techniques, some complex and some simple and yet effective in particular scenarios. The choice of the path tracker influences the performance in terms of precision, stability and passenger comfort. This paper addresses the lateral control of a self-driving car in an urban environment, where speed is not high but variations in velocity and curvature are frequent. In choosing a lateral controller, simplicity, efficiency and robustness are considered as the main criteria. In this paper, three classical techniques used for controlling the lateral error are analyzed: pure pursuit, Stanley and a simplified kinematic steering control. Additionally, a novel kinematic controller based on the lateral speed is proposed. A home-made realistic simulation environment has been developed to allow rapid testing of the control laws. The relevance of this work has been demonstrated for all controllers through realistic simulations and experiments. The experimental site is the campus of Ecole Centrale de Nantes, where all control laws have been compared along the same path. A longer path, involving a portion of the ring road of Nantes (France) has been simulated. It involves speeds up to 90 km/h, allowing to extrapolate the comparison results to higher velocities.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795743","","Kinematics;Automobiles;Biological system modeling;Roads;Vehicle dynamics;Axles","mobile robots;position control;road vehicles;robot kinematics;stability;steering systems;velocity control","France;Nantes ring road;Ecole Centrale de Nantes;lateral speed;kinematic controller;simplified kinematic steering control;Stanley control;pure pursuit;lateral error;robustness;curvature variation;velocity variation;urban environment;passenger comfort;stability;self-driving car;path tracking;autonomous vehicle;lateral controller","","3","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we design a new PCWS with the AR cues and propose an experimental to evaluate the AR cues by assessing the driver's awareness of a pedestrian. At this stage, a fixed-based driving simulator is used for the study. Twenty five healthy middle-aged licensed drivers participate in the experiment.

State-of-the-art computer vision techniques are used to extract vehicle trajectories automatically from 70 hours of traffic video data at two intersections. More specifically, a modified implementation of the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature tracker is used to extract the feature points and track those feature points frame by frame. The spectral embedding and the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM) are employed to cluster feature points that belong to the same object. The combination of each vehicle's individual trajectory with all the others' trajectories is then screened to identify all the possible vehicle pairs involved in conflict risk. Traffic conflict risks are identified after the time to collision (TTC) is computed for each vehicle pair. Hourly number of conflicts are found to follow a negative binomial distribution similar to number of crashes. A strong correlation is observed between the traffic conflicts and actual crashes, and thus the validity of using conflict data extracted from videos for safety assessment can be confirmed.

However, fully electric bus fleets can prove disadvantageous. We can tackle this with a more conservative approach - using mixed bus fleets, comprised by both electric and conventional buses.

It then provides the driver with a recommendation on the optimal lane selection in terms of traffic conditions.

The question of semi-autonomous driving, where Advanced Driver Assistance Systems assist human drivers in their decisions, will therefore become increasingly important. In this paper, we consider the problem of safe intersection crossing for semi-autonomous vehicles with communication capacities. We design an intersection supervisor based on a mixed-integer quadratic programming approach which monitors the control inputs of each vehicle, and overrides those controls when necessary to ensure that all vehicles can navigate safely. Moreover, the solution control deviates minimally from the vehicles target inputs: overriding only occurs when it is strictly necessary, in which case the control is chosen as close as possible to the driver's intent. We theoretically prove that the supervisor needs only consider a finite future time horizon to ensure safety and deadlock avoidance over an infinite time horizon, and we demonstrate through simulation that this algorithm can work in real time. Additionally, unlike previous work, our formulation is suitable for complex intersection geometries with a high number of vehicles.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795961","","Vehicles;Safety;Roads;Geometry;Merging;Vehicle dynamics;Control systems","integer programming;quadratic programming;vehicular ad hoc networks","complex intersection geometry;infinite time horizon;deadlock avoidance;safety;vehicle navigation;mixed-integer quadratic programming approach;intersection supervisor;communication capacity;advanced driver assistance system;MIQP approach;semiautonomous driving","","2","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We model each traffic participant as a Markov Decision Process in which the cost function is a linear combination of static and dynamic features. In particular, the static features capture the preferences of the driver while the dynamic features, which change over time depending on the actions of the other traffic participants, capture the driver's risk-aversive behavior. Using such a model for prediction enables us to explicitly consider the interactions between traffic participants while keeping the computational complexity quadratic in the number of vehicles in the scene.

Most modern systems rely on annotated spatial maps to provide lane information. However, these maps are not available everywhere, and thus have to be often supported by direct detection systems (e.g. cameras, lasers). Such systems detect lane boundaries by directly observing lane markings or sensing curbstones and pavements. However, well defined boundaries are not always there, or they can be difficult to detect, especially in rural or inner city roads. Furthermore, other traffic participants in the surroundings can significantly limit the field of view of the ego-vehicle. In order to help lane detection in this kind of scenario, indirect cues, such as the behavior of the other vehicles, can be a useful resource. In this paper we propose a grid-based approach, that works on a road terrain representation and assigns a lane and a driving direction to each patch of road. Our approach segments the road terrain into multiple lanes based on geometrical considerations and prior knowledge, and then assigns a driving direction to each lane, taking into account the observed and predicted motion of the other vehicles in the scene. The road terrain is provided by a system we proposed in a previous work, which combines direct and indirect cues to build a probabilistic road representation grid. This new approach constitutes an additional layer to our representation, providing more awareness about the road regulations to motion control systems and allowing them to plan safer trajectories.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795768","","Roads;Vehicles;Sensors;Layout;Trajectory;Probabilistic logic;Radar","geotechnical engineering;probability;road safety;roads","motion control system;probability;grid-based approach;curbstone sensing;pavement sensing;ADAS;lane layout detection;spatial road terrain representation","","1","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Usually, road operators have to conduct time-consuming and therefore costly inspection drives with specialized sensor vehicles gathering high precision measurements. This raises the question whether vehicle-data collected during daily routine drives could replace or at least supplement inspection drives. In this paper we present a prototypical implementation of a road surface condition monitoring system which analyses the vertical acceleration signal from vehicle-mounted accelerometer sensors (physical jerks). The work proposes a linearly referenced road surface condition index (RSCI), being derived from position and accelerometer measurements and being capable of describing vehicle-sensed road surface quality. A road operator supported field trial - using a prototypical system for raw data collection, analysis and integration of the derived road surface condition information into the road operator's legacy systems - was conducted to collect sample data as well as field experiences and to learn about the benefits of such an approach from the perspective of road operators. Results clearly demonstrate that the derived road surface condition information (RSCI, heavy jerks) is able to supplement existing maintenance information and provides a valuable additional data source for road operators by helping to focus monitoring and maintenance tasks. Beside the general applicability, several challenges and refinements on the way to a fully operational system have been identified.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795917","","Roads;Accelerometers;Vehicles;Inspection;Condition monitoring;Acceleration","acceleration measurement;accelerometers;condition monitoring;inspection;maintenance engineering;position measurement;sensors;surface topography measurement","road maintenance;vehicle-data collection;inspection;road surface condition monitoring system;vertical acceleration signal analysis;vehicle-mounted accelerometer sensor;linearly referenced road surface condition index;RSCI;accelerometer measurement;position measurement;vehicle-sensed road surface quality;data analysis","","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its conclusions apply both to manned vehicles in which human drivers follow app directions, and unmanned vehicles following shortest path algorithms. To address the problem caused by the increased usage of routing apps, we model two distinct classes of users, one having limited knowledge of low-capacity road links. This approach is in sharp contrast with some previous studies assuming that each user has full knowledge of the network and optimizes his/her own travel time. We show that the increased usage of GPS routing provides a lot of benefits on the road network of Los Angeles, such as decrease in average travel times and total vehicle miles traveled. However, this global increased efficiency in urban mobility has negative impacts as well, which are not addressed by the scientific community: increase in traffic in cities bordering highway from users taking local routes to avoid congestion.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795614","","Roads;Vehicles;Routing;Navigation;Games;Urban areas","game theory;Global Positioning System;vehicle routing","GPS-enabled routing application;game theoretical approach;low-capacity road link;road network;Los Angeles;urban mobility;highway","","6","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, accurate prediction of the duration of such events is critical for traffic management authorities. In this paper, we study the predictability of the duration of traffic incidents by considering various external factors. As incident data is typically sparse, training a large number of models (for instance, model for each road) is not possible. On the other hand, training one model for the entire network may not be a suitable solution, as such a model will be too generalized and consequently unsuitable for many relatively rare scenarios. Therefore, we propose to solve this issue by first grouping incidents through common latent similarities among them and then training data-driven predictors for each group. In our numerical analysis we consider incident data from Singapore and the Netherlands. Our results show that by training cluster-specific models we can reduce the prediction error by 19.41% for incidents in Singapore and by 17.8% for incidents in the Netherlands.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795759","","Accidents;Electric breakdown;Predictive models;Vehicles;Roads;Meteorology;Training","pattern clustering;road traffic;traffic information systems","nonrecurring road incidents;cluster-specific models;metropolitan areas;nonrecurring traffic incidents;traffic management authorities;common latent similarities;data-driven predictors;Singapore;Netherlands","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior research has shown that without taking individual factors such as time pressure or social status into account, cooperation-acceptance rates were as high as 88% for the left-lane and 100% for the right-lane scenario [1]. Assuming that it influences cooperative behavior, we added time pressure to the experimental setting in this study. We developed and implemented a motivational trade-off concept to counteract an expected drop in acceptance rates for lane-change cooperation under time pressure. Experimental conditions with and without the trade-off concept were tested in a driving-simulator experiment and the results were compared to those of the prior study. They confirmed the drop in acceptance rates under time pressure for the left-lane perspective; however, introducing the concept increased acceptance rates for the left-lane, and decreased them for the right-lane perspective. Using the gamified concept, drivers form cooperative strategies and trade time for points-which equals the unbalanced lane change. Besides being motivational, the trade-off concept is able to shape cooperative behavior.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795662","","Vehicles;Games;Roads;Automation;Safety;Monitoring","cooperative systems;traffic engineering computing","gamification;human cooperation;lane-change scenario;driving-simulator experiment;cooperation-acceptance rate;automated environment;driver cooperation motivation","","5","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rider safety strongly depends on the individual abilities and skills of the rider. To improve the riders' skill level and reduce riding errors, safety trainings are well established. Additionally, safety systems and recently also advanced rider assistance systems help to avoid or mitigate accidents. While conventional rider training is limited to a small number of training scenarios in a controlled environment, safety systems are typically limited to specific situations (collision warning) or physical limits of the vehicle (ABS). We propose a method to identify riding errors based on a statistical rider model for cornering scenarios and estimate a personal rider skill score. The intention is to extend rider skill training beyond organized events and towards personal self-training. Automatic scoring of the cornering skill level has to take into account the high variability in speed and local curvature as well as the variety of different traffic situations that may be encountered during a ride. We suggest to split the complex driving task e.g. riding along a winding road, into smaller control tasks e.g. roll-into-corner, stable lean, and roll-out-of-corner and analyze them separately first, then their sequence and transitions. We evaluate various approaches based on Hidden Markov models that can split a complex task into smaller segments and show indicators for rider skill based on the best segmentation model.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795583","","Hidden Markov models;Training;Roads;Motorcycles;Vehicle dynamics;Safety","human factors;motorcycles;probability;road safety","rider skill identification;probabilistic segmentation;motorcycle maneuver primitives;static instability;dynamic instability;rider safety;safety systems;riding error identification;statistical rider model;personal self-training;automatic scoring","","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can be seen in some practical situations such as public transport in rural areas, wherein in some situations, there is no way to predict demand. This paper addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem with Demand Responsive Transport (VRPDRT), a type of transport which enables customers to be taken to their destination like a taxi or minibus in order to reduce operating costs and to meet customer needs. A multiobjective approach is proposed to VRPDRT in which five different objective functions are used. These functions are aggregated in three new functions resulting in a three-objective formulation for VRPDRT. When using a three objective approach, that formulation allows a better understanding of the company and human perspectives while permitting to solve the resulting problem in an efficient way. The proposed three-objective optimization problem is solved using a random method of generating solutions and an algorithm considered state of the art, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The sets of solutions are compared using the Set Coverage Metric.

Particularly, transport planning and operations in large events are well known to be a challenge. Not only they imply stress to the system on an irregular basis, their associated mobility behavior is also difficult to predict. Previous studies have shown a strong correlation between number of public transport arrivals with the semi-structured data mined from online announcement websites. However, these models tend to be complex in form and demand substantial information retrieval, extraction and data cleaning work, and so they are difficult to generalize from city to city. In contrast, this paper focuses on enriching previously mined information about special events using automated web search queries. Since this context data comes in unstructured natural language form, we employ supervised topic model to correlate it with real measurements of transport usage. In this way, the proposed approach is more generic and a transit agency can start planning ahead as early as the event is announced on the web.

As opposed to classical DEM creation algorithms, the proposed solution uses the sensor models of the stereovision sensor to correct the raw data. The direct and inverse sensor models are found from experiments. The algorithm decomposes the 2D cells containing vertical objects or object boundaries in order to model the objects more precisely. The approach distinguishes between 2 types of cells: cells containing horizontal and vertical objects. For the vertical object cells, connected components in the histogram of heights are found while in the horizontal object cells, the most representative height is determined using a mode-seeking approach similar to mean shift. The 3D reconstructed points are assigned to the cells around it by considering the probability of correspondence based on the 2D Gaussian component of the direct sensor model. In order to eliminate the noise, a similarity measure is computed between each 3D point and cell based on the calculated DEM cell descriptor and is discarded if the similarity score is smaller than a predefined threshold. The algorithm is implemented on the GPU in order to achieve a real-time execution speed and it is evaluated extensively in comparison with other DEM creation algorithms using the latest KITTI stereo benchmark data.

However, the lack of publicly available driving data currently limits the progress on this field. Machine learning techniques could highly enhance research, but they rely on large amounts of data which are difficult and very costly to obtain through Naturalistic Driving Studies (NDSs), resulting in limited accessibility to the general research community. Additionally, the proliferation of smartphones has provided a cheap and easy-to-deploy platform for driver behavior sensing, but existing applications do not provide open access to their data. For these reasons, this paper presents the UAH-DriveSet, a public dataset that allows deep driving analysis by providing a large amount of data captured by our driving monitoring app DriveSafe.

In this paper, by following the idea of consensus, we propose a distributed control strategy to reach local consensus for the links thus to balance the traffic of the whole network. In view of the spatial and temporal characteristics of congestion propagation, the states of links are optimized to reach consensus with their neighbors. The simple linear model makes it possible for the algorithm to implement in large scale urban traffic networks. Furthermore, being realised in a distributed way, the extendibility and flexibility of the control strategy is achieved.

Traffic congestion and traffic accidents are the most visible challenges which are caused by different underlying factors. Two chief factors are poorly planned and maintained roadway infrastructure and the decisions made by the drivers. Drivers are constantly forced to negotiate road hazards, like potholes, unlabeled speed bumps as well as moving obstacles, like pushcarts, motorcycles, and animals. Current Usage Based Insurance (UBI) models do not include the context which in many cities may be paramount to understanding driver behavior. This article presents the Context-based Driver Score (CDS) model as a unified model for scoring a driver based on a unique formulation of context that includes road quality. We demonstrate the CDS model on a real-world use case in Nairobi, Kenya, where waste-collection trucks were instrumented with smartphones in order to collect inertial and telematic data. We present an analysis of the CDS model and driver behaviors in contexts that include weather, time-of-day, and road quality. Our results show that the distribution of driving behaviors, like harsh braking and swerving, vary greatly based on the context and the definition of the CDS model. Ultimately, this work aims to extend the utility and scalability of UBI models in order to make them more suitable for deployment in developing cities.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795626","","Vehicles;Context;Roads;Insurance;Context modeling;Urban areas;Biological system modeling","brakes;road vehicles;smart phones","motorcycle;usage based insurance model;UBI model;CDS model;context-based driver score model;road quality;Kenya;waste-collection truck;smartphone;telematic data;brake;pushcart;traffic accident;traffic congestion;Nairobi","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More specifically, we explored differences between our bid-based control model and various actuated control models. The comparisons include situations where maximum greens are imposed in actuated control, and situations where they are not. To incorporate these ideas, two bid-based (b1, and b2) and four actuated (a1, a2, a3, and a4) control options are considered. Simulation experiments have been conducted to test these ideas for an intersection with two one-way, one-lane approaches, one eastbound and one northbound. Here are some of the inferences that can be drawn: 1) with actuated control, vehicles on the NB approach, with the larger volumes, always experience higher delays than the EB approach, while the differences between the NB and EB approaches are less significant for bid-based control; 2) Actuated control scenarios where maximum green are imposed (a2, a4) produced lower delay distributions than the scenarios where they are not imposed (a1, a3); 3) it is possible to find a combination of max-greens for a given flow condition that allow the actuated controller to match the performance (at least in terms of delays) of bid-based control; 4) bid-based control produced cycle length distributions that are smaller than those produced by various actuated control models; 5) Actuated control scenarios where maximum green are imposed (a2, a4) produced lower cycle length distributions than the scenarios where they are not imposed (a1, a3).","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795758","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795758","","Vehicles;Games;Detectors;Delays;Control systems;Process control;Electronic mail","traffic control;vehicles","bid-based control strategy;actuated based control strategy;economic theory principles;control theory principles;one-way one-lane approach;NB approach;northbound approach;eastbound approach;EB approach;delay distributions;flow condition;signalized traffic control;vehicles","","1","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More critically, there is a fundamental need for a standard that would enable knowledge sharing/exchanging among the different entities, e.g., between on-board sensors, in-vehicle controls and traffic management agencies. This paper proposes an Ontology for Context Modelling (OCM) to be used as the world model for driving context representation and reasoning, which can enable a better understanding of traffic context and sensor capability, which is the basis for providing data source to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communications and even driving decision making within autonomous vehicles. Through the experiments, we evaluate the capability of the OCM to represent the driving context and the reasoning mechanism to compensate for sensor failures and recognize lane changing and overtaking events.

In order to ensure that an autonomous vehicle of the future will perform like human drivers, this paper proposes a vehicle motion planning model, which can represent how drivers control vehicles based on the assessment of traffic environments in the real signalized intersection. The proposed motion planning model comprises functions of pedestrian intention detection, gap detection and vehicle dynamic control. The three functions are constructed based on the analysis of actual data collected from real traffic environments. Finally, this paper demonstrates the performance of the proposed method by comparing the behaviors of our model with the behaviors of real pedestrians and human drivers. The experimental results show that our proposed model can achieve 85% recognition rate for the pedestrian crossing intention.

Movement managers bid for green time for their respective turning movements. Arriving motorists pay fees so the movement managers can bid for discharge slots. Movement managers pay the municipality what they bid when use of the intersections space is contested; otherwise, they pay a nominal fee.

The problem is hard due to challenges from weather and illumination variation. To facilitate the research against such challenges, in this paper we present a new benchmark for cross-weather traffic scene understanding<sup>1</sup>. The dataset consists of 1,356 traffic scene images collected at 226 different locations. For each location, there are six images taken by a vehicle mounted camera under different weather/illumination conditions including sunny day, night, snowy day, rainy night and cloudy days.

This paper proposes a novel binary supervised learning method to classify congestion predictions regarding their causes - CJAMmer. It leverages on heterogeneous and ubiquitous data sources - such as weather, flow counts and traffic incident event logs - to generalize decision models able to understand the road congestion nature. CJAMmer settles on boosted decision trees using the well-known C4.5, as well as a straightforward feature generation process.

The current study explores whether CV trajectory data (based on the crowdsourcing of timestamped vehicle and mobile device locations) can currently be used for this purpose. The study compares in-pavement detector data with “virtual” detector line data based on geo-fencing of trajectory splines. The Purdue Coordination Diagram (PCD), arrival flow profile, and cumulative arrival performance measures are used to assess and compare both data sources. The comparisons indicate that percent on green (POG) estimates from CV trajectories come within 0.1 to 15.7% of the in-pavement detector data, with the highest accuracy attributing to time-of-day periods with moderate traffic and high POG.

The appeal lies in the complexity of these problems, which are NP-hard and NP-complete. In 2015, Iori and Riera-Ledesma formulated and proposed an exact solution for the Double Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Stacks (DVRPMS). The objective is to generate routes with the lowest cost possible, that gather products in a pickup region and drop them in their respective points in the delivery region, without changing the loading plan. In this paper we propose a heuristic approach based on the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic with an additional Local Search. The proposed approach was tested using instances defined in the literature and compared with all known approaches of the DVRPMS. Compared to current heuristic approaches, the SA+LS heuristic found better results in 84.6% of all instances. Analyzing the exact method, the SA+LS heuristic was 61.3% more efficient on find the optimal solution. The proposed approach was proved to be highly competitive when compared to the exact methods, outperforming the exact method in time and finding better solutions than the upper-bounds found in the literature.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795726","","Vehicles;Simulated annealing;Containers;Loading;Complexity theory;Vehicle routing","computational complexity;search problems;simulated annealing;vehicle routing","simulated annealing metaheuristic approach;loading constraint;NP-hard problem;NP-complete problem;double vehicle routing problem with multiple stack;DVRPMS;local search;SA+LS heuristic approach","","2","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A vital step in extracting these higher level information is to find the driver's face and individual components such as eyes, nose and mouth, along with the direction they are facing towards. In the context of safety critical situation like driving, it is important that this vital step be robust otherwise the higher level information is not available or unreliable. The lighting condition of a driver's cabin varies greatly from dark due to driving under a bridge or in a parking structure to extremely bright on a sunny day. Various occlusions on the face may also occur due to hand activities such as drinking water or different gestures. This work introduces a system based on existing CNN structures with slight modifications to implement face detection, landmark localization, and landmark-based head pose estimation method which addresses the challenges found in the driver cabin.

Existing ambiguous path identification research is heavily dependent on vehicle detection sensors, and traffic assignment models using simulations. In this paper, we present a new approach to reveal an important fact: for the majority of traffic, compared with selecting shortest , the distance travel cost of selecting the alternative path is far from the acceptable level in reality. We define a new index that measures the path selection ambiguity that represents the ratio of cost difference. With the real-world O-D (origin-destination) tollgate data, we examine the overall path selection ambiguity problem from both topological and traffic demand perspectives across three major highway networks in China. As a whole, only a small minority of the traffic demand is distributed on the O-D pairs with a great uncertainty concerning route selection. Hence, this paper suggests the shortest path should be considered as the acceptable route taken by individuals in a highway analysis when only O-D data is available.

Methods able to encode occupancy information and to manage perception uncertainty in dynamic environments are quite well known but very few studies have been carried out on encoding semantic information in grids. This kind of information can be crucial in many situations in order to make the vehicle able to follow basic road rules, such as lane keeping or lane changes. Usual approaches often detect lane markings using on-board cameras or lidars but the problem is tricky when the road is multi-lane or in challenging weather conditions. In this work, we propose to tackle this problem by using a vectorial prior map that stores detailed lane level information. From a given pose estimate provided by a localization system, we propose an evidential model that encodes lane information into grids by propagating the pose uncertainty on every cell. This evidential model is compared with a classical Bayesian one and some of its special characteristics are highlighted.

In order to better assess the new generation of air traffic services, this paper presents a simulation/emulation framework based on open source tools to able to evaluate the effects of cyber-attacks and network/communication failures on Air Traffic Control. It presents a case study on Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) technology, with real implementations of cyber-attacks at the link layer. Furthermore, mitigation/defense mechanisms are also evaluated from a mission-assurance perspective.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795988","","Aircraft;Atmospheric modeling;Surveillance;Emulation;Security;Kinetic theory;Radar","air traffic control;aircraft communication;broadcast communication;control engineering computing;public domain software;surveillance;telecommunication network reliability","mission-assurance perspective;mitigation-defense mechanism;ADS-B technology;automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast technology;network-communication failure;cyber-attack simulation;open source tool;simulation-emulation framework;air traffic service;flight delay;air disaster;ATC;security vulnerability;safety;air traffic control;integrated mission","","2","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The impact of secondary tasks on drivers during naturalistic driving: Analysis of EEG dynamics","V. Alizadeh; O.

Driving is a complex task and demands continuous visual and cognitive attention on the primary task of driving. Drivers are at risk of responding more slowly or less suitable to intricate and dynamically changing situations that entail their complete attention. Therefore, monitoring and detection of driver distraction can directly facilitate decreasing the costs associated with roadway disasters. There has been much research effort toward developing automatic detectors of drivers' distraction state. Many approaches were based on analyzing the driving behavior or using camera-based techniques to monitor and evaluate driver distraction. However, besides the issues with privacy and consumer adoption, there are limitations with how early they can detect the signs of distraction. Neurophysiological signals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain activity analysis have been extensively used to understand the precursors of distraction at the physiological level to develop systems to alert the drivers well in advance. The objective of this study is to take a step toward establishing a systematic framework to extract effective descriptors and to measure the impact of in-vehicle secondary tasks on driver cognitive state during naturalistic driving by capturing the changes in EEG dynamics. We employed our wearable data acquisition platform to collect wireless EEG data from six subjects during a naturalistic driving session and investigated six potentially distracting stimuli. We present a standard analysis framework to examine the impact of various EEG signal pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification methods in order to detect driver engagement in a secondary task with high accuracy (98.99 ± 1.2%) solely based on their recorded EEG.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795957","","Vehicles;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Biomedical monitoring;Fractals;Monitoring;Discrete wavelet transforms","electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;signal classification","driver distraction monitoring;roadway disaster;camera-based technique;electroencephalogram;brain activity analysis;neurophysiological signal;in-vehicle secondary task;driver cognitive state;wireless EEG data collection;EEG signal pre-processing;feature extraction;signal classification method;EEG recording","","5","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The oscillating magnetic field of each primary coil is individually enabled when a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag on board of the e-bike is detected and authenticated by an auxiliary coil laying close to that primary coil. On the e-bike, energy for the powertrain is harvested from the lane by a secondary coil that is installed around its rear wheel.

Particularly, the temporal lags in the modified STARIMA change with the time-varying speed at different time of the day or equivalently change with the (time-varying) time required to travel between two measurement points. Firstly, a technique is developed to evaluate the temporal lag in the STARIMA model, where the temporal lag is formulated as a function of the spatial lag (spatial distance) and the average speed. Secondly, an unsupervised classification algorithm based on ISODATA algorithm is designed to classify different time periods of the day according to the variation of the speed. The classification helps to determine the appropriate time lag to use in the STARIMA model. Finally, a STARIMA-based model with time-varying lags is developed for short-term traffic prediction.

On one hand, a CNN framework via gradual up-sampling is introduced, where robust and accurate detection results are achieved. Before applying the CNN model, we also design pre-processing steps, including point clouds registration, the road surface segmentation and orthogonal projection. On the other hand, we propose to analyze the layout of lanes by utilizing the global information and domain knowledge. Hence, false detections caused by ground arrows and texts could be eliminated. Visual and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795954","","Three-dimensional displays;Roads;Color;Robustness;Layout;Videos;Neural networks","computerised instrumentation;convolution;neural nets;sensors","orthogonal projection;road surface segmentation;point cloud registration;CNN model;gradual up-sampling;occlusion;illumination variation;color image processing;HAD map;highly automated driving map;convolution neural network model;lane marking detection","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A better understanding of the displacements over a land is an issue for decision making and territorial planning. The primary objective of this paper is to transform census data towards a disaggregated form, allowing its merging with other mobility data. Most of Human displacements are linked to Home and Work locations, and these commuting patterns regularly generate road congestion problems. Knowing the temporality of commuting patterns eases the decision making processes from local authorities. Mobility censuses often contain these Home and Work information, but are temporally aggregated. We thus propose a machine learning model that learns the temporal distribution of displacements from other mobility sources and allows to temporally disaggregate the displacements of such censuses. This model have been validated and showed its efficiency in a real context. The main advantage of our approach is that the resulting matrices inherit all the attributes contained in the aggregated census. Finally, the model is optimized so that it can be applied to other places wherever censuses on mobility data are available, and without additional computations.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795783","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795783","","Data models;Sociology;Statistics;High-temperature superconductors;Context;Urban areas;Manganese","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);local government;matrix algebra;public administration;road traffic","temporal displacement distribution;machine learning model;local authorities;decision making process;road congestion problems;work locations;home locations;human displacements;territorial planning;decision making;population mobility data;temporal disaggregated origin-destination matrices;transfer learning;mobility data disaggregation","","1","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On one hand, under Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) realm, changing pseudonyms has been the state-of-the-art; however, to avoid being tracked, the vehicle has to change the pseudonym when it is within a fixed or a dynamic mix zone, created using encryption or silent periods. On the other hand, under the group signature realm, super anonymity is afforded for vehicles but at the expense of slow signature verification. To benefit from the super anonymity of an optimized hybrid group signature authentication, we suggest the idea of altering authentication to form the dynamic mix crowd for an originating vehicle that needs to change its pseudonym. Our scheme has neither silent periods nor encryption; it simply utilizes the new authentication as a dynamic hiding cover for the pseudonyms changing; once the pseudonym is altered, the vehicle watches for at least one other change by any cooperative neighbor in the formed zone before it automatically demolishes the group by reverting back to the baseline authentication. Our analysis shows the easiness of forming and demolishing the dynamic groups, it proves the validity of the model by satisfying the needed vehicular security requirements, and shows acceptable performance in comparison with the baseline authentication scheme.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795607","VANETs;Location-Privacy;Pseudonyms;Authentication;Mix-Zone;Anonymity;Tracking","Vehicles;Authentication;Vehicle dynamics;Public key;Privacy;Encryption;Roads","data privacy;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","baseline authentication scheme;vehicular security requirement;dynamic hiding cover;optimized hybrid group signature authentication;slow signature verification;encryption;pseudonym;PKI;public key infrastructure;anonymous authentication dynamic mixing crowd;vehicular network;location privacy preservation","","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to limit the vehicle to a speed trajectory that follows the normal traffic flow, data from real truck operation have been analysed and used for setting upper and lower boundaries for the decelerations. To evaluate the solution, simulations have been performed on a segment of a road normally used as a distribution test cycle.

Previous studies have explored various methods of compressing point cloud data directly by converting it into 2D images or by using tree-based approaches. In this study, rather than compress point cloud data directly, we choose to compress packet data which is raw point cloud data, by converting it losslessly into range images, and then using various image/video compression algorithms to reduce the volume of the data. In this paper, four methods, which are based on MPEG, JPEG and two kinds of preprocessing approaches for each method, are evaluated for range images compression. PSNR V.S Bitrate and RMSE V.S Bitrate are used to compare and evaluate the performance of these four methods.

Few research efforts have been done to conduct the analytic calculation of delay, with which optimization of timing plans can be acquired more efficiently. This paper first develops the control strategies based on the introduction of overlap and offset analysis, which provide a uniform representation of sequences for DDI signal control. Considering the difference of delay calculation between DDI and isolated intersections, as the inflows will serve either as saturated flow or arrival rate from either upstream ramp or arterial, delay equations were developed to calculate the delay on the internal lanes of DDI, which can be used for all different undersaturated traffic. Finally, 39 different traffic patterns that each with 10 decision variables created from JMP are used to check the accuracy of the calculations using VISSIM software. The results show the calculation fit simulation very well with R-Square to be 0.9968 for delay calculation of westbound internal lane, 0.9914 for eastbound internal lane, and 0.9949 for total delay of those two directions. By changing the pre-determined parameters such as the length of internal lanes, saturated flow rate of upstream approach, desired speed, all-red and amber time, the equations proposed in the paper are actually able to take all kinds of configurations of DDI into consideration and get the optimized timing plan easily with commercial solvers.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795613","DDI;delay;internal lane;timing plan;patterns","Delays;Diamond;Vehicles;Optimization;Traffic control;Safety","decision theory;delays;digital simulation;optimisation;traffic engineering computing","macroscopic calculation;delay calculation;diverging diamond interchanges;timing plan optimization;control strategies;offset analysis;overlap analysis;DDI signal control;isolated intersections;delay equations;traffic patterns;decision variables;JMP;VISSIM software;westbound internal lane;eastbound internal lane;internal lane length;amber time","","","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, the most time-efficient traffic flow models are based on the macroscopic approach to describe traffic dynamics. Macroscopic models reproduce the evolution of aggregated traffic characteristics over time and space with respect to observable variables, such as flow and speed, requiring much less computational time, compared to microscopic ones. This work assesses a second-order macroscopic gas-kinetic traffic flow (GKT) model and its numerical implementation using real traffic data from a motorway network in the U.K., where recurrent congestion originated from high on-ramp flows during the morning peak hours is observed.

In this paper we present an idea that may dramatically fasten and streamline this process. The idea is to build a fast search index (COSI: COngestion Search engIne) based on meta data in combination with features from the traffic patterns along routes. Instead of ploughing through the raw detector data, COSI makes it possible to search through higher level traffic (congestion) patterns. This paper explores a first step in developing COSI: a method to classify traffic congestion patterns reconstructed with the well known adaptive smoothing method. We demonstrate the method using a preliminary set of loop detector data in the Netherlands. We extract and store individual traffic congestion patterns of these regions as images. We then use SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) to identify the descriptors vector of each image, and apply the bag-of-features technique to generate low-dimensional representation vectors for them. Finally, we use a multiclass extended SVM algorithm to classify these patterns. The results of the method are presented and a synthesis of the findings is given.

Although there have been various approaches regarding prior-accident issues, only a few studies have been able to evaluate the impacts after an accident. With the emerging of new traffic sensor technologies, traffic data have exploded. This inspires us to rethink the accident impacts evaluation problem based more on intensive data. Accordingly, a practical data-driven method is proposed in this paper, whose functions are twofold: 1) to identify the flow characteristic of each intersection based on the processed data and then quantify the accident impacts through outlier detection and 2) to evaluate the duration of impacts by means of hazard-based model with heterogeneity. The procedure developed in this paper will be useful for capturing the accident impacts duration at or near urban intersections, as well as identifying the causal factors that affect these impacts, which includes the accident features, road environment and the temporal characteristics of nearby intersections.

These sensors are omnipresent and help the car navigate, reduce accidents, and provide comfortable rides. However, they can also be used to learn about the drivers themselves. In this paper, we propose a method to predict, from sensor data collected at a single turn, the identity of a driver out of a given set of individuals. We cast the problem in terms of time series classification, where our dataset contains sensor readings at one turn, repeated several times by multiple drivers. We build a classifier to find unique patterns in each individual's driving style, which are visible in the data even on such a short road segment. To test our approach, we analyze a new dataset collected by AUDI AG and Audi Electronics Venture, where a fleet of test vehicles was equipped with automotive data loggers storing all sensor readings on real roads. We show that turns are particularly well-suited for detecting variations across drivers, especially when compared to straightaways. We then focus on the 12 most frequently made turns in the dataset, which include rural, urban, highway on-ramps, and more, obtaining accurate identification results and learning useful insights about driver behavior in a variety of settings.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795670","","Automobiles;Roads;Wheels;Prediction algorithms;Acceleration;Time series analysis","automotive electronics;pattern classification;sensors;traffic engineering computing","driver identification;automobile sensor data;single turn;automotive electronics;time series classification;sensor readings;pattern classifier;individual driving style;short road segment;automotive data loggers","","12","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main purpose of this work is to assess two well-known local control policies - Equisaturation and P0 - in terms of network-wide performances. While local control policies are, indeed, key building blocks to network-wide approaches, little effort has been done to evaluate their performances for real-life scenarios. While Equisaturation has been regarded as the most popular local policy, it is also widely accepted that this policy is more `fair' than `efficient'. The main contribution of this paper is to test the properties of these two approaches on a real sized network. The local control policies are employed so to generate a starting point from which further optimization is then performed through a network-wide approach - explicitly maximizing network throughput. In order to ensure a reliable performance evaluation, different random initial points are tested. The contribution is twofold: first, authors compare the two control policies and assess their performances in approximating network-wide approaches. Subsequently, a centralized optimization is performed, to evaluate the impact of generating ad hoc initial points when optimizing multiple intersections.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795668","","Optimization;Throughput;Delays;Traffic control;Facsimile;Linear programming;Mathematical model","optimisation;performance evaluation;road traffic control","centralized optimization;network throughput maximization;equisaturation;assignment problem;road traffic control;local signal control policy;network-wide assessment","","1","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve the problem, traffic scientists have developed a number of time-series speed prediction approaches, including traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. However, existing methods are still unsatisfying due to the difficulty to reflect the stochastic traffic flow characteristics. Recently, various deep learning models have been introduced to the prediction field. In this paper, a deep learning method, the Deep Belief Network (DBN) model, is proposed for short-term traffic speed information prediction. The DBN model is trained in a greedy unsupervised method and fine-tuned by labeled data. Based on traffic speed data collected from one arterial in Beijing, China, the model is trained and tested for different prediction time horizons. From experiment analysis, it is concluded that the DBN can outperform Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for all time horizons.

However, since traffic accidents are sparse events and the factors that lead to an accident can be very diverse, it is difficult to establish a direct link which relates microscopic risk models to the empirical findings. One seminal and widely debated work on accident statistics on multi-lane roadways is given by the so-called “Solomon curve” [1], which describes the collision rate of automobiles as a function of their speed. While one particular characteristic of the Solomon curve - its u-shape - has been explained theoretically in terms of traffic flow of passing cars in [2], a detailed derivation from microscopic risk models is still missing. In this paper, we start from a first-principles generalized risk model, and reconfirm the explanation of the curve, revealing that its parameters can be fully mapped to the parameters of the underlying microscopic risk model. In addition, an unexplained effect of the Solomon curve - the asymmetry of its minimum with respect to the average velocity - is predicted and explained by the derivation. The result then is two-fold: On one hand, we can now fully understand the Solomon curve in terms of microscopic risk parameters, and on the other hand, the empirical findings of the Solomon curve serve as a validation of the risk model and can be used to gain reasonable settings for microscopic risk parameters.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795926","","Accidents;Microscopy;Automobiles;Vehicle crash testing;Roads;Context","risk analysis;road accidents;road safety;statistics","Solomon curve 2020;microscopic risk model;traffic accident statistics;multilane roadway;car;first-principle generalized risk model;average velocity prediction","","1","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main difference between the formulations is that the sampling is done in the temporal domain in the standard formulation, but in the spatial domain for the other. It is shown that it is easy to convert one formulation to the other. Further, it is shown that the formulations are identical under the assumption of constant longitudinal velocity of the controlled vehicle. However, when the longitudinal velocity is not fixed they are not identical, in fact, the temporal formulation becomes a mixed integer problem which is hard to convexify. On the other hand, the spatial formulation can be easily convexified using standard methods.

We distinguish between orchard- and vineyard-like areas and agricultural fields growing, in particular, rapeseed and cereals. For the former application, dynamic programming and label-correcting algorithms are compared and, based on a coordinate transformation, a heuristic is motivated therefore. For the latter agricultural field application, we constrain the shortest path objective by allowing agricultural machinery to only use already existing tractor-lane traces and thus introduce a repressed area minimization constraint.

For this bootstrapping process, we propose to use an incremental learning algorithm from the cognitive robotics domain which is particularly suited for perceptual problems. We apply it to a pedestrian detection problem where a synthetic dataset is used for initial training, and two different real-world datasets for fine-tuning and evaluation. The proposed scheme greatly reduces the number of real-world samples required while maintaining high classification accuracy.

Recent studies point out that an accurate knowledge of the heterogeneity of vehicles behaviour is key to reproducing realistic microscopic simulations. Car-following models are able to capture such heterogeneity via behavioural parameters. Researchers have looked at getting realistic parameters of car-following models using trajectory datasets. It requires data filtering, parameter identification for each leader-follower couple, evaluation of statistical dependencies between the estimated parameters and parameters sampling. However, we have found that the parameter identification part, arguably the most important, is often overlooked, as the parameters that can be estimated, i.e. that are identifiable, highly depend on the leading vehicle trajectory. While global sensitivity analyses help disregard insensitive parameters, there is a need to complement them with a systematic statistical approach to get insights about the robustness of parameters estimates, i.e. the shape of the objective function nearby the estimates. In this paper, we first isolate parameters that can be identified, then perform parameter estimation, and finally verify that the confidence region of the estimates lies within the physical bounds of the parameters. This involves variance-based global sensitivity analyses to reduce the parameter space, log likelihood estimation for point estimation and use of the likelihood-ratio technique for interval estimation. Outputs are distributions of the estimated parameters and of their confidence values, for any investigated car-following models and datasets.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795612","","Trajectory;Vehicles;Estimation;Sensitivity analysis;Linear programming;Robustness","automobiles;parameter estimation;road traffic;sampling methods","parameter estimation;car-following models;practical nonidentifiability;microscopic traffic;vehicle-tailored traffic management;mixed traffic;connected vehicles;autonomous vehicles;vehicles behaviour heterogeneity;behavioural parameters;trajectory datasets;data filtering;parameter identification;leader-follower couple;statistical dependencies;parameters sampling;variance-based global sensitivity analyses;log likelihood estimation;point estimation;likelihood-ratio technique;interval estimation;confidence values","","2","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper extends a recently proposed data-driven approach for SSPP in the following two aspects: (1) when deadline is loose enough, the original method may return more than one paths since all of them meet deadline with 100% probability. We propose to return a unique path with the least number of intersections by reformulating the objective function.

List","The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA; Department of Civil Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, 27695, USA","2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","","2016","","","2131","2136","The assessment of travel time reliability for segments and routes is a rapidly advancing frontier. The increasing availability of probe data is making it possible to monitor reliability in real-time based on individual vehicle data as opposed to ex-post-facto based on averages. This paper examines metrics that can be used to monitor reliability based on probe data. The merits of traditional metrics like the planning time index, buffer index, and travel time index are compared with newer ideas like complete cumulative distribution functions and mean/variance combinations. The question is: what is the quality of information about real-time reliability provided by these various options? This paper compares these metrics in the context of probe-based observations of travel times and rates. Also, a new idea for a pairwise metric, the root mean square travel rate τ<sub>rms</sub>in conjunction with the standard deviation σ<sub>τ</sub>. These two measures in combination seem to provide a picture of reliability that is nearly as complete as the underlying Cumulative Density Function (CDF) and better than the simpler metrics. These ideas are examined in the context of probe data from I-5 in Sacramento, CA.","2153-0017","978-1-5090-1889-5978-1-5090-1888-8978-1-5090-1890","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795901","","Reliability;Measurement;Indexes;Vehicles;Standards;Planning;Context","road traffic;traffic engineering computing","travel time reliability measures;vehicle data;probe data availability;reliability monitoring;probe data;planning time index;buffer index;travel time index;cumulative distribution functions;mean combination;real-time reliability;pairwise metric;root mean square travel rate;standard deviation;cumulative density function;CDF;Sacramento;CA;variance combination","","1","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
