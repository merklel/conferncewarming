Compared with those of high speed machines used for electric vehicles (EV) and refrigerator compressors, the shaft of a spindle motor is always thicker to satisfy the mechanical support requirement. When the overall outer diameter of a spindle motor is further limited for practical use, the rotor space will be restricted on both the inner and outer side, which makes the machine design process a more challenging work. This paper presents a detailed design procedure of a high speed interior PM spindle permanent magnet (PM) motor. With large volume consumption for the shaft, the rotor space is fully utilized by adopting the inverted interior V shaped PM rotor structure. Firstly, the split ratio is optimized for maximum torque density. Then, the rotor parameters, including the magnet thickness, PM pole arc, angle between adjacent PMs and the bridge width are optimized by finite element analysis (FEA). The simulated results show significant improvement on output performance, i.e. the torque density is increased by 22%. Finally, the analysis results are verified by experimental tests on a 11 Nm, 12000RPM prototype machine.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837171","electric spindle;torque density;inverted inter permanent magnet machines;skewing;torque ripple","Torque;Rotors;Permanent magnet motors;Stators;Synchronous motors;Permanent magnets;Harmonic analysis","finite element analysis;machine tool spindles;optimisation;permanent magnet motors;rotors;shafts;synchronous motor drives","optimal design;V-shaped interior PM synchronous machine;narrow rotor space;electric spindle;high speed direct drive spindle motors;spindle motor shaft;mechanical support;machine design process;high speed interior PM spindle permanent magnet motor;inverted interior V shaped PM rotor structure;split ratio optimization;torque density;rotor parameters;magnet thickness;PM pole arc;finite element analysis;FEA;performance improvement","","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, FESSs are investigated for medium voltage applications where the main concern is the FESS's reliability. The main challenge for medium voltage FESS is the driving machine ratings and interfacing power conversion system. Therefore, two-parallel three-phase Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) are proposed to drive an asymmetrical six-phase Induction Machine (IM) in order to reduce the DC link voltage of the medium voltage system into a proper level for the IMs, where each converter is connected to feed each three-phase set of the six-phase machine.

Brushless DC Motor is one of such machine which is now widely used due to compactness of motor and drive unit and replacing large number of conventional machines to a greater extent. The numerous benefits of Brushless DC motors are high torque to weight ratio, higher torque, less inertia and use of electronic commutation. The magnetic fields produced by stator and rotor interact to develop torque. The special construction of stator lamination with concentrated winding are responsible for trapezoidal shape gap flux density distribution and induced EMF. However use of special laminations for stator can be costly with larger material wastage. It is therefore necessary to adopt innovative approach for design of BLDC machine.

It is shown that increasing the number of layers reduces the fundamental winding factor. In consequence, the rated torque for the same current reduces. However, the reduction of harmonics associated with a higher number of layers reduces the ripple torque, PM losses, and iron losses. Besides studying the performance of the AFPMSMs for the rated conditions, the study is broadened for the field weakening (FW) region. During the FW region, the flux of the PMs is weakened by an injection of a reversible d-axis current. This keeps the terminal voltage of the machine fixed at the rated value. The inductance plays an important role in the FW study.

Though PI based control strategy is often used to control the speed of IM, conventional PI controller, in general, has very poor performance in transient response. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is gaining momentum as a controller for nonlinear system. This paper presents the ANN based speed control scheme of IM with considering CL and SLL.

There are mainly two aspect reasons. On one hand, for one given fan motor, the pipeline resistance will change because of the clogging of the filter and other reasons. On the other hand, for different fan motors, the motor efficiencies are not the same. The paper presents a constant air flow control method without using air volume sensor. The method can adjust the air-blower speed automatically to keep a constant air volume by measuring the fan motors parameters under different working conditions in real time. The single-chip XC866 is used as the core of the control system, which controls the output air volume automatically by detecting signals of voltage, current and rotor position. The result proves that a constant output air volume can be achieved under different expected air volume values for fan motors by using the method based on sensorless and it also has a high precision.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837476","air fan motor;constant air volume control;sensorless;pipeline resistance;motor efficiency;automatic regulation","Fans;Pipelines;Resistance;Brushless DC motors","electric motors;fans;sensorless machine control;volume control","constant air volume control system;fan motor parameters;pipeline resistance;filter clogging;motor efficiency;air-blower speed;single-chip XC866;rotor position signal detection;voltage signal detection;current signal detection;sensorless control method","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The PMSM loss predicted by the analytical model can take the copper loss and iron loss into account in magnetic circuit. The nonlinear characteristics of the switching loss and conduction loss in the power converter can be also considered in the nonlinear model. Based on the system loss model, the maximum efficiency control is proposed to make the system maintain maximum efficiency in the whole range of operating conditions for the FES system. The maximum efficiency control can optimize the copper loss, iron loss and power converter loss together. By the use of the SiC MOSFETs, the PMSM system can decrease the switching loss of power devices significantly and increase the efficiency of system.

In order to reduce the capacity of the battery, long term fluctuation component should be reduced. We have proposed a hybrid generation system which is composed of large scale off-shore wind farm with small scale tidal generation system (HOTT; Hybrid Off-shore and Tidal Turbine). The basic concept of HOTT generation system is to compensate wind power fluctuation by controlling the output of tidal generation system. If the tidal power compensates some long-term portion of the wind fluctuation, the battery capacity can be reduced. In this study, for coordinating compensation by the tidal generator and the battery, a control system was designed limiting compensating frequency range by using band pass filter and phase compensation.

The key is that the proposed motor incorporates the concept of fault-tolerant teeth to provide the desired decoupling among phases and adopts surface-mounted permanent magnet to offer symmetric back-EMF and high thrust force. The electromagnetic performances of the newly designed motor are analyzed including the back electromotive force (back-EMF), mutual and self-inductances, fault-tolerance, detent force as well as thrust force. Finite-element analysis (FEA) is employed to verify the theoretical analysis, showing that the proposed motor not only retains the merits of tubular linear machines, but also offers symmetric back-EMF, high flux density, high thrust force and high fault-tolerant capability.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837550","Fault-tolerant;radially magnetized;tubular permanent magnet motor;finite-element analysis (FEA)","Permanent magnet motors;Force;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Suspensions;Windings;Magnetic flux","finite element analysis;linear machines;permanent magnet motors;suspensions (mechanical components)","five-phase fault-tolerant radially magnetized tubular permanent magnet motor;active vehicle suspensions;tubular motors;active vehicle suspension;zero-net radial force;fault-tolerant teeth concept;surface-mounted permanent magnet;symmetric back-EMF;high-thrust force;electromagnetic performances;back electromotive force;mutual inductance;fault-tolerance;detent force;thrust force;finite-element analysis;FEA;theoretical analysis;tubular linear machines;high-flux density;fault-tolerant capability","","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The overshoot problems are the common phenomena occurred in conventional PI based controller. Also the performance is degraded under the variations of motor parameters such as rotor resistance, moment of inertia, etc. To overcome the above mentioned drawbacks of PI based speed controller, in this paper a fuzzy logic based speed controller is proposed.

Especially, when there is a long motor cable between the inverter and motor in some application, voltage reflection makes such phenomenon much more obvious. Overvoltage will lead to the failure of the motor and cable insulation. The LCL filter is often used to make the voltage sinusoidal, suppressing overvoltage. However, the LCL filter may causes the oscillation or resonance at system resonant frequency. One of the methods to solve the problem is passive damping. Although passive damping is simple and reliable, it will result in the loss of power. In this paper, a feasible and simple active damping algorithm for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) vector control system with LCL filter is proposed. The high-frequency component of the inverter side inductor current is multiplied by the virtual resistance to simulate the resistance drop. Meanwhile, the fundamental component of the inductor current inverter side can be used in the motor control. Compared with the traditional active damping, the proposed algorithms can save a set of sensors. The proposed algorithm is irrelevant to the design of standard vector control. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837204","Active damping (AD);LCL filter;long motor cable;vector control","Inverters;Algorithm design and analysis;Inductors;Power harmonic filters;Filtering algorithms;Damping;Passive filters","machine insulation;machine vector control;permanent magnet motors;power cable insulation;PWM invertors;synchronous motor drives","active damping algorithm;output LCL filter;PWM inverter-fed drive system;long-motor cable;motor terminal;inverter output voltage;voltage reflection;cable insulation failure;motor insulation failure;sinusoidal voltage;overvoltage suppression;system resonant frequency;passive damping;permanent magnet synchronous motor;PMSM vector control system;high-frequency component;inverter side inductor current;virtual resistance;resistance drop;inductor current inverter side","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In standalone dc system, parallel dc-dc converters are used to interface storage element and loads. Use of master-slave controller for paralleling is restricted on account of its high cost, low reliability and complexity. Even though conventional droop controllers overwhelmed these limitations, they cannot concurrently ensure equal current sharing and low-voltage regulation. This is attributable to the error in measurement of voltage feedback signal. To address this limitation, modified droop controller based on model predictive control is proposed in this study. This work presents a performance study of a dc micro grid when it is used a voltage droop technique to regulated the bus voltage and to control the load sharing between different sources.

In this paper, the voice coil motor (VCM) is proposed to produce the thrust of automatic transmission. The thrust of the proposed VCM follows the iBl rule, so the magnetic flux density of the winding and the magnetomotive force (mmf) of the armature winding must be large to obtain large thrust. If the mmf is designed to be large, the weight of the VCM must also be large. In this paper, the optimum design was presented that can decrease the weight of the VCM without decreasing the thrust.

The current response to a voltage pulse into the north pole (d<sup>+</sup>) direction of the magnet should be higher in magnitude than into the opposite direction because of increased stator saturation. However, experiments show sometimes an opposite result. The present paper considers the bridge-saturation in the rotor to explain this phenomenon. Finite element (FE) analyses of six modified PMSM models demonstrate that the bridge-saturation decreases, as the flux linkage begins to increase. That leads to an increase of the differential inductance if the stator iron is not strongly saturated. The impact of the machine geometry parameters on the differential inductance is also studied in this paper by means of a sensitivity analysis.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837318","Machine Anisotropy;Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machine;Rotor Polarity Detection;Self-Sensing","Rotors;Stators;Saturation magnetization;Couplings;Inductance;Magnetic flux leakage;Voltage measurement","finite element analysis;permanent magnet machines;rotors;sensitivity analysis;stators;synchronous machines","bridge-saturation;anisotropy-based initial rotor polarity detection;interior permanent-magnet synchronous machines;IPMSM;stator iron;current response;voltage pulse;north pole direction;stator saturation;finite element analysis;FE analysis;modified PMSM model;differential inductance;machine geometry parameters;sensitivity analysis","","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These models are based on the WECC's generic PV system models whose circuit and control modes are modified to build our new PV models. In terms of the circuit, the detailed inner-loop current control model is adopted for the inverter's AC-side model. And we also add the models of elements at inverter's DC side, namely, the PV array model for the one-stage PV plant, and the PV array and boost models for the two-stage PV plant. This difference in the circuit introduces the random factors of PV systems (irradiance and temperature), which are the external factors contributing to the fluctuant PV output. In terms of the control modes, we design a similar reactive power control structure. And we also add two active power control modes for the complete PV circuit. They are the constant DC voltage control and MPPT control. These two control modes are used widely and can make the PV plants track the variations of irradiance and temperature in real time to reach their maximum outputs. So, they are the main internal factors contributing to the fluctuant PV outputs. Thus these models can be used to analyze, assess, and control the power system small-signal stability, especially for the case as affected by the fluctuant PV output due to random irradiance and temperature. Finally, we write these models into the modal analysis and transient simulation programs and then verify their correctness.

The main role of this combination model is to limit the fault current using superconducting technology and supporting the reactive power effectively using STATCOM. Transient stability investigations focus on studying the rotor oscillation of synchronous generators after the event of large unsettling influence. The objective is to demonstrate if the generator stays in synchronism after the fault eliminated. The output power, fault duration and generator rotor angle during the fault period are the most critical factors to be taken into consideration.

In recent years, environmental problems are becoming serious and wind power generation has been attracting much attention and introduced throughout the world due to its low environmental impacts. However, wind power generation is an unstable power source with fluctuating output due to wind speed variations. Thus, when a large amount of wind power generation is connected to the power system, it can decrease power quality, e.g., frequency variations. There are some methods to suppress the frequency fluctuation in the power system, among which ASG can be an effective countermeasure. However, there has not been sufficient report on the frequency control by using ASG. This paper proposes a new output control system for ASG to smooth fluctuating power of the wind farm (WF) which is based on information of the frequency fluctuations of the power system.

To gain insight in phenomena related to these higher harmonics, such as noise and losses, a good understanding of the magnetic field's harmonic content is mandatory. Moreover, the development of highly-accurate analytical models requires a qualitative knowledge of the machine's harmonic content. Therefore this work aims at studying the harmonic content of synchronous electrical machines. To do so the three aspects that determine the harmonic content of the machine's magnetic field are discussed: the excitation source, the stator-current density and the geometry. Based on that discussion, general expressions for the time- and spatial-harmonic combinations are formulated. These expressions are proven to be valid for a very broad range of synchronous machines.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837518","","Harmonic analysis;Magnetic separation;Windings;Stator windings;Saturation magnetization;Current density","geometry;harmonics;stators;synchronous machines","time-harmonic content;spatial-harmonic content;synchronous electrical machines;magnetic field harmonic content;excitation source;stator-current density;geometry","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, CSR is operated in PWM and VSI is operated in the six-step operation mode. Consequently, the switching loss of VSI is reduced as compared with the PWM operation due to the conventional six-step operation mode. In addition, the input current total harmonic distortion (THD) is improved as compared with the conventional six-step operation because the CSR modulation is PWM. In the experimental result, the input current THD of the hybrid six-step operation is improved by 76.0 % compared to the conventional six-step operation.

In this paper, the types of sensor faults are divided into three kinds according to the number of faulted sensors. Here, the amount and position of faulted elements are identified based on the output signals, with improved orthogonal Phase Locked Loop. Single and double sensor faults in this case are analyzed, and corresponding solutions are also present to guarantee the continuous operation of PMSM within a certain period.

For commutation discrete position information is necessary. This feedback is often provided by Hall sensors instead of more expensive encoders. However, even small misalignment of the Hall sensors in low cost BLDC motors can lead to unwanted torque ripples or reduced performance of BLDC motors. This misplacement leads not only to noise and vibrations caused by the torque ripples but also to lower efficiency. In this paper, a self-sensing technique to assess the misalignment is introduced. The objective is to obtain knowledge of the quality of the commutation by quantifying the misalignment. The method used in this paper is based on the fundamental components of voltage and current measurements and only needs the available current and voltage signals and electrical parameters such as resistance and inductance to estimate the misalignment.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837437","Brushless DC motor;commutation;Hall sensors;load angle estimation;SDFT","Sensors;Commutation;Torque;Estimation;Stator windings;DC motors;Hysteresis motors","brushless DC motors;electric current measurement;electric sensing devices;voltage measurement","commutation error;BLDC machine;sensorless load angle estimation;BLDC motors;unwanted torque ripples;self-sensing technique;misalignment assessment;voltage measurement;current measurement;current signal;voltage signal;electrical parameters;resistance;inductance;Hall sensors;pumps;ventilators;refrigerators","","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After analyzing the basic working principle of the cascaded H-bridge multilevel SSSC, a hierarchical control strategy with multiple control loops is proposed in this paper. At the system level, the constant impedance compensation scheme is adopted, which generates the reactive voltage reference for the converter. At the converter level, the double-loop control with the outer capacitor voltage loop and the inner inductor current loop is used. For the capacitor voltage balancing scheme designed for the active power balance, the overall balance and the individual balance are enough for the star-configured cascaded H-bridge converter. According to the whole set of control strategy, the voltage reference for each H-bridge cell can be generated. Then carrier phase shift modulation is used to generate the control signals for each cells. This proposed hierarchical control strategy is simple and very easy to be realized.

In addition, the fundamental voltage of the inverter can be effectively improved with overmodulation algorithm. However, the classical overmodulation algorithm for space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) needs to store a lot of data in advance and the control precision is not perfect. Considering the above two reasons, this paper presents the synchronized SVPWM strategy in the overmodulation region using superposition principle. Consequently, the equivalent carrier-based modulated functions of the strategies in the overmodulation mode I and II are derived respectively based on the regular sampling rules of carrier-based pulse width modulation.

Thus, they can reduce harmonics and EMI. From the practical point of view, implementation of the source of multilevel voltage without increase in the volume of the converters is strongly desired. In this context, the flying capacitor multilevel converters are most promising candidates for the practical multilevel converters. AC motor drive is one of typical applications of inverters. In this case, the additional losses caused by the harmonics in the inverter outputs often become practical problems. As a solution to these problems, the multilevel inverters are expected to reduce the harmonic losses. As the number of output levels in the multilevel inverters increases, the harmonics of the output current further decrease. However, the losses in the inverter may increase due to the number of the circuit components in the paths of the main currents will increase. In this paper, as a guideline to minimize the total losses of the multilevel inverters and the motors, we investigate the loss components in the flying capacitor multilevel inverters and induction motors for several different number of the output levels under various operating conditions.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837419","Multi-level inverter;Flying capacitor;Harmonics;AC motor drive","Inverters;Capacitors;Induction motors;Switches;Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters;Motor drives","harmonics suppression;induction motor drives;invertors;power capacitors","flying capacitor multilevel inverter;internal voltage source;multilevel output voltage source;EMI;flying capacitor multilevel converter;AC motor drive system;harmonic loss reduction;induction motor","","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the output current is increased for achieving the high power density, the stray load loss at the stator end region is increased by the leakage flux from the armature and field coils. Therefore, in the case that the stray load loss at the stator end region is increased when the output capacity is increased, it is necessary to evaluate the temperature under the condition of the leading power factor load. In this paper, we analyzed the loss density distribution at the end region structures using the large-scale 3D electromagnetic field analysis to establish the temperature reliability in the 870MVA indirectly hydrogen cooled machine, which is the largest class capacity in the world.

The rotor position of an SRM is estimated by substituting a differential value of sampled current (differential current) into the motor model. The position estimation accuracy is dependent on the sensitivity of the differential current to the position. However, the sensitivity is affected by a combination of three-phase voltages in an SRM with mutual-inductance. The combination of three-phase voltage shifts in a pulse width modulation PWM period. Therefore, the proposed system adjusts the A/D sampling timing of the differential current in accordance with the combination of three-phase voltages in a PWM period. The adjustment of the A/D sampling timing increases the sensitivity of the differential current to the position and decreases the position estimation error.

Their popularity therefore is steadily increasing. Without a proper design, however, the induced eddy-current losses in the solid rotor get rather high. The modeling and the prediction of eddy-current losses for these machines are thus very important during the design process. This paper focuses on the finite-element analysis and the experimental validation of eddy-current losses for this kind of machine with a small axial length. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional transient finite-element models are developed for computing the eddy-current losses. The rotor motion is taken into account using an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation. The total iron losses are measured experimentally and a method to separate the rotor iron losses from the total iron losses is presented. The validation results show that the two-dimensional finite-element model overestimates the losses due to the end-effects being neglected. The three-dimensional model agrees much better with the measurements in both no-load and on-load operations.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837506","Concentrated winding;eddy current losses;experimental validation;permanent magnet machine","Iron;Mathematical model;Rotors;Loss measurement;Stators;Magnetic domains;Solid modeling","eddy current losses;finite element analysis;permanent magnet machines;rotors","finite element analysis;eddy current loss modeling;permanent magnet machines;fractional-slot concentrated windings;eddy current loss prediction;design process;axial length;two-dimensional transient finite-element models;three-dimensional transient finite-element models;rotor motion;arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation;rotor iron losses;total iron losses;no-load operation;on-load operation","","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A new design concept of PMSM for flux weakening was presented. D-axis inductance is smaller than q-axis inductance is regarded as common sense for PM motor, but a special permanent-magnet sheath changes it. The permanent-magent sheath in rotor makes a posibility of Ld&gt;Lq for a PM motor. Flux-weakening priciple and control method of the PMSM with Ld&gt;Lq are different from traditonal PMSM. The speed range above the rated speed is not only widened for the new PMSM, but also the torque below the rated speed is improved. The reason for difficulty of flux weakening for the traditional permanent magnet motor is analyized. The flux-weakening principle is formulated. The torque and flux-weakening charactersitics are anlylized.

For different ratio mass of powder and several thicknesses of membranes, a tensile test is achieved in order to evaluate the parameters of each model. This step allows fitting models curves with measurement curve and evaluate the relative error between each model and measurement. Thus, the best model can be determinate. An implementation of these parameters into FEM software allows computing the displacement of the membrane in function of the applied pressure. A simple setup constituted of the air chamber, the laser and the membrane support leads to a measure of the membrane displacement in the real case.

An enlarged air gap is highly problematic for the torque density of both motor types, which leads to the use of resource critical rare earth permanent magnet motors in many applications.

The purpose of FOC is to guarantee perfect dynamic and steady performance of induction motors, but there is cross-coupling between dq current components, which impairs the characteristics of response. Therefore, a decoupled current control strategy using internal model based on active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is proposed. The internal model control (IMC) is used to control an ideal motor decoupled model, which is directly related to the system dynamic response performance. The ADRC is used to estimate and compensate the disturbances so that it reduces the reliance of IMC on the time constant of filter when the model mismatches. The proposed method has great contribution to the robustness of parameter uncertainties and disturbances. The experimental results indicate that the robustness of the proposed optimal design method for IMC is better than the conventional IMC when the disturbances occur and the model mismatches, and the method is feasible and effective.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837352","Internal Model Control;Active Disturbance Rejection Control;Induction Motor;Robust","Mathematical model;Induction motors;Low-pass filters;Robustness;Robust control;Load modeling;Control systems","active disturbance rejection control;compensation;electric current control;induction motor drives;machine vector control","decoupled current control strategy;induction motors drives;internal model;active disturbance rejection control strategy;field-oriented control;FOC;IMC;ADRC;ideal motor decoupled model;disturbance compensation;disturbance estimation;optimal design method","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this gives rise to major issues such as complicated control system and associated electronics, resulting in enlarged equipment size. The proposed magnetic levitated motor uses a radial self-bearing motor to control both radial translation motion and rotation, and an axial magnetic bearing to control both axial translation and tilt motion. Moreover, stators were installed on the inner side of the rotor, such that the flux path of the axial magnetic bearing and radial self-bearing motor are partially-shared. Therefore, the proposed magnetic levitated motor is small, while achieving five degrees of freedom active control. The prototype device was designed using FEM.

Single-phase induction motors (SPIM) are the most common type of motor used in PV pumping application. Reliable operation, low cost and low maintenance are the main advantages of SPIM. However, SPIM have an inherent problem of low efficiency at low speeds, which can be overcome by the adoption of two-phase induction motors (TPIM). This paper proposes a new speed control method for the TPIM used in PV water pumping system. The TPIM is supplied with unbalanced two-phase voltages generated by the inverter that employs the carrier-based SVPWM switching strategy. The V/F control is incorporated to realize variable speed operation. The motor reference speed is set to be proportional to the power generated by the PV array. As a result, the motor speed always tracks power fluctuation of the PV array, leading to improved system efficiency.

Usually the motor is piloted by a vector control associated with a flux-weakening algorithm which regulates the voltage norm. If the critical point is located within the current limit then it is discerning at very high speed to drive the motor with a Maximum Torque Per Volt (MTPV) strategy. In this article we propose to achieve a unified control algorithm to drive the motor theoretically whatever its speed by giving a torque closest to its desired value while respecting the current and voltage limits and minimizing the current used. Consequently, at high speed at full flux-weakening MTPV strategy is applied which comes to modify the saturation of the current reference magnitude given by the torque reference associated with flux weakening strategy. It enables us to have no switch of algorithms, nor Look-Up-Tables (LUT) which are realized by experiments and depend on the motor, and to not introduce additional observers or regulators, while being precise and more robust to parameter variation than a direct calculation algorithm. The performance of this method is analyzed through a simulation.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837384","Flux Weakening;MTPV;Vector Control;High Speed PMSM","Torque;Voltage control;Traction motors;Permanent magnet motors;Trajectory;Synchronous motors;Table lookup","electric current control;machine vector control;permanent magnet motors;synchronous motors;voltage control","high speed PMSM flux-weakening strategy;high speed permanent magnet synchronous motors;vector control;maximum torque per volt;MTPV","","","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although simulators are commonly employed for predicting the AC current distribution, simple analytical methods are also required for effective design or invention of the inductor structure with less copper loss. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel analysis method of the AC current distribution in parallel-connected wires of high frequency inductors.

The proposed inverter employs a charge-pump (CP) circuit instead of the commonly used step-up converter of a chopper type. Because the CP circuit does not include any inductor, the proposed inverter can be formed compactly. The CP circuit steps up the dc link voltage of the inverter by superimposing the voltage of the capacitor in the CP circuit on the PV voltage. So that the inverter performs the effective operation of the voltage step-up, the capacitor needs to maintain an appropriate voltage level. The equations modeling the energy variation of the capacitor are derived. Based on the equations, the maximum voltage step-up ratio of the inverter is obtained. The observation of the simulated output voltage waveforms of the inverter introduces two improved topologies of the CP circuit. The experiments using the inverter operated by the described control techniques confirms that the inverter can perform effective step-up operation while executing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operation successfully.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837258","Charge-pump;maximum power point tracking (MPPT);photovoltaic (PV) inverter;pulse width modulation (PWM);voltage step-up","Inverters;Capacitors;Topology;Mathematical model;Pulse width modulation;Inductors;Switches","charge pump circuits;invertors;maximum power point trackers;network topology;photovoltaic power systems","PV inverter charge-pump circuit topology;photovoltaic inverter;chopper-type step-up converter;step-up operation;maximum power point tracking operation;MPPT operation","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to take the skewing into consideration in FEM simulations, one should design a multi-slice 2D model or a 3D model, since the skewing affects the motor design along the shaft axis. As a consequence, the complexity of the FE model increases as well as the computational time, especially when the analysis performed, takes into consideration the non-linearity of the iron core. This paper offers a technique for the skewing consideration in the induction motor, when simulated as un-skewed in transient electromagnetic 2D FEM analysis. The proposed technique could be particularly useful for faster simulations when the necessary simulation time is long, e.g. for diagnostic purposes. Experimental testing verifies the simulations' results with accuracy.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837406","Finite Element Method;Induction Motor;Skewing;Transient Analysis","Rotors;Induction motors;Stators;Harmonic analysis;Finite element analysis;Electromagnetics;Magnetic fields","finite element analysis;induction motors;iron","2D FEM unskewed induction motor;time-dependant electromagnetic characteristics;skewing technique;noise minimization;FEM simulation;multislice 2D model;multislice 3D model;motor design;shaft axis;iron core nonlinearity;transient electromagnetic 2D FEM analysis;diagnostic purpose","","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If excited by a magnetic source, the nearby magnetic field induces the particles magnetization with the formation of chain-like structures aligned parallel to the field direction. This phenomenon is responsible of the rise of a magnetic field dependent yield stress required to counteract the interactions between adjacent particles and break the ferromagnetic clusters. Thus, in the case of an external effort applied to the fluid, chain-like structures are stretched and the increased distance among adjacent particles results in an augmentation in the reluctance of the gap in which the MR fluid flows. The consequent variation in the magnetic flux produced by an exciting magnetic source can be detected as an induced voltage appearing in the system. The presented work proposes and discusses experimental sessions intended to underline the possibility to employ the aforementioned phenomenon in order to detect pressure or flow variation in MR valves.","","978-4-88686-098-9978-1-4673-8863","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837484","","Valves;Magnetomechanical effects;Voltage measurement;Magnetic flux;Magnetic domains;Magnetic resonance imaging;Saturation magnetization","ferromagnetic materials;flow measurement;flow sensors;magnetic field measurement;magnetic fluids;magnetic flux;magnetic sensors;magnetisation;magnetorheology;pressure measurement;pressure sensors","flow rate variation detection;pressure detection;MR valve;magnetic flux analysis;magnetorheological fluid;MR fluid flow;suspension;ferromagnetic particle dispersion;particle magnetization;ferromagnetic cluster;chain-like structure","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
