Without brushes and slip rings, the system has significant potential advantages such as low maintenance and high heat dissipation capacity. As a key part of the MFM-BDRM system, an axial MFM-BDRM is investigated in this paper. As the axial MFM-BDRM realizes stable torque transmission based on the effective harmonic magnetic field, modulation effect of the machine is discussed. In order to determine the scheme, electromagnetic performance is evaluated with models of different combination between the pole-pair number of the stator and that of the permanent magnet rotor. After that, the preferred scheme is optimized to improve the torque transmission capability.

This paper proposes several feasible stator segmentations with uniform stator segments or nonuniform stator segments. Influence of the additional gaps on both the magnetic field symmetry and the cogging torque is investigated.

In this paper, the influence of magnetic bridge design on the mechanical stress and electromagnetic characteristics are investigated. During the investigation, the total width of bridges is constant, and with the variations of number, width, direction and position of bridges, the stress and electromagnetic characteristics are analyzed in details. By comprehensive simulations, the optimized design can have 5% stress less than conventional ones, and without the obviously negative effect on back-EMF and torque.

As a result, more electrical aircraft (MEA), on which engine driven electrical power replaces other primary powers, is being investigated. However, with the increasing demands of electrical power capacity on MEA, the engines have to be redesigned to supply enough power and space for bigger generators. In order to avoid this problem, fuel cell systems could partially/entirely replace the engine driven generators to supply electric power on board. Compared to the traditional electrical power system which is driven by main engines/auxiliary power unit (APU) on MEA, fuel cell based systems would be more efficient and more environmental friendly. Also, fuel cells could work continuously during the entire flight envelope. This paper introduces fuel cell system concepts on MEA.

Therefore, to keep the power balance of the system, each converter station automatically switch to different operating modes by monitoring the DC voltage variation during different working conditions. When a small wind power fluctuation occurs, a part of converter stations connected to the AC grid adjust the power to maintain the stability of system.

However, the spoke location of the PMs causes not only flux leakages outside the stator but also large flux leakage in the end region, i.e. end-effect, which could result in a large reduction in the electromagnetic performance. Therefore, the influence of the end-effect on the torque-speed characteristics of three conventional SFPM machines having different stator/rotor pole combinations, i.e. 12/10, 12/13 and 12/14 as well as three novel topologies with less PMs, i.e. multi-tooth, E-core and C-core are investigated and compared in this paper. In order to obtain the end-effect influence, 3D-finite element analyses (FEA) results are compared with their 2D-FEA counterparts and validated by experiments. It has been concluded that due to end flux leakage, lower torque capability in the constant torque region is observed in the six machines. However, at high current levels, improved flux weakening capability in the conventional machines can be exhibited, while the large inductance causes lower power capability in the multi-tooth, E-core and C-core machines.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7013925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013925","","Rotors;Stator windings;Torque;Inductance;Current measurement;Magnetic flux leakage","finite element analysis;machine windings;permanent magnet machines;torque","end-effect;torque-speed characteristics;switched flux permanent magnet machine topologies;armature windings;spoke location;flux leakages;3D-finite element analyses","","5","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After this study, the project characteristics such as voltage, current and power in the load, supply voltage, switching frequency, efficiency and Power Factor are defined, at the same time the choice of dedicated integrated circuit to control and correct the Power Factor to be used is done. Components of the power stage as well as the control loop parts are defined based on design features. The next step is the generation of the circuit schematic and the PCB layout for manufacturing the printed circuit board. Once the circuit is all done, students are ready to follow a procedure set to study characteristics and performance parameters of the rectifier. Measurements are first performed on the load side and then on the mains side, with and without correction of Power Factor and after that, the performance parameters in both situations are calculated. Tables of performance parameters due the variation of the supply voltage are generated, with and without correction of the Power Factor and the same curves are plotted for comparison, analysis, and discussion for the proposed project.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7014109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014109","Education in Electrical Engineering;Power Electronics Teaching;Power Factor Correction","Rectifiers;Reactive power;Power factor correction;Power supplies;Voltage control;Integrated circuits;Voltage measurement","electrical engineering education;power factor correction;printed circuit design;rectifiers","teaching activities;Laboratory of Power Electronics;undergraduate electrical engineering course;Faculty of Engineering Bauru;UNESP;bridge rectifier;power factor correction;project characteristics;control loop parts;design features;circuit schematic;PCB layout;printed circuit board;performance parameters;load side;supply voltage","","1","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, many control schemes against the issues have been developed. For evaluating the effectiveness of the scheme, control experiments generally need to be done under actual IP networks. However, in actual networks, it is difficult to experiment under various conditions. Hence, the evaluation should be done under networks emulated by emulators because they can make the various realistic conditions. Therefore, it is important to confirm the validity of emulator in the case of using in NCS. In this paper, we discuss the validity of a popular network emulator built-in Linux, called netem, in terms of NCS. As a result, it has been found by experiment that netem in a recent Linux kernel can work well as emulator in NCS.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7013852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013852","","Delays;Jitter;IP networks;Emulation;Kernel;Linux;DC motors","control engineering computing;electric motors;IP networks;Linux;machine control;networked control systems;power engineering computing","network emulation;IP network-based control system;small motor;NCS;netem;Linux kernel","","1","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, it is compared with prototype model using circular coil. Many motors have been designed by using circular conductor which has low slot fill factor in a slot. However, proposed winding method using squared conductor, which has large cross-sectional area, has several advantages to design motors. Especially, it is a very attractive way to achieve high power density and efficiency as motor of Electric Vehicle (EV). But skin effect influences copper loss and heat generation due to large cross-sectional area of a conductor, resulting that it becomes more difficult to calculate exact copper loss. Therefore, proposed method considering skin effect is a novel technique to design motors by reducing copper loss, which can be validated by Finite Element Analysis (FEA).","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7013514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013514","","Conductors;Copper;Skin effect;Prototypes;Thermal analysis;Analytical models","coils;conductors (electric);design engineering;finite element analysis;machine windings;permanent magnet motors;reluctance motors;skin effect;thermal analysis","copper loss analysis;thermal analysis;square conductor division;skin effect;permanent magnet assisted-synchronous reluctance motor design;PMa-synRM;circular conductor;slot fill factor;circular coil;winding method;electric vehicle;high power density;heat generation;exact copper loss calculation;copper loss reduction;finite element analysis;FEA","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cogging torque of the DRAFFSPM machine is high due to the flux focusing which is caused by the double salient structure. In order to reduce the cogging torque, the influence of the rotor pole width and shape on the cogging torque is analyzed based on the 3D finite element (FE) method. The cogging torque reduction methods, such as the rotor skewing, rotor notching, and rotor pole displacement, etc., are investigated. The results show that increasing the rotor pole width and adopting fan-shaped rotor pole can decrease the cogging torque greatly. The cogging torque can be reduced by ~77% when the rotor pole width and rotor fan-shaped angle are optimized to 15.5 deg. and 3 deg., respectively. The cogging torque can't be decreased by the rotor skewing for DRAFFSPM machine. However, the cogging torque can be reduced by rotor notching and rotor pole displacement.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7013746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013746","","Rotors;Forging;Torque;Shape;Stator windings;Permanent magnet motors","finite element analysis;permanent magnet machines;rotors;torque","rotor design techniques;cogging torque reduction;dual rotor axial field flux switching permanent magnet machine;DRAFFSPM machine;3D finite element method;rotor skewing;rotor notching;rotor pole displacement;fan shaped rotor pole","","3","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A shutdown of these motors should not happen due to its direct relationship to enormous loss to life and property, even if inter-turn fault of a winding occur. This paper proposed an inter-turn fault (ITF) tolerant control system using new-design brushless DC (BLDC) motor, which has teeth and yoke winding connected in parallel for fault tolerant control. The special point of new-design BLDC motor is that back electromotive force of teeth and yoke winding have nearly similar value and phase. In addition, we used a fault detection using input impedance algorithm. It can distinguish the ITF condition using variation of input impedance, which is obtained by monitoring of input voltage and current. After that, a fault tolerant control can prevent the spread of the fault by cutting off the three-phase winding and maintain partial output characteristics in proposed BLDC motor. The system has a special advantage that can use existing inverter without additional control device.

Moreover, the torque fluctuation caused by cogging torque not only affects the control accuracy but also generates noise and vibration. In order to improve the motor performance, it is necessary to optimize the structure of motor during motor design stage. To address these issues above, the rotor structure of IPMSM is optimized in this paper. Specially, non-uniform air gap is adopted during rotor design in order to obtain the optimal eccentricity.

However, the control coupling between active power and reactive power seriously depresses the steady-state performance of the conventional three-level DPC. By modifying the switching table of three-level DPC, the effect of power control coupling can be restrained, and the steady-state performance can be improved to some extent. But at the same time, the modified switching table will distinctly increase the switching frequency of the inverter because of the enlarged optional vector range, which is unacceptable to high power applications. In this paper, based on the analysis of power control coupling, a decoupled three-level DPC based on improved sector selection algorithm is proposed in order to eliminate the control coupling without increasing the switching frequency. The proposed strategy still adopts the conventional three-level switching table. Therefore, extra switching actions and high switching frequency are avoided. Experimental results verify the superiority of the proposed strategy. Compared with the conventional three-level DPC and the three-level DPC based on modified switching table, the proposed strategy achieves better steady-state performance.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7013691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013691","","Vectors;Reactive power;Switches;Power control;Couplings;Inverters;Switching frequency","invertors;power grids;reactive power control","decoupled direct power control;improved sector selection algorithm;three-level grid-connected inverter;reactive power control coupling;active power control coupling;steady-state performance;three-level DPC;power control coupling effect;modified switching table;switching frequency;enlarged optional vector range;three-level switching table","","1","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software based scheme is preferable to solve such problem because it requires no more hardware and is easy to implement. This paper compares the performance of two software based schemes, namely the negative-sequence voltage injection and zero-sequence voltage injection methods, employed in balancing the DC-link voltage of the cascade converter. It is concluded that the negative-sequence voltage injection scheme can provide stronger ability to balance the DC-link voltage with negative-sequence current injection to the grid, while the zero-sequence voltage injection scheme can balance the DC-link voltage without zero-sequence current injection.

The proposed claw pole concept is equipped by PM excitations in both stator and rotor and a field one in the stator. A special attention is paid to the cancelation of the homopolar flux which represents a specific leakage one associated to the field excitation. To do so, the effects of two (complete and partial) Aluminium-made magnetic barriers, inserted in between the stator yoke and lamination along the active length, on the back-EMF production capability are investigated. It has been found that the partial magnetic barrier is a compromise regarding the homopolar flux cancelation and the 3D-flux enhancement.

But the calculation by FEM is time consuming, thus it is not suitable for fast calculation at the design stage. Based on MATLAB/Simulink, this paper establishes the analytical model to calculate the variation of magnets' average operating point during the starting process of LSPMSM, by combining dynamic mathematical model and magnetic circuit model of LSPMSM.

It plays an important role in machine design and control. The common method described in most of the textbooks is to calculate the torque in the machine variables and then transform them to the dq-frame, through complicated mathematical manipulations. This is a more mathematical approach rather than explaining the physics behind torque production, which even brings a lot of difficulties to specialist. This paper introduces a general and intuitive approach to obtain the dq-frame torque equation of various AC machines. In this method, torque equation can be obtained based on the intuitive physical understanding of the mechanism behind torque production. It is then approved to be applicable for general case, including rotor saliency and various types of magnetomotive force sources. As an application example, torque equations of permanent magnet machine, synchronous reluctance machine and induction machine are obtained, where torque production capability of each machine may be easily understood and a fair comparison of these machine types may then be carried out.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7014033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014033","","Torque;Rotors;Equations;Magnetic fields;Stator windings;Mathematical model","asynchronous machines;permanent magnet machines;reluctance machines;rotors","torque production capability;ac machines;general approach;electromagnetic torque analysis;electric machines;machine design;machine control;machine variables;mathematical manipulations;dq-frame torque equation;intuitive physical understanding;rotor saliency;magnetomotive force sources;permanent magnet machine;synchronous reluctance machine;induction machine","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, by analyzing the characteristics of the position noises, white noise of uniform distribution model and the triangle wave noise model are proposed. The two models can be used to evaluate the influence of position measurement noises on the observed speed. Among the speed observation methods, the methods based on model predicted error can be used to observe the speed faster, due to the use of some priori knowledge. But these methods cannot be suitable for the case when the accurate model parameters cannot be obtained. Though the IIR filter has better low-pass filtering characteristic, it does not have linear phase and the stability is also a potential problem. There are not such drawbacks mentioned above for the FIR filter.

Through setting up capacitor voltage limit interval, the H-bridge modules in the voltage interval keep the last switch in/out status. Thus switch times of switch devices is reduced in a period. The validity and feasibility of proposed control strategy is verified through simulation and experiment results.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7013712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013712","","Voltage control;Capacitors;Switches;Rectifiers;Semiconductor devices;Pulse width modulation","power capacitors;rectifying circuits;voltage control","improved capacitor voltage balance control;cascaded H-bridge rectifier;CHBR;high switch frequency;switch power loss;semiconductor devices;improved capacitor voltage control strategy;capacitor voltage limit interval;switch devices","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a new type of power transformer is proposed using magnetic resonance coupling and air-core techniques. Theoretical analysis is conducted based on π-shape model of iron-core high frequency and circuit theory of resonant coupling wireless power transfer.

However, influenced by the mechanical structure of the motor, there is a larger amount of ripple component and electromagnetic interference component in the three-phase current of the main generator. This leads to the difficulties in making real-time and accurate detection of the current of d and q axis and makes it impossible to satisfy the needs for rapid and accurate adjustment of flux linkage and torque. To solve this problem, this paper analyzes the performance of the α-β-γ filter in tracking the armature current of the main generator and proposes to apply the α-β-γ filtering process to the sampling current before decoupling the three-phase current of the main generator. The purpose is to optimize the output torque ripple and improve the load performance of the main generator.

A hybrid NdFeB and ferrite switched-flux permanent magnet machine is proposed. This machine offers significant flexibility to achieve a desired cost/performance trade-off due to the use of a hybrid of high performance NdFeB magnets and comparatively low cost ferrites. Two magnet configurations: (a) series-excited and (b) parallel-excited machine are investigated for their electromagnetic performance and demagnetization withstand capability. It is shown that although their electromagnetic performance is similar, the series magnet configuration has a much better demagnetization withstand capability. Finally, in comparison to the conventional switched-flux machine utilizing only NdFeB magnets, it is shown that the series-excited hybridmagnet machine can achieve the same torque with an 18.5% increase in axial length and a cost saving of 12% when the NdFeB/ferrite volume ratio is 1:1.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7014029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014029","low-cost machine;switched-flux machine;hybrid-magnet machine;synchronous permanent magnet machine","Torque;Ferrites;Magnetic flux;Switches;Rotors;Electromagnetics;Stators","demagnetisation;iron compounds;neodymium compounds;permanent magnet machines","performance analysis;switched-flux permanent magnet machines;ferrite magnets;hybrid magnets;performance trade-off;cost trade-off;series-excited machine;parallel-excited machine;electromagnetic performance;demagnetization withstand capability;NdFeB","","4","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The modulation signals are operated by without crossover to avoid the distortion of output voltages. The switching states can prevent the short through in the inverter leg. For the CF-mode, the modulation indices are identical and less than, or equal to 2/√3. Therefore, the sum of phase-shift angles is 0°. For the CF and VF modes, the displacement phase-shift angle is able to adjust from 0° to 360°, when the sum of modulation indices is less than, or equal to 2/√3. The proposed phase-shift SVPWM technique is verified by simulation results, showing good steady-state performance.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7014076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014076","","Inverters;Space vector pulse width modulation;Phase modulation;Frequency modulation;Switches;Harmonic analysis","PWM invertors","modulation indices;variable frequency;constant frequency;nine-switch inverter;SVPWM;phase-shift space vector pulse width modulation","","5","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, series-connected photovoltaic modules are divided into several groups, which become the multiple dc units of multi-level inverter. The benefit is that, the voltage of each DC unit in multi-level inverter can be adjusted independently, with no output AC voltage distortion caused by unbalanced dc unit voltage.

Due to its inherited doubly salient structure and special working principle, the DSPMSM suffers from severe torque and flux ripple. Although some conventional control algorithms have already found some applications to DSPMSM drive system, their drive performance are not excellent during the operation, e.g. slow dynamic response, large torque ripple especially in starting or low speed. This paper proposes an improved model based predictive torque control (MPTC) algorithm to reduce the torque and flux ripple of DSPMSM. First, it derives the mathematical model of DSPMSM and then obtains its mathematical equations of ABC and d-q coordinate systems. Second, it studies the model based predictive torque control strategy, including optimality and implementation principle. Third, it proposes an improved MPTC strategy with a modified modulation index to increase the drive performance of DSPMSM, such as dynamic response and stable smoothness of torque. Based on this strategy with the modified modulation index, the torque and flux ripple of DSPMSM are reduced obviously, along with controlling the inverter in real-time to minimize the converter switching frequency.

Thrust force characteristics measurement is quite important for obtaining precise model and precise motion of PSRMs. Since the indelible friction exists in PSRMs, accurate thrust force characteristics are difficult to measure. This paper presents a systematic indirect thrust force characteristics measurement of a PSRM using flux linkage characteristics. With a dc-excitation method, flux linkage of the PSRM is obtained in terms of the measured phase current and voltage, and thrust force is computed by the flux linkage. Comparative studies of finite element method (FEM), direct and indirect thrust force measurements are discussed. Thrust force of the PSRM is experimentally measured by direct and indirect measurements.

As a deadbeat scheme, the P-DPC is to eliminate the output voltage frequency fluctuation. The time delay problem of traditional direct power control can also be avoided. Based on the mathematical model of PMLG system, the P-DPC calculates the expected voltage vector according to the instantaneous power, back-EMF reference and feedback values of PMLG.

This paper discusses a grid-connected BDFRG and the effects of varying the machine dimensions on the performance. If the machine is too small then it may suffer from saturation problems leading to low efficiency and also the reluctance ratio in the rotor may be poor. This means that the BDFRG may not be suitable for generating systems under a certain power rating. A power generation estimation process (PEP) for the control and power windings of the BDFRG is introduced. The proposed PEP is capable of calculating and determining: (a) the grid voltage; (b) the alignment between the rotor position and current excitation and (c) the appropriate voltage phase difference between the control and grid windings.

Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) modeling for grid-connected is studied in this paper. The simulation model of fuel cell stacks with DC/DC and DC/AC converters is built in Matlab/Simulink. The P/Q Control strategy is adopted in the PEMFC generation system in grid-connected system. A equivalent voltage source circuit with a resistance and an inductance is built for the PEMFC generation system in grid-connected mode. This equivalent circuit is used to analyze the dynamic behaviors of the distribution system or the micro-grid with PEMFC power systems. In addition, an equivalent current source circuit with a resistance, a capacitance, and an inductance is built for the PEMFC generation system. The transfer function of power model can be gotten by the equivalent circuit. It can be used in the analysis and design of power follow-up control system for a distribution or micro-grid. Data fitting method is employed to identify the parameters of the equivalent circuit, and the parameters are tested by the simulation model in various disturbances. When the grid is stability, the output power is positive correlation to the output current. So the output power transfer function of the PEMFC in the P/Q model can be deduced according to the current source model.

Based on 2D finite element analysis (FEA), the performances, such as open-flux linkage, back-EMF, average thrust force, thrust ripple, etc. are compared in different values of flux gaps, as well as different slot/pole number combinations. Due to flux gaps, it is found the electromagnetic performances are worsened along with flux gap width increasing to modular PMLSMs having slot number lower than pole number, but some aspects of performances can be improved to those having slot number higher than pole number. Due to the end effect of linear format, the thrust ripple is not significantly improved. Finally, to show the difference of linear motor, the detail comparison is made between modular PMLSM and rotate PMSM.

The interactions between PLL and RSC control damage the stability of DC-link voltage in weak grid. Synchronizing and damping components defined by PLL are presented for stability analysis physically. Each control's contribution to synchronizing and damping components is analyzed for different grid strengths and PLL gains. It clearly illustrates how PLL and RSC control interact leading to system instability. Time domain simulation of a detailed model was carried out to verify the validity of the analysis above.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7013940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013940","DC-link voltage stability;DFIG;phase-locked loop (PLL);weak AC grid;wind turbines","Phase locked loops;Voltage control;Stability analysis;Power system stability;Damping;Oscillators;Mathematical model","asynchronous generators;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;phase locked loops;power generation control;reactive power control;time-domain analysis;wind turbines","DC-link voltage stability;phase-locked loop;DFIG-based wind turbine;weak AC system;electromagnetic time scale;doubly fed induction generator;PLL;reduced order model;stability analysis;eigenvalue analysis;active power control;APC;reactive power control;RPC;rotor side converter;RSC;dominant oscillation mode;damping components;synchronizing components;grid strengths;system instability;time domain simulation","","3","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So series connected dc-dc converters are getting more and more concerned recently. To obtain higher performance, series PV/DC modular integrated structure is becoming of higher interest. In series PV/DC modular integrated structure, the serial output current is forced to be equal, which will obviously decrease the system efficiency under some special imbalance cases. This paper proposes an optimization approach that utilizes a power diversion circuit to decouple the output current, which overcomes the mutual influence among the mismatch PV modules and the normal ones.

Dynamic performance improvement of generator DC-link voltage is important to the increasingly automotive sensitive devices. However, limited dynamic response of HESG is attributed to the traditional diode rectification with large time constant of field winding. In view of relatively low time constant of armature winding, it is possible to improve DC-link voltage dynamic performance by regulating armature winding current of HESG. A new controlled rectification method of HESG with DC-link ultracapacitor is proposed in the paper, and no additional cost is attached to HESG system.

In weak AC grid, the turbine's terminal voltage vector (both amplitude and phase angle) is significantly influenced by the vectors of the grid voltage and DFIG's internal potential that is contributed by both stator and grid-side converter (GSC). Currently, most developed DFIGs synchronize with grid by phase locked loop (PLL) which generates the phase angle by detecting terminal voltage. The complex dynamics of terminal voltage may deteriorate the performance of PLL and destabilize it under large-signal disturbance, which may lead to synchronizing instability of the DFIG system. In this paper, a DFIG-based wind turbine connected to infinite bus via high grid impedance is studied. The structure of PLL in weak AC grid is given and the equal-area method is adopted to investigate the large-signal stability of it conceptually.

Under this condition, for a stand-alone voltage-source inverter, appropriated inverter strategy would suppress negative-sequence voltage. However the DC-Bus ripple voltage could be observed. Thus even harmonic and odd harmonic voltages in DC-Bus and AC-Bus can be introduced, respectively, and the power qualify is deteriorated subsequently.

It is worth noting that there is no need to measure the grid frequency and obtain the frequency differential as the fairly common practice does. The control strategy is essentially realized by optimizing the response characteristic of the internal potential, which is actually the rotating space vector of the FCWT's output voltage produced by the grid-side converter. In order to obtain the expected response characteristic of the internal potential, control bandwidths of both PLL and DC-link voltage loop are optimized. It is exactly based on that the FCWT can fast response and participate in stabilizing the grid frequency firstly relying on the stored energy in DC-link capacitor when disturbance occurs in grid. In the meantime, the variation of DC-link voltage during the response process is used to fine-tune the speed reference value to obtain the large kinetic energy in the mechanical system.

The accuracy of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) initial angle detection is the decisive factor in successful starting. To deal with the problems of low accuracy and unreliability in the traditional detection method of voltage vector, it uses reverse direction inductance to add constraints when the second series of voltage vectors are applied. And the actuation duration of voltage vector is extended to make current amplitude large enough for detection after the second series of voltage vectors. By enhancing the effect of strengthening or weakening magnetic field and enlarging the difference between each vector current, it finally improves the reliability of initial angle detection. The experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the analysis. It shows that the detection method can not only assure that the rotor is stationary, but also improve reliability greatly and increase the accuracy from 7.5° to 1.8° for initial position detection.

However, the steady torque ripple is still relatively large because of the limited voltage vectors in two-level inverter. Recently the concept of duty cycle control was introduced in MPTC to achieve steady state performance improvement. However the low speed performance is still not satisfactory due to the separate processing of voltage vector selection and duty cycle. This paper proposes an improved MPTC by simultaneous optimization of voltage vector and duty cycle in the cost function. As a result, much better steady state performance in terms of torque ripple and current harmonics can be obtained compared to prior methods.

The present overview attempts, based on recent grid specifications, an evaluation of commercial and novel wind generator systems with less or no PMs: from classifications based in principle and on gear ratio, through topologies, modeling, design and performance issues, with results from literature and also from authors findings.

Based on the operating principle of NPC inverter, this strategy overcomes one of the main problems of this inverter, which is the DC-link capacitors voltage unbalancing problem that appears in the neutral point under some operating conditions. The algorithm is a hybrid pulse-width modulation strategy, which based on traditional space vector pulse-width modulation (SVPWM) and virtual SVPWM (VSVPWM). The criterion is made according to the change of reference voltage, which is transited between the traditional SVPWM and the VSVPWM method. A strategy for balancing the voltages on the dc-link capacitors is also proposed and designed, which is based on a neutral point voltage balancing factor. So that the output voltage waveform is improved not only, but also the distortion of capacitor voltages is decreased.

Therefore, the cost of the HDPMWGs is higher than that of their counterparts. Based on the analysis of MMF contents of integral-slot windings and fractional-slot windings, the paper proposes a material-saving technique for HDPMWGs. By employing concentrated integral-slot windings, increased number of turns per phase, and rotor pole shift or step skewing, the optimized design reduces the amount of electromagnetic material being used, especially the expensive PM materials, without significantly impacting the performance and manufacture procedure of HDPMWGs. The techniques presented in this paper servers as a useful guideline for material-saving optimization of HDPMWGs.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7013524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013524","","Windings;Harmonic analysis;Torque;Forging;Generators;Rotors;Optimization","AC generators;optimisation;permanent magnet generators;permanent magnets;wind power plants","material-saving optimization;high-power direct-driven permanent magnet wind generator;HDPMWG;permanent magnet material;PM material;integral-slot windings;fractional-slot windings;material-saving technique","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But the unbalance in the supported capacitors' voltage of back-to-back 3L-NPC converters, including the dynamics of the capacitors' voltage, will cause variations of the voltage vector and the dwell time distribution in the synthesizing algorithm. In this paper a novel space vector PWM (SVPWM) for back-to-back 3L-NPC converter when unbalanced neutral point potential occurring is proposed. An error factor based on the difference between the fluctuate voltage of upper and lower capacitors is extracted. Based on this error factor the duty-time of every active voltage vector is calculated. In order to validate the model and the control strategy proposed in this paper, a 2MW 3L-NPC converter used in wind energy has been simulated.","","978-1-4799-5162","10.1109/ICEMS.2014.7013611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013611","","Vectors;Capacitors;Fluctuations;Inverters;Rectifiers;Space vector pulse width modulation;Voltage fluctuations","PWM power convertors;wind power","space vector PWM;SVPWM;capacitor voltage;three-level neutral-point-clamped converters;3L-NPC back-to-back converter;high-power wind-energy applications;voltage vector;dwell time distribution;power 2 MW","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
