This way, the desired nominal operation without overheating of the winding is ensured based on empirical values. In dynamic applications on the other hand, where nominal power and above is only demanded seldom, this means an unnecessary thermal reserve. By including the overload capacity in the early design stage, this potential can be exploited and allows for the design of small and lightweight machines still able to fulfill the demanded loads. The overload capability is thereby defined by thermal boundary conditions. For optimal use of the thermal potential in the machine design, extensive knowledge of the thermal system and its influence on the overload capacity is mandatory. Against this background, this paper focuses on the investigation of the thermal overload capability of an interior permanent magnet synchronous machine, also with respect to the applied cooling method.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549004","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Cooling;Windings;Sensitivity;Thermal analysis;Thermal resistance;Stator windings","cooling;permanent magnet motors;synchronous machines","applied cooling method;interior permanent magnet synchronous machine;thermal overload capability;thermal system;machine design;thermal potential;thermal boundary conditions;demanded loads;lightweight machines;early design stage;overload capacity;unnecessary thermal reserve;nominal power;dynamic applications;empirical values;desired nominal operation;related quantity;winding;current density;electrical machines;permanent magnet synchronous machines;machine parameters","","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The demonstrated impedance characteristics will promote effective use of sensor-less vector control systems of an induction machine (IM) with high frequency voltage signal injections. The IM is driven with an ideal voltage source, and the impedances are evaluated in operation at no-load and various load conditions. The impedances for high frequency components are measured from the amplitude ratios of high frequency voltage to the current, and their high frequency components are extracted using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. As a result, the main flux saturation saliencies are obtained under the conditions of high frequency and high voltage levels, and the leakage flux saturation saliencies are obtained under the conditions of high frequency and low voltage levels.

In general, no additional speed sensor is arranged in the compressor. During the operation of the compressor, the speed of the motor can be estimated by designing an observer for the motor current, voltage and other signals. However, when the motor idles in inertia during shutdown, the current of the motor cannot be obtained by the observer. This article introduces a speed identification method based on phase-locked loop in the idle state of the motor, which can accurately obtain the rotational speed of the motor in the idle state, and provides a solid guarantee for the unbalance compensation of the magnetic bearing in the whole process.

Distributed energy sources, different loads, and energy storage systems are all interfaced with AC MGs through power electronic converters. These tightly regulated loads could be regarded as constant power loads (CPLs), usually inducing negative impedance instability problems. Unfortunately, most stability studies have been based on small signal linearization techniques. This paper investigates the large signal stability of AC MGs based on mixed potential theory, and considers the influences of the storage system and CPLs. Firstly, the AC MGs are converted to DC systems in dq rotating frame. Then the mixed potential models are constructed and analyzed, and large signal stability criteria are derived. The criteria give important constraints on control parameters of the storage system, and the characteristics of CPLs are also taken into account. Simulation results indicate the criteria could guarantee the whole AC system stable during large disturbances.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549445","AC MGs;constant power loads;the Storage System;mixed potential function","Stability criteria;Batteries;Mathematical model;Electric potential;Power system stability;Microgrids","distributed power generation;energy storage;linearisation techniques;power convertors;power system stability","control parameters;dq rotating frame;mixed potential theory;negative impedance instability problems;small signal linearization techniques;AC system;signal stability criteria;DC systems;stability studies;constant power loads;power electronic converters;energy storage systems;distributed energy sources;AC MGs;storage system;AC Microgrids;signal stability analysis;CPLs","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to quickly track the reference current and increase the power factor, in this paper dead-beat predictive current control (DBCC) is adopted, so the complicated current loop control is not required. However, due to the fluctuation of dc-link voltage and insufficient voltage margin, using conventional DBCC more harmonics exist on the grid-side current and dc-link voltage.

Based on the consideration of the equivalent series resistance of the coils, it can be found that the number of coil turns, the mean coil radius, and the load have the optimal values for the optimal transfer efficiency, while the shorter the transfer distance is, the higher the transfer efficiency is.

Concentrated windings are inserted in the slots of the stators. The design considerations on the feasible slot and pole combinations are discussed. The major performance such as output power and efficiency are predicted via finite element method. A prototype is built up and the design has been verified through experiments. The results indicate that a high operation frequency can improve the output power, and efficiency can be optimized by regulating the loads.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549056","free piston;flat-type linear electric machine;finite element method;experimental verification","Generators;Power generation;Air gaps;Windings;Pistons;Permanent magnets;Stators","finite element analysis;hybrid electric vehicles;linear machines;permanent magnet generators;pistons;stators;synchronous generators","flat-type stators;quasiHalbach permanent magnet arrays;flat-type mover;flat-type permanent magnet synchronous linear electric machine;hybrid electric vehicles;auxiliary power unit;free-piston linear generator system;permanent magnet linear electric machine","","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is an important direction for the large-scale development of PV generation in the world. Traditionally, PV power collection in PV plants is based on low voltage AC method which will cause high net losses. Meanwhile, PV plants accessing to the AC power grid are limited by the system capacitive reactance, harmonic resonance, reactive power transmission problem and other problems. PV plants through DC collection method has many advantages compared with AC collection and represents an important trend in the future. The efficiency of the full DC system is about 2 %,~3 % higher than the centralized AC system.

If diameter and stacking length are different from initial size condition, medical device production is impossible. If initial size condition is changed, all internal configuration of medical device changes. For this reason, BLDC motor used in medical device designing has to meet initial condition.

However, due to decrease in energy storing capability, DC-link voltage oscillation seems inevitable which challenges the control for rectifier and inverter. Extensive research has been done to regulate the oscillation in a standard six-switch three-phase inverter. However, effect of motor speed transients on DC-link voltage has not been considered in this standard inverter, where mostly the grid input current control and the motor control are not decoupled, making the control very complex. In this paper, an electrolytic capacitor-less control scheme for a low cost converter comprising of a half bridge controlled rectifier and a four-switch three-phase inverter (FSTPI) is proposed, which can regulate the DC-link voltage not only at constant speeds but also during speed transients. Absorbed power by small film capacitors is regulated by controlling stored energy in them, which aims to make DC-link voltage follow its reference value. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation results.

The hybrid energy storage system (HESS) plays an important role in suppressing power fluctuations and voltage instability. This paper proposes a control strategy for HESS consist of super capacitors and batteries, and the effects of CPLs are considered. A high-pass filter is utilized to distribute power for super capacitors and batteries, separately. During identifying power fluctuations procedure, the power frequency and the negative incremental impedance of CPLs are both considered. Based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T -S) fuzzy model, the large signal model of DC microgrid is established. Then the stability constraints are deduced by Lyapunov theorem, and are taken into HESS control strategies. The proposed control strategy could fully exploit the advantages of large power density of super capacitor and high energy density of battery, and simultaneously could stabilize the voltage.

This approach helps to utilize the motor space effectively, and make compact size and light weight. However, when the rotor and stator are offset from each other in axial direction, the axial attractive force (AAF) is generated, which is able to generate noise and vibration of the motor. To obtain the stability of the motor in this case, the bearing should be properly chosen. To avoid losing the space secured in the axial asymmetric position by a larger bearing than necessary, AAF were calculated and analyzed to select the proper bearing. Firstly, the AAF depending on the axial position of the rotor to the stator is investigated by three-dimensional finite element analysis (3-D FEA). The torque is also calculated under the same condition to verify that the system requirements are met. Then, the bearing type is selected to ensure that the allowable load of the bearing is higher than the value of both AAF and radial force of the motor. Based on the analysis results, the proper axial position of the rotor with respect to the stator is proposed. Finally, the experiment is conducted to validate the accuracy of the analysis result.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8548990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8548990","axial asymmetric;axial attractive force;bearing;permanent magnet synchronous machine","Rotors;Permanent magnet motors;Torque;Stators;Force;Brushless motors;Synchronous motors","finite element analysis;machine bearings;permanent magnet motors;rotors;stators;synchronous motors;vibrations","axial asymmetry position;axial asymmetric position;AAF;axial attractive force;axial direction;motor space;compact size;permanent magnet synchronous motor;stator;rotor","","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, a lot of research about SBW has proposed a system using disturbance torque observer to obtain steering torque or reaction torque with low costs. A resolution of a position sensor directly affects the disturbance estimation accuracy at this time, so a high resolution position sensor is required for the system. But it is inappropriate for SBW to adopt it because of increasing costs. In this paper, therefore, we aim to improve the estimation accuracy of disturbance torque observer with keeping low cost. For that purpose, we propose new method which can improve the position information accuracy by using instantaneous speed observer, and we compare the result between new method and conventional one.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549492","Steer-By-Wire system;Master Slave control;Instantaneous speed observer;Disturbance torque observer","Torque;Observers;Force;Wheels;Mathematical model;Vehicles","angular velocity control;control system synthesis;observers;power system control;road vehicles;steering systems;torque control","automated driving vehicles;torque estimation;instantaneous speed observer;disturbance torque observer;steering system;SBW;steer-by-wire system;speed compensation","","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A magnetic-gear design that solves the physical-contact problems of mechanical gears has drawn considerable research attention. A magnetic gear has no mechanical friction loss, creates very little noise or vibration, and does not require lubricants. We attempt to apply magnetic gears to wind-turbine systems, which experience a catastrophic economic loss when the mechanical gears break down.

The system is called BMS and it detects the battery condition and stops operation before the battery shows any heat or swelling.

In this regard, the hybrid MMC (HMMC) topology is a promising topology because of its inherent low capacitor voltage ripple, without adding additional common-mode voltage and circulating current.

The magnetic permeability of the oriented silicon steel, which is often used in transformers, is significantly higher than that of the traditional silicon steel, and can provide a higher magnetic flux density for the motor. Firstly, the influence of the saturation effect of the magnetic circuit on the inductance parameters is analyzed. Secondly, using the finite element software Ansoft, the inductance parameters of the traditional silicon steel and oriented silicon steel PMLSMs are calculated with different loads. Simulation results show that the inductance of the surface-mounted PMLSM is no longer a constant due to the influence of the armature reaction with load.

Unfortunately, the equalization currents are almost small and uncontrollable. Based on Buck-Boost equalization circuit, this paper introduces the proportional current control strategy for equalization circuits of series battery packs. The state of charge (SOC) of each battery is considered in the strategy. The differences between the practical SOC values and the average SOC value are used to calculate the reference equalization currents to charge or discharge batteries. The improved current control strategy determines the duty cycle of the switches, while the voltage control loop determines the equalization direction of series packs. The derived strategy could realize accuracy control of equalization currents, and simultaneously, could achieve rapid equalization process.

As a result, the difference between terminal voltage samples of floating phases during PWM on and free-wheeling period shows a regular change, which makes it possible to detect the rotor position. Based on the principle above, the initial rotor position detection is realized. A new sensorless commutation technique is proposed by comparing the terminal voltage sample difference with commutation thresholds. When the PWM duty cycle approaches 100%, a complementary rotor position detection method suitable for the extreme situation is applied. Thus, the rotor position can be detected in full-speed range. Experiment results verify that the saliency-based sensorless strategy is simple and effective.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549172","Brushless DC Motor;sensorless;saliency pole;commutation threshold","Rotors;Commutation;Pulse width modulation;Sensorless control;Threshold voltage;Inductance;Voltage measurement","brushless DC motors;position control;rotors;sensorless machine control","initial rotor position detection;sensorless commutation technique;complementary rotor position detection method;saliency-based sensorless strategy;full-speed range sensorless control scheme;saliency effects;saliency pole structured rotor;BLDCM;Brushless DC Motor","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although this loss is only a small portion in the overall power loss, it still may expose the magnets to high risk of overheating and demagnetization, especially for the inner-rotor motors with weak cooling condition and motors operated at high-speed region. This paper presents a novel control method, asymmetrical dual-pulse (ASDP) variable conduction period control method, for high-speed permanent magnet BLDC motors to reduce the rotor eddy current loss. Comparative studies of stator current waveforms, harmonic components, and rotor eddy current loss have been carried out between the ASDP method and several traditional control methods. The FEM simulation and THD analysis results confirm that the ASDP method can effectively eliminate the even harmonic and weaken the odd harmonic components in stator current, so that the rotor eddy current loss can be significantly reduced.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549418","high-speed;Brushless DC motor;rotor eddy current loss;variable conduction period control","Rotors;Harmonic analysis;Eddy currents;Pulse width modulation;Stator windings;Permanent magnet motors","brushless DC motors;eddy current losses;harmonic distortion;machine control;permanent magnet motors;rotors;stators","high-speed permanent magnet BLDC motors;ASDP method;stator current;rotor eddy current loss reduction;high-speed permanent magnet brushless DC motors;inner-rotor motors;high-speed region;asymmetrical dual-pulse variable conduction period control method;control method","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Comprehensive investigations on the correlation between the amount and function of the permanent magnets buried in the rotor have been carried out to reveal the intricate relationship of these machine types. Both circumferential and radial flux bridges are commonly employed to provide dependable rotor integrity in these machines. However, the flux bridge width has a tremendous bearing on both electromagnetic performance and mechanical ruggedness, especially for synchronous reluctance machine. In this paper, the active saturation method is hence applied in synchronous reluctance machine to strike the right balance between manufacturability and electromagnetic performance.

From this, the average torque production is found to be proportional to the fundamental self-inductance component, which is maximized via variance in rotor pole arc during optimization. Firstly, the analysis is performed under linear conditions, then taking into account saturation with the aid of the frozen permeability method. When the core is non-linear and both machines are operated under the same copper loss conditions with a fixed stator pole arc, the VFRM suffers from more saturation than the SRM. Consequently, the optimal rotor pole arc of VFRM for maximizing the fundamental inductance and average torque are always smaller than those of the SRM under all load conditions.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549088","switched reluctance machine;torque production;variable flux machine","Inductance;Rotors;Torque;Stators;Copper;Reluctance machines","finite element analysis;magnetic flux;magnetic permeability;optimisation;reluctance machines;rotors;stators;torque","analytical torque equations;average torque production;fixed stator pole arc;optimal rotor pole arc;design parameters;switched reluctance machine design;variable flux reluctance machine design;VFRMs;SRMs;fundamental self-inductance component;linear conditions;frozen permeability method;nonlinear core","","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences proposed to apply evaporative cooling technology to IGBT modules. Evaporative cooling technology can better solve the problem of heat dissipation of IGBT modules. In an evaporative cooling environment, changes in the operating environment of the IGBT module may affect parasitic parameters within the module. Parasitic parameters are one of the factors that affect the operating state of the IGBT module. The presence of parasitic inductance inside the module can cause the module to generate a large number of voltage spikes during the switching process. Overvoltage can increase the collector current of the module and increase the internal temperature, which may cause device failure. This paper first uses SolidWorks software to model the IGBT, and then extracts the internal parasitic inductance and parasitic resistance of the module through the finite element software ANSYS Q3D Extractor. By setting the background material, the parasitic parameters inside the module under air cooling and evaporative cooling conditions are obtained. The comparison data obtains the influence of the cooling method on the parasitic parameters of the IGBT module, which provides a basis for further application of the evaporative cooling technology to the IGBT module.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549310","evaporative cooling technology;IGBT module;parasitic parameters","Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Cooling;Inductance;Software;Solid modeling;Substrates;Finite element analysis","cooling;finite element analysis;insulated gate bipolar transistors;overvoltage;semiconductor device reliability","parasitic parameters;IGBT module research;evaporative cooling technology;finite element software ANSYS Q3D extractor;device failure","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An improvement of over -30 dB was found for an investigated machine when an optimal harmonic current of 7th order is applied with considering optimal phase angle.

Thus, various publications are available which address the IM's parameter identification as well as the flux- and speed-observer design. Classically, this is handled as a separated two-step procedure. However, measurement uncertainty negatively affects the IM identification result and, consequently, the uncertainty regarding the IM's parameter is then adversely affecting the observer design. In contrast to that, this contribution is proposing a conjoint observer design and machine identification process by one global optimization. As the observer tuning and machine identification have the same objective, i.e. being able to control a given drive with highest speed and torque accuracy, there is no compelling reason to separate them from each other. Hence, more degrees of freedom are given to the optimization process. Whereas an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is applied as a flux- and speed-observer, sensor noise is taken into account due its internal working principle. Experimental test bench evaluations prove the feasibility of the proposed method, however, the achievable estimation accuracy is worse compared to a similar approach using an extended Kalman filter instead of the UKF.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549514","induction motor;system identification;parameter estimation;Kalman filter;optimization;control","Observers;Kalman filters;Optimization;Covariance matrices;Torque;Stators;Induction machines","angular velocity control;asynchronous machines;Kalman filters;machine control;measurement uncertainty;nonlinear filters;observers;parameter estimation;torque control","induction machine control;machine identification;observer tuning;conjoint observer design;speed-sensorless drive;model-based control;unscented Kalman filter design;conjoint parameter identification;speed estimation accuracy;extended Kalman filter;optimization process","","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Providing the proper dc-link voltage to support the VSD's converter is crucial. Conventionally, dc-link voltage is supplied either by a two-level rectifier with series-connected Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) and front-end isolation transformer or by a 12-pulse uncontrolled rectifier with a complex phase shifting transformer. This work proposes a new approach using series-connected multi Half-Bridge (HB) modules to generate the required dc-link voltage. The proposed topology is able to perform the AC-DC power conversion by employing lower voltage rating switching devices.

Evaporative cooling stators can be considered as the damping method to the SRMs' vibration problem, as it reduces the radial electromagnetic forces in stators by immerging them into the evaporative cooling medium liquid. This paper makes some comparisons of mechanical vibration between an evaporative cooling SRM and a conventional SRM by a multi-physic field analysis. According to the specific switched reluctance motor structure, calculations of transient electromagnetic field coupling transient structure field by a finite element numerical simulation software are finished for conventional structure and evaporative cooling stator structure respectively. Calculation results of the vibration velocity of the two structures are obtained. The result comparisons show that the evaporative cooling medium hydraulic pressure can decrease the value of radial electromagnetic force in stators evidently.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549053","evaporative cooling;finite element method;switched reluctance motor;vibration","Three-dimensional displays;Machinery;Energy conversion","","","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is found that the turn-off slope of current profile, rather than the current harmonics, has the dominant influence on acoustic noise of SRMs. Hence, the current profile is then created in the time domain via a series of discrete points, allowing the turn-off slope to be controlled. Due to the slope at turn-off being a dominant feature in reducing acoustic noise and vibrations, the current profiling technique based on time domain is superior to that based on frequency domain.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549123","acoustic noise;current profile;switched reluctance machine;vibration","Force;Stators;Vibrations;Time-domain analysis;Acoustic noise;Harmonic analysis;Frequency-domain analysis","acoustic noise;finite element analysis;noise abatement;reluctance machines;time-frequency analysis;vibrations","frequency and time domain based current profiling techniques;SRM;finite element analysis;current harmonics;switched reluctance machine;acoustic noise reduction;vibrations","","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome the higher order nonlinearity and parameters variability of large passenger aircraft with electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA) anti-skid braking system, a dynamic surface control approach, which based on barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), is proposed to design a slip ratio tracking control with an upper constraint. The purpose of the proposed BLF is to prevent constraint violation to ensure stability. A whole state space model of EHA anti-skid braking system is developed and simplified reasonably to a strict feedback form, whose model uncertainties are considered as unknown external disturbances. A nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is utilized to compensate this external disturbance. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is noticed that the proposed control strategy can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin by appropriately adjusting the controller parameters. Moreover, it can guarantee the tracking error is with semiglobal, uniform, and ultimate bounded. By using the employed control algorithm, the proposed controller enhanced braking performance and safety, which ensures the closed-loop system operating in the stable region of the friction curve. The proposed method eliminated the explosion problem of terms existing in traditional back-stepping approach and was easier to be implemented. The performance and the effectiveness of the proposed controller have been verified by carrying out simulation and real-time Hardware-in-Loop experiment.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549515","Electro-Hydrostatic Actuator;Anti-skid Braking System;Dynamic Surface Control;Barrier Lyapunov Function;Nonlinear Disturbance Observer;Slip Ratio","Friction;Mathematical model;Aircraft;Actuators;Stability analysis;Lyapunov methods;Hydraulic systems","aerodynamics;aircraft control;brakes;braking;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;feedback;friction;hydrostatics;Lyapunov methods;nonlinear control systems;observers;stability;uncertain systems;vehicle dynamics","electro-hydrostatic actuator anti-skid braking system;aircraft anti-skid braking system;slip ratio tracking control;EHA anti-skid braking system;dynamic surface control;closed-loop system;barrier Lyapunov function;BLF;nonlinear disturbance observer;NDO;Lyapunov stability analysis","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, considering the lack of inertia of the power system, the system stability problem and power quality problems of DN s are more serious than ever before, a variable droop coefficient control based on multi-terminal SOP is proposed to enhance robust performance and stability of DNs. Because of the similarity between the rotor equation of synchronous motor and the dynamic equation of DC capacitance of SOP, the frequency of AC system is coupled with the DC voltage of SOP via a variable droop coefficient. The key to adjust the droop coefficient is to adjust the virtual inertia according to the AC system frequency deviation. Thus the variable droop coefficient control of SOP realizes adaptive virtual inertia, allowing the SOP provide optimal inertia support to DNs. Then a four-terminal SOP system model is built based on PSCAD/EMTDC, and the simulation results prove the validity and correctness of the control strategy.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549489","Soft open point;variable droop coefficient control;virtual inertia;modular multilevel converter","Voltage control;Power system stability;Rotors;Power electronics;Power control;PI control;Electrical engineering","adaptive control;distribution networks;power electronics;power generation control;power supply quality;power system stability;robust control;rotors;voltage control","adaptive virtual inertia;DNs;four-terminal SOP system model;variable droop coefficient control;soft open point;power electronic devices;system stability problem;PSCAD/EMTDC;DC capacitance;dynamic equation;synchronous motor;rotor equation;power quality problems;distribution networks;AC system frequency deviation;multiterminal SOP","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The SVM must be achieved both to generate multilevel voltage waveforms to the motor and to control the capacitor voltage constantly at the same time by using redundant switching states of the system. In order to control the capacitor voltage, it is necessary to select the optimal switching state with SVM considering the instantaneous motor power factor. In addition, it is also necessary to eliminate error voltage vectors contained in outputted multilevel voltage waveform. The error voltage vectors are generated during the dead time when the switching devices in the same phase of both inverters are synchronously turned on or turned off.

Based on traditional phase-shifting converter, a new three-port impedance-type DC-DC converter is proposed by adding a quasi-Z-source (qZS) network. The battery connected in parallel with a capacitor of the qZS network works as the energy storage unit to deal with partial shading and power fluctuations of PV arrays. According to the characteristics of the new converter, a phase-shifting shoot-through modulation method is proposed. Meanwhile, a distributed voltage-sharing control is applied to the ISOS structure. Based on the modulation method mentioned above, the small signal model of the converter with one module is established using the state-space averaging method. Furthermore, the stability of the system with the control strategy proposed in this paper is analyzed.

To start with, the I/F control method is adopted to realize the startup successfully. And then in order to offer a smooth transition from I/F control method to Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) control mode, the given rotor current is reduced by SCRR, at the same time the synchronous rotating reference frame is close to the real rotor reference frame gradually. When the frames coincide with each other as far as possible, the two control methods complete the switching. In the braking state, the motor would be controlled by DSM, which switches the control method from the SMO to I/F method, to ensure the ride comfort of EV. Finally, the simulation not only verifies the feasibility of SCRR and DSM, but also compares the SCRR method with DSM to the traditional one-section current reduction rate method (OSCRR) without DSM. The results show that comparing with the traditional OSCRR, SCRR can accelerate the starting switching process of the motor and ensure a smooth and no-impact procedure.

The angle and speed estimation scheme of a typical sensorless control method includes two major part: the back-EMF observer and the angle-speed estimator. In this paper, the traditional observer based sensorless control method is introduced and analyzed. Then, an extended state observer (ESO) based back-EMF estimation solution is proposed, which reconstructs the position information by formulating the back-EMF information as states variable and estimating them online with the observer. Considering that the efficiency of suppressing estimation error is high dependent on the ESO's feedback mechanism, a linear-nonlinear switching strategy is proposed and analyzed to improve existing feedback function. The proposed method not only combines the linear ESO's good tolerance to the disturbance and the nonlinear ESO's high estimation accuracy, but also reduces the nonlinear ESO's sensitivity on parameters and makes it easier to use. As for angle and speed estimation, the traditional PLL method brings ripple and phase delay to the estimated speed. In this paper, an ESO based angle and speed observer is incorporated into the PLL to improve the speed estimation accuracy. Simulation result proves the advantage of the proposed method over the traditional observer-based sensorless control method.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549466","PMSM;Extended State Observer;back-EMF;sensorless control;Linear-nonlinear Switching","Observers;Phase locked loops;Sensorless control;Rotors;Regulators;Electromagnetics","feedback;linear systems;nonlinear control systems;observers;permanent magnet motors;sensorless machine control;synchronous motors","linear-nonlinear switching strategy;PMSM sensorless control field;speed estimation scheme;back-EMF observer;angle-speed estimator;back-EMF estimation solution;traditional PLL method;improved extended state observer;observer based sensorless control method;angle estimation scheme;ESO feedback mechanism;nonlinear ESO sensitivity;ESO based speed observer;ESO based angle observer","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key of DC-link current ripple mitigation is to design the pulse patterns of series current-source-rectifiers (CSRs) and series current-source-inverters (CSIs) collaboratively. Conventionally, the DC-link inductor is increased to reduce the current ripple. However, it will lead to bulky size, high cost, and slow dynamic response.

However, compared with the speed sensed drives, the performance of the sensorless drive suffers from a great variation at different speed ranges due to the extra dynamic of the speed observer in the whole closed-loop. In addition, the mutual inductance varies significantly with the motor speed and the temperature affects the primary resistance, which would result in the speed estimation error and instability problem. In this paper, a systematic design method for both the speed controller and speed observer is proposed based on the extended adaptive full-order observer (EAFO). In order to eliminate the impact of the end effects and temperature variation on the speed observation, the mutual inductance is corrected based on the estimated speed and a primary resistance identification method is employed. With the proposed sensorless control method, a two-degree-of-freedom control (2DOF) is realized and a desired control performance at the wide speed range is achieved, i.e. the high speed estimation accuracy, fast speed tracking performance and strong robustness to load resistance disturbance. Lastly, the effectiveness of the proposed sensorless control method is verified by simulation results.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549137","","Observers;Resistance;Inductance;Sensorless control;Mathematical model;Adaptive systems","angular velocity control;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;induction motor drives;linear induction motors;observers;permanent magnet motors;sensorless machine control;stability;velocity control","wide-speed-range controller design;sensorless linear induction motor drives;extended adaptive full-order observer;speed observer;speed controller;sensorless drive suffers;speed estimation error;speed observation;sensorless control method;EAFO","","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on excellent characteristics such as high efficiency, brushless DC motors are ideal for compressor drive motors. To solve the problem of poor reliability of Hall position sensor in high temperature environment, this paper studies the position sensorless control method of brushless DC motor for air conditioning compressor. Based on the basic principle of the back-EMF method, the terminal voltage measurement back-EMF zero-crossing rotor position detection method is adopted. By designing a reasonable low-pass filter, the high-frequency switching noise of the PWM chopping signal can be effectively filtered out. The least-squares method is used to construct a phase delay compensation function to compensate for the phase shift caused by the low-pass filtering and improve the motor operating efficiency. The motor control adopts a three-stage startup method, and the speed loop and the current loop adopt anti-saturation PID controller. Finally, an experimental platform is set up and the experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the control strategy.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549415","compressor;brushless DC motor;sensorless control;back electromotive force;phase shift compensation","Brushless DC motors;Low pass filters;Delays;Rotors;Air conditioning","aerospace components;air conditioning;angular velocity control;brushless DC motors;compensation;compressors;DC motor drives;electric current control;electric potential;least squares approximations;low-pass filters;position control;power filters;reliability;rotors;sensorless machine control;three-term control;voltage measurement","high temperature environment;position sensorless control method;brushless DC motor;back-EMF method;low-pass filter;high-frequency switching noise;least-squares method;motor operating efficiency;motor control;three-stage startup method;aircraft air conditioning compressor;compressor drive motors;Hall position sensor reliability;terminal voltage measurement back-EMF zero-crossing rotor position detection method;PWM chopping signal;phase delay compensation function;speed loop control;current loop control;anti-saturation PID controller","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although some traditional grid voltage synchronization methods have good harmonic rejection capability and high precision, the transition detection time of the traditional grid voltage synchronization is not satisfied when considering the common grid faults such as symmetrical and asymmetrical voltage dips. In order to achieve the fast detection for voltage dips, this paper proposes a novel grid voltage synchronization method.

The desired rotor voltage vector reference can be directly calculated based on the DFIG mathematical model in DBPC. And space vector modulation (SVM) is utilized to synthesis the rotor voltage reference. Satisfactory steady state performance and dynamic responses can be obtained using this method. However, in conventional DBPC, the information of rotor speed and position is obtained from speed transducer and position encoder, which increases the overall cost and reduces the robustness of system. This paper presents a position sensorless technique based on model reference adaptive system (MRAS) and integrates it with DBPC to achieve position sensorless operation. The proposed method is robust against the rotor speed variation, even when the rotor speed of DFIG changes from sub synchronous speed to super-synchronous speed. The effectiveness of the proposed DBPC with MRAS observer is confirmed by the presented simulation results from a 1500 W DFIG system.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549231","Deadbeat power control;sensorless;MRAS observer;DFIG","Rotors;Stators;Doubly fed induction generators;Observers;Reactive power;Power control;Mathematical model","asynchronous generators;dynamic response;model reference adaptive control systems;observers;position control;power control;power generation control;power grids;rotors;sensorless machine control;wind power plants","dynamic responses;conventional DBPC;speed transducer;position encoder;position sensorless technique;model reference adaptive system;position sensorless operation;rotor speed variation;sub synchronous speed;super-synchronous speed;MRAS observer;position sensorless deadbeat power control;accurate power control;quick power control;doubly-fed induction generator systems;DFIG mathematical model;space vector modulation;rotor voltage reference;steady state performance;DFIG system;rotor voltage vector reference;power 1500.0 W","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One very common reason for motor winding failures is due to the presence of partial discharges (PDs). This paper presents a test method to detect and evaluate the presence of PDs employing wave shapes similar or close to what is used in applications. The waveform is generated by applying a novel three-level inverter circuit. The set-up and detection method can for example be used to evaluate the influence of rise times, reflections and insulation conductivity on simple twisted pair test samples or complete windings. Initial measurement results from tests on twisted pair aimed to resemble a random wound motor are presented. In particular, the influence of conductivity, permittivity and rise time is explored by applying square shaped waveforms. The PDs appearing after the unipolar flanks are compared with full size bipolar voltage steps. When the zero voltage was reached the remining charges within and surrounding the defect produced a PD pattern (PD echo) resembling the charge amount within the winding. Tests showed a significant difference due to the choice of material. The introduced measurement approach maintains the advantages of using impulses to evaluate windings but complemented with charge decay measurement.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549140","Machine windings;Measurements;Partial discharges;Power Frequency;Pulse width modulation;Pulse generation;Twisted pair cables","Partial discharges;Windings;Voltage measurement;Insulation;Pulse width modulation;Shape;High-voltage techniques","gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;insulation testing;invertors;machine insulation;machine windings;partial discharges;power electronics;silicon compounds;wide band gap semiconductors","power electronic applications;motor winding failures;three-level inverter circuit;insulation conductivity;simple twisted pair test samples;random wound motor;permittivity;square shaped waveforms;charge decay measurement;winding insulation;discharge characteristics;semiconductor materials;partial discharge pattern;motor winding quality;bipolar voltage steps;partial discharge echo;SiC;GaN","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Weak grids usually present electrical characteristics like high harmonic content, high grid impedance and fluctuating voltage. When a grid-connected PV inverter is connected to weak grids, the traditional control method shows its limitation. In view of the nonlinearity of the mathematical model of the PV inverters, the algorithm derived from passive-based control (PBC) theory can be used to control the PV inverter, enabling the inverter to have better performance in weak grids. Firstly, this paper establishes the Euler-Lagrange (EL) mathematical model of the inverter based on energy method, and proves the passivity of the inverter system. Secondly, passivity-based control is applied to design the traditional passivity-based controller of the inverter system by injecting damping; then an improved passivity control method based on quasi-PR control method is proposed, namely, the error energy is first sent to the quasi- PR controller to change the damping coefficient of the system, then the coefficient is send to a conventional passivity-based controller to achieve the improved passivity-based control method. Finally, experimental comparison of the two methods show that the improved passivity-based control method is more suitable for weak grids with voltage instability and large impedance. The experimental results verify that the improved passivity-based control has strong robustness when the voltage fluctuates.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549169","weak grids;improved passivity-based control method;robustness","Inverters;Damping;Robustness;Impedance;Voltage control;Mathematical model;Harmonic analysis","control system synthesis;invertors;photovoltaic power systems;power generation control;power grids","quasiPR control method;weak grids;grid-connected PV inverter;power grid;high grid impedance;fluctuating voltage;traditional control method;passive-based control theory;inverter system;improved passivity control method;electrical characteristics;harmonic content;grid impedance;PBC theory;Euler-Lagrange mathematical model;EL mathematical model;energy method;traditional passivity-based controller design;error energy;voltage instability","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The rotor retaining sleeve can be of different materials and shapes as long as it can withstand the high centrifugal forces exerted on the magnets. On the other hand, it is practically very difficult to remove the heat from the rotor in these motors. As the inevitable rotor temperature rise results in severe performance deterioration and even irreversible demagnetization, the overall rotor loss, especially the eddy current loss, is of paramount importance for these high-speed permanent magnet brushless motors. In this paper, the influences of retaining sleeve configurations, including laminated sleeve, circumferentially grooved sleeve, copper shielded sleeve, and irregular-shaped laminated sleeve, on the rotor mechanical stress and eddy current loss in a proposed high-speed permanent magnet brushless motor have been comprehensively investigated. The conductivity of the retaining sleeve and the permanent magnet has a huge impact on the rotor eddy current loss and the loss versus equivalent conductivity curve approximates to a Gaussian distribution.

Based on the above concept, a fuzzy control scheme of virtual inertia for synchronverter is proposed. And the influence of inertia on the output characteristics of the synchronverter is analyzed. Then the fuzzy rules are determined according to the virtual angular speed deviation and its rate of change. So the virtual inertia can be selected according to the actual operating conditions.

A special DC/AC power supply which produces an AC high voltage level with the frequency of the 30-50 kHz is required to energize the piezoelectric senders. The transmitters must send data in a few milliseconds and stop working about a second to receive data. For this reason, the designed converter must have acceptable power density to energize the piezoelectric actuators during data sending. On the other hand, the small size of the power supplies is another prominent characteristic of a converter because the communication system engineers prefer to have a device that occupies minimum space. In this paper, a DC-DC boost converter increases the input DC voltage level up to 5 times. After that, a full-bridge converter (FBC) is used to step up the boost converter output and provide the required AC voltage for the piezoelectric transmitters. A robust controller is designed to control the power converter switches. With respect to the proposed controller operation and construction, the converter can successfully drive the piezoelectric in noisy and harsh environments.

Radial dynamic forces arise when the rotor is eccentrically located relative to the geometric center of the stator due to electromagnetic (EM) fields in the motor. A possibly deleterious effect of this may be unwanted vibrations. A second effect of the EM field is a negative stiffness which tends to pull the rotor away from the stator center. This stiffness can shift rotor natural frequencies, especially in systems that have relatively low bearing or shaft stiffness, i.e. in some magnetic bearing applications. Resonance may occur when a natural frequency is shifted into an excitation frequency, i.e. from imbalance or the dynamic forces resulting from the eccentric motor. Most prior studies modeled the eccentric force with a simplified analytical model neglecting iron saturation and accounting only for the fundamental component of the radial air gap flux density. An improved approach is presented here utilizing the finite element method (FEM) to perform dynamic, electromagnetic field analysis of PMSMs with rotor eccentricity. Both radial and tangential airgap flux densities and eccentric forces are considered. The example illustrates how a rotor resonance can occur due to its negative stiffness shifted natural frequency coinciding with a forcing frequency produced by the eccentrically operated PMSM.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549153","PMSM;eccentricity;FEM;vibration","Force;Rotors;Permanent magnet motors;Induction motors;Finite element analysis;Vibrations;Dynamics","air gaps;electromagnetic fields;finite element analysis;machine bearings;machine theory;magnetic bearings;permanent magnet motors;rotors;shafts;stators;synchronous motors;vibrations","negative stiffness;stator center;rotor natural frequencies;magnetic bearing applications;excitation frequency;eccentric motor;eccentric force;radial air gap flux density;dynamic field analysis;electromagnetic field analysis;rotor eccentricity;radial airgap flux densities;tangential airgap flux densities;rotor resonance;PM synchronous motor induced vibration;permanent magnet synchronous motors;radial dynamic forces;geometric center;electromagnetic fields;EM field;analytical model;PMSM;deleterious effect;natural frequency;iron saturation;finite element method","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

THD is an important index to evaluate the fidelity of the CDAs. The works on this issue have focused on low power CDAs. While for high frequency and high power application with Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs, some other issues become significant such as the delay, switching transition process and the voltage oscillations.

The power flows in the higher voltage lines and the lower voltage lines interact each other and possibly make the EMLN weak. Such problem is designated as the parallel flow problem. Generally, there are two extreme attitudes toward EMLNs: 1) rejecting the EMLN despite the resulting waste of resources; and 2) misusing the EMLN despite the latent danger. These misunderstandings arise from the deficiency of a persuasive argument on the parallel flow problem. For this reason, this paper establishes an analytical model for the EMLNs. Then the flow decomposition function and the parallel flow function are derived from the network equations. These functions formulate the parallel flow problem in four aspects: 1) extracting the parallel flow; 2) formulating the interaction between the power flows in the higher voltage lines and the lower voltage lines in the EMLN; 3) identifying the pivotal branches in the EMLN; and 4) visualizing the parallel flow distribution. Accordingly, whether an EMLN can maintain an appropriate operating condition is assessable, which can result in a reasonable attitude toward the EMLN.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549446","electromagnetic loop network;parallel flow problem;flow decomposition function;parallel flow function","Machinery;Energy conversion","load flow;power grids","voltage lines;power network;electromagnetic loop network;parallel flow distribution;higher voltage lines;parallel flow function;flow decomposition function;parallel flow problem;EMLN weak;lower voltage lines","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the authors propose a simplified strategy for the source-side reactive power control with the source-side harmonic currents compensations. The instantaneous power flowing into a STATCOM shows that using the CDCVC-based strategy achieves sinusoidal source-currents with controlled source-side reactive power compensating the harmonic currents on the source side. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that sinusoidal source-currents are obtained with the CDCVC-based strategy controlling the reactive power on the source side.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549401","neutral-point-clamped inverter;static synchronous compensator;constant dc-capacitor voltage control;reactive power control;harmonics compensation","Automatic voltage control;Reactive power control;Harmonic analysis;Inverters;Reactive power;Power system harmonics;IP networks","compensation;invertors;power grids;reactive power control;static VAr compensators;voltage control","de-capacitor voltage-control-based reactive power control strategy;static synchronous compensator;three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter;harmonic currents;CDCVC-based reactive power control strategy;grid-connected inverters;fundamental active components;reactive components;harmonic components;instantaneous power;CDCVC-based strategy;sinusoidal source-currents;controlled source-side;constant DC-capacitor voltage-control-based reactive power control strategy;Three-level NPC inverter-based STATCOM","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, various parameters such as the dimensions of the beam, shape geometry are studied to determine their effects on the deformation and buckling of the beam under a thermal load. The pre-sizing of the dimensions of the blade shows that the thickness and length of the blade have a minor effect on the maximum displacement of around 0.4 mm. By adapting the geometry to have variable thickness, the behaviour of the buckled beam was completely changed and was shown to be able to transition to another stable mode. The use of geometry optimization allows the division of the beam into segments that can be specifically actuated to improve self-switching. The central vertex of the beam was also able to be displaced by 2 mm. This SMA buckled beam system shows promise for use in compact micro-actuator systems.","","978-89-86510-20-1978-1-5386-6149","10.23919/ICEMS.2018.8549122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549122","Shape Memory Alloy;Buckled Beam;NiTiNOL;Finite Element Modelling;Self-switching;Gripper","Strain;Blades;Finite element analysis;Shape;Stress;Actuators;Shape memory alloys","beams (structures);buckling;deformation;finite element analysis;microactuators;shape memory effects","deformation;geometry optimization;SMA buckled beam system;compact microactuator systems;actuation displacement analysis;self-switching shape memory alloy buckled beam;self-activating bistable buckled beam actuator;shape geometry;finite element modelling","","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, this paper is devoted to the experimental validation and characterisation of an EDTSB motor. Measurements performed on the prototype endorse the assumptions regarding the linearisation of the flux linkages as well as the negligible impact of the magnetic field harmonic content.

By choosing suitable controller parameters, equivalent output impedance of the inverter presents inductive in fundamental frequency. The other scheme is an improved virtual impedance method (VIM) based on reference reactive power correction.

However, these topologies must meet several requirements from output current ripple reduction and availability in case of electrical failures point of view. Hence, an interleaved DC/DC buck converter has been chosen as a viable solution in order to meet these requirements. With the aim of improving the availability and reliability of the DC/DC converter, the development of a power switch fault detection method is mandatory.

A split-winding method is used to redesign the suitable inductance to obtain the high performance of charger. Compared with conventional asymmetric converter, two relays and two thyristors are added in the proposed circuit. This topology can be rebuilt as a bridgeless buck-boost battery charger to satisfy the battery charzing requirement.
