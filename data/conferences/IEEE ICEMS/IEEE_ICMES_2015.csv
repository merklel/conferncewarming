It is shown that lamination asymmetries, and in particular the number of periodic non-circularities, can significantly increase noise and vibrations levels due to Maxwell forces. The number of segments, weldings or stiffeners should be multiple of the number of pole pairs to minimize the appearance of additional resonances due to new force wavenumbers. Some conclusions can apply to other magnetic asymmetries involved in modular stators and uneven magnetization PM rotor.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385319","","Stators;Lamination;Magnetoacoustic effects;Acoustic noise;Europe;Magnetic resonance;Decision support systems","acoustic noise;laminations;machine theory;permanent magnet machines;rotors;stators;synchronous machines;vibrations","stator lamination asymmetry effect;magnetic vibrations;acoustic noise;rotor lamination asymmetry effect;electrical machines;permanent magnet synchronous machines;permeance-magnetomotive force model;vibroacoustic simulations;full electromagnetic simulations;periodic noncircularity;Maxwell forces;stiffeners;weldings;magnetization PM rotor;modular stators","","4","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the traditional HVDC transmission systems cause a large number of harmonics in the sending-end grid current and the receiving-end grid current.

The saturation, cross-saturation and position effects on both direct (d) and quadrature (q) axis flux linkages are considered. A Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to obtain an accurate representation for the dq-axis flux linkages relations. In order to reduce the calculation time of the finite element analysis, a look-up table (LUT) for the dq-axis flux linkages is generated based on the FEM to be used for simulating the SynRM characteristics. It is found that the magnetic saturation in the adopted motor results in an enlarged region of stable operation of the SynRM. The torque increases by about 200 % compared with the unsaturated case, which proves that it makes no sense to model this type of motor without saturation. The results show the importance of including the saturation factors on the performance of the SynRM and its stability limits. Hence, the magnetic saturation effect will not only affect the stability of the motor but also on the whole drive system.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385335","FEM;Magnetic Saturation;Stability Limits;Synchronous Reluctance Motor","Couplings;Finite element analysis;Reluctance motors;Magnetic flux;Saturation magnetization;Stators","finite element analysis;reluctance motors;table lookup;torque;transient analysis","transient analysis;synchronous reluctance motor;stability limit;magnetic saturation effect;SynRM;cross-saturation;direct-quadrature axis flux linkage;finite element method;FEM;dq-axis flux linkage;look-up table;LUT;torque","","4","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this reason, a Tram-Train has characteristics of a wide variable speed area, requiring a traction motor design that is appropriate for the purpose. Accordingly, in this paper, wide variable speed characteristics through field weakening current control and interior permanent-magnet synchronous motors (IPMSM) that is necessary for high speed are proposed. But since IPMSM is in the shape of a permanent magnet that is inserted within the interior of a rotor, scattering problems that are caused by a strong centrifugal force occur.

However, passengers sometimes injure with large deceleration generated by the emergency stop device. Therefore, there is still place for improvement in its dangerous deceleration properties in case of emergency stop. Hence, the authors propose a new emergency stop device system by making effective use of double-cage structure of usual elevators. The stop device system proposed in this paper is structurally able to not only weaken impact force in emergency stop but also improve ride-quality at normal operation. In this paper, the authors focus on the deceleration characteristics in case of emergency stop as the first step of our study and carry out various digital simulations to show the usefulness and effectiveness of our proposing system. Additionally we compare the deceleration characteristics of our system to the conventional mechanical emergency stop device, based on several safety criteria.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385089","Double-cage structure;Elevator Emergency Stop Device;Magneto Rheological Fluid;Nonlinear Control of Damper;International Safety Standards for elevator","Elevators;Magnetomechanical effects;Fluids;Shock absorbers;Safety;Magnetic devices;Economic indicators","lifts;safety devices","elevator double-cage structure;emergency stop system;elevator emergency stop device;elevator safety device;passenger protection;deceleration property;digital simulations","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, HSPMM is being more widely used in the industrial application and aerospace aspect recently. Inner rotor structure is generally adopted in traditional HSPMM, and in order to avoid enormous tensile stress of PM, special rotor protecting measure is often needed, which brings with huge PM volume, low air-gap flux density and serious eddy-current loss. While outer rotor HSPMM can avoid these problems. Based on a 3kW, 20000rpm outer rotor HSPMM, a electromagnetic scheme towards the machine is designed and analyzed in this paper, and finite element method (FEM) is used to verify the rationality of magnetic field distribution; aiming at the great loss destiny and difficulty of heat dissipation, a water-loops between claw poles cooling system is designed and a 3D finite element model is established.

Optimized fault-tolerant current mathematical model is proposed by considering more constraints. The new model focuses on improving rotation performance with taking the influence factors of levitation force into account. It is more suitable for actual operations as the levitation force changes in real time. As a result, the torque of fault phase is increased without affecting its suspension performance. The rotation stability of the rotor can be enhanced accordingly. The advanced mathematical model can achieve a better performance of both suspension and rotation.

Several methods are proposed to reduce the rotor loss by optimizing the structure of rotor. The air friction loss on the surface of rotor can be decreased rapidly when pressure in the sleeve is very small. So the rotor mostly works in a vacuum in high speed FESS. Due to the effect of time harmonics of stator current and space harmonics of air gap magnetic field, the loss in permanent magnets is considerable and leads to partial over-temperature. Thus the irreversible demagnetization of permanent magnets is occurred with poor cooling condition.

It is found that the main components of thrust ripple are 2nd, 4th and 6th harmonics and that the effectiveness of skewing on load is reduced compared with that of at open circuit due to magnetic saturation and electromagnetic thrust ripple.

In this paper, the current-fed two-inductor bi-directional DC/DC converter (CF-TIBDC) is proposed. The proposed converter overcomes drawbacks of the conventional CF-TIBC, which are only one way power flow and voltage spike when the switches are turned off. By using the resonant components, the voltage spike problem is solved, and all switches in the CF-TIBDC meet the zero voltage switching (ZVS) condition. Likewise, the zero current switching (ZCS) condition is achieved through the switches on the low voltage stage. A wide range of output voltages with soft-switching is achieved by frequency-duty control. As a result, the proposed converter can maintain high efficiency across the entire range. The principles of the operation characteristics are presented with theoretical analysis, and the proposed converter is verified through PSIM simulation and experiment with a 300W laboratory prototype.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385386","","Zero voltage switching;Zero current switching;Voltage control;Decision support systems;Logic gates;Industrial electronics;Bidirectional control","DC-DC power convertors;power inductors;zero current switching;zero voltage switching","current-fed two-inductor bi-directional DC/DC converter;current-fed two-inductor boost converter;photovoltaic;battery;energy storage system;electric vehicle;zero voltage switching;ZVS;zero current switching;ZCS;PSIM simulation;power 300 W","","2","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in SRMs driven by voltage single pulse drive, it is difficult to achieve the demanded performances such as torque and efficiency because the output current is not controlled. Especially, the output current is strongly decreased by the back electromotive force in the high speed condition and low voltage source for automotive auxiliary motors.

However, there are significant challenges in converting the power generated from the piezoelectric elements to usable form. This paper discusses the design and fabrication of off-line power supply based on a self-oscillating flyback converter. An energy management circuit was upgraded for employing in the low power generators as piezo buzzer. Since the cost per unit of the existent energy management circuit is more expensive. Therefore, this research is also to concentrate on the design of a low-cost energy management circuit that the cost is lowers than 1 USD. The primary feedback self-oscillating flyback converter was considered due to its simplicity and low component count.

The single phase BLDC motors generates the dead-point causing a starting failure. This problem is solved by using an asymmetric air-gap structure. However, the asymmetric air-gap structure increases the cogging torque causing a noise and vibration of BLDC motor. Therefore, the reduction of cogging torque is essential to improve the performance of BLDC motor. This study for reducing the cogging torque of BLDC motors applies to notch structure of stator because of ease of application and low cost. In this paper, Availability on reduction of cogging torque of the asymmetric notch is proved by using two-notches.

The proposed circuit system is advantageous compared to center tap systems typically used at present, as confirmed by analysis and verified through simulated analysis.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385082","","Inductors;Coils;RLC circuits;Copper;Mathematical model;Iron;Magnetic hysteresis","power inductors;rectification;resonant power convertors","LLC resonant converter efficiency characteristics;current doubler rectification circuit;coupled inductor","","1","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different from the conventional control law, arm inductor voltages are considered in the proposed method. It is proved that in terms of eliminating the circulating current, the effect of this control law is approximately equivalent to the conventional closed loop control with circulating current suppressing controller (CCSC). Based on this control law, the operation of MMC is further analyzed and the modulation index limitation is offered when the circulating current is eliminated. Furthermore, this paper deals with reducing the capacitor voltage ripple. After comparison, the paper gives an optimized form for single-phase MMC when only second-order circulating current is injected. The analysis can be extended to three-phase MMC.

The core losses are segregated into three parts: hysteresis loss, eddy current loss and extra loss. The estimation is based on the information of maximum flux density and fundamental frequency and thereby neglecting the effects of harmonics which results in low accuracy. In order to consider the loss caused by harmonics, a field reconstruction method (FRM) is proposed to reconstruct the field density in the laminations. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is applied to obtain the harmonic components of the flux density to calculate the core loss. To verify the validity of the proposed method, both FEA simulation and experiments based on a surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machine (SPMSM) are conducted to calculate and measure the core loss. The comparison of core loss results obtained with different methods shows that FRM is both effective and time saving in determining the core loss of a machine.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385238","surface mount permanent magnet synchronous machine;field reconstruction method;core loss;harmonics","Core loss;Decision support systems;Harmonic analysis;Estimation;Reconstruction algorithms;Lamination;Surface reconstruction","eddy current losses;fast Fourier transforms;permanent magnet machines;synchronous machines","core loss estimation;Steinmetz equation subject;hysteresis loss;eddy current loss;extra loss;maximum flux density;field reconstruction method;fast Fourier transformation;FFT;surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machine;SPMSM)","","4","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It adopts combination of the DC link measurement and the modified model reference adaptive scheme (MRAS) to estimate rotor speed and position. A 16-bit dsPIC33EP256MC506 DSC is used to implement the proposed estimation algorithm and the control loops which makes the hardware very simple and compatible. The stator currents and voltages required for the speed and position estimation are not measured directly but reconstructed using the DC link voltage and current. For this purpose, voltage and current sensors which are already available in the DC link for protection purpose are used. Thus no additional sensor is needed making the proposed scheme almost a sensorless drive. Unlike existing MRAS based speed estimators which make use of both d and q-axes currents, the proposed scheme has a simplified adaptive mechanism based on quadrature axis current only. This results in a significant cost diminution. The Lyapunov's criterion is employed to develop the stable adaptive mechanism. The effectiveness of proposed scheme is verified under several operating conditions using Matlab Simulink software. The simulation results confirm how quickly the estimated speed can follow the real speed in all modes of operation. To validate the simulation results an experimental setup is implemented in the laboratory using a 1HP SMPMSM and dsPICDEM MCHV-2 Development Board. The practical results are in close agreement with simulation results and prove the effectiveness of proposed scheme.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7384969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384969","SMPMSM drive;field oriented control;sensorless;MRAS;reconstruction;sensor count reduction;MATLAB/Simulink;MPLAB X IDE;dsPICDEM™ MCHV-2 Development Board","TV;Hardware;Voltage measurement;Sensors;Simulation;Decision support systems;Current measurement","angular velocity control;electric current control;finite element analysis;Lyapunov methods;model reference adaptive control systems;permanent magnet motors;position control;rotors;sensorless machine control;surface mount technology;synchronous motor drives","Matlab Simulink software;Lyapunov criterion;quadrature axis current;DC link current;DC link voltage;rotor position estimation;rotor speed estimation;model reference adaptive scheme;DC link measurement;speed sensorless control;dsPIC33EP256MC506 DSC;surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor drive;DC link quantities;modified MRAS;sensorless SMPMSM drive hardware implementation","","","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The hybrid extended Kalman filter is adopted to dynamically estimate the cell SOCs which serve as a balancing criterion. A current sensor is added to detect balancing current for the SOC estimation. Simulations are carried out to compare the proposed approach with terminal voltage approaches and show that the proposed approach has charged more capacity into the pack in charging process.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385136","Electric Vehicles;Battery Pack Equalizer;State of Charge;Charging","Decision support systems;Batteries;Yttrium;Integrated circuit modeling;Iron;Kalman filters;Estimation","electric current measurement;electric sensing devices;Kalman filters;lithium compounds;nonlinear filters;secondary cells","online approach;lithium iron phosphate battery pack balancing;electric vehicles;EVs;battery usable capacity;active balancing approach;battery state of charge;hybrid extended Kalman filter;current sensor;balancing current detection;cell SOC estimation;terminal voltage approach;LiFePO<sub>4</sub>","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the higher reliability is needed in order to minimize maintenance. Direct-drive PM (DDPM) generators are a good solution to this problem because they omit the gearbox. The large generator mass has been also a difficult problem limiting the practical use of DDPM generators, which makes them difficult to build, transport and install. In this paper, a rotor supporting a 7MW DDPM generators is optimized by a response surface model (RSM). The dimensions that greatly influence the stiffness are taken as optimized design variables. Minimizing the mass is taken as the optimized objective, and the stiffness demands are taken as constraint conditions. The simulations show that the required level of stiffness can be met while reducing the mass by 11000 kg (34%) and the optimization results show the validity of the optimization method for the lightweight design of structures.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385125","","Generators;Decision support systems;Rotors;Response surface methodology;Optimization;Sensitivity;Wind turbines","elasticity;induction motor drives;permanent magnet generators;power generation reliability;response surface methodology;rotors;wind turbines","large PM wind generator;rotor supporting structure lightweight design;response surface model;wind turbine;direct-drive PM generator;optimized design variables;power 7 MW","","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Height of teeth and housing made of bearing shields (flange-mounted motor) without outer cylindrical frame are responsible for loss of accuracy between calculated and measured values.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385362","","Decision support systems;Stators;Three-dimensional displays;Permanent magnet motors;Analytical models;Loss measurement;Flanges","finite element analysis;magnetic flux;permanent magnet motors;shells (structures);stators","stator natural frequency determination;specific small industrial radial flux permanent magnet motor;stator natural frequency analytical model;cylindrical shell;ring shell;finite element analysis;bearing shield housing;outer cylindrical frame;size 30 mm to 90 mm","","3","","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Slip torque investigation and magnetic redesign of motor integrated permanent magnet gear","T. V. Frandsen; P. O. Rasmussen","Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark; Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark","2015 18th International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems (ICEMS)","","2015","","","929","935","This paper presents an investigation of 20% difference between the measured and calculated slip torque of a Motor Integrated Permanent Magnet Gear (MIPMG) prototype. The High Speed (HS) side of the Magnetic Gear (MG) was fixed by loading the motor when conducting the slip torque measurement. Suspicion of the motor saturating before the MG reached peek torque and thus measuring the maximum torque of the motor instead, made the method questionable. The MIPMG has been modified to lock the HS side of the MG mechanically and new measurements have been conducted but with the same low slip torque as result. It was realized that some magnets most likely are partly demagnetized due to an inappropriate magnetic design which can explain the measured slip torque to be lower than the results from static 2 and 3D FEA. With the discovered demagnetization and several years of experience with the technology, the MIPMG is theoretical redesigned and semi optimized regarding the use of magnet material while maintaining a reasonable torque density and high efficiency.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385168","Slip torque;Rotational losses;Eddy current loss;Magnet Gear;Prototype;Demagnetization;FEA;Build factor","Torque;Rotors;Torque measurement;Gears;Saturation magnetization;Demagnetization;Permanent magnet motors","demagnetisation;finite element analysis;gears;magnetic materials;permanent magnet motors;torque measurement","motor integrated permanent magnet gear magnetic redesign;motor integrated permanent magnet gear slip torque measurement;MIPMG prototype;FEA;demagnetization;magnet material;torque density","","3","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve this problem, this paper presents an efficient MPPC (E-MPPC) for three-level AC/DC converters by eliminating the complicated power predictions. As a result, the execute time and computational burden are reduced significantly while the control performance is not affected. Furthermore, the suppression of neutral point potential fluctuation and avoidance of high voltage jumps are also taken into account. A comparative study of the proposed E-MPPC and prior C-MPPC are presented in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulation and experimental results.","","978-1-4799-8805-1978-1-4799-8804","10.1109/ICEMS.2015.7385392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385392","","AC-DC power converters;Cost function;Mathematical model;Voltage control;Power control;Topology;Predictive models","AC-DC power convertors;power control;predictive control;voltage control","three-level AC-DC converter;efficient model predictive power control;conventional model predictive power control;multilevel converters;efficient MPPC;complicated power prediction elimination;neutral point potential fluctuation suppression;high voltage jump avoidance","","2","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
