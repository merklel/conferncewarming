Compared with the radial flux machine, the axial flux machine can have higher torque density and efficiency due to its tight structure. However, most of the axial flux machines are designed with the surface mounted permanent magnets (PMs) rotor, where the reluctance torque ability is reduced. To improve the torque ability of the axial flux machine, a new axial flux interior permanent magnet machine (AFIPM) is proposed and analyzed in this paper. The rotor of the proposed AFIPM is manufactured by the rolling the electrical steels as a ring core, then the PMs are inserted in the holes of the rotor ring, the axial side of the rotor ring is designed with the several different steps to eliminate the harmonics of the back EMF as well. The static performance and electromagnetic parameters of the AFIPM is calculated and it shows that the reluctance torque ability of the AFIPM is very good, based on the 3D finite element method (FEM) and frozen magnetic permeability technology.","","978-1-5386-3246-8978-1-5386-3245-1978-1-5386-3247","10.1109/ICEMS.2017.8055984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8055984","Electrical machine;electric vehicle;axial flux machine (AFM);3-D finite element method (FEM)","Rotors;Torque;Inductance;Stator cores;Stator windings;Permanent magnets","electric vehicles;finite element analysis;permanent magnet machines;rotors;synchronous motors;torque","rotor;electric vehicle;axial flux interior permanent magnet machine;permanent magnets rotor;axial flux machine;radial flux machine;electrical machines;AFIPM","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper mainly presents numerical calculation and experimental measurement of core loss of PMSM at various frequencies among 50Hz, 100Hz, 200Hz and 400Hz. A novel design strategy of PMSM will be described. The motor designed by authors is mounted on the vehicle and has 12 poles and 48 slots. It gives a numerical algorithm for iron core loss. At first, the hysteric and eddy current loss of single electrical steel will be calculated, followed by measurement at different frequency among 20Hz up to 2500Hz. Then, the dynamic hysteresis loop and high-frequency harmonic losses will be accurately calculated with power loss and dimension of single sheet, which plays a key role in the total loss calculation, especially at high flux densities and high frequencies. The final section shows the experimental results of (1) power losses of single sheet of non-grain oriented electrical steel, and (2) high-frequency iron core losses at 50Hz, 100Hz, 200Hz and 400Hz, which verify numerical algorithm. It is clarified that the numerical model and experimental iron core losses in each experiment are showed to be in good agreement.

The copper losses are decomposed into DC loss, strand-level AC loss and bundle-level AC loss. It shows that the AC losses can significantly increase the winding temperature and influence the temperature distribution in the slot. The bundle-level loss becomes dominant at high speed but has a small influence on the location of the hot spot in the slot, while the strand-level loss could pull the hot spot to the slot opening. A 12-slot 10-pole FSCW permanent magnet machine was prototyped and measured to validate the effect of AC losses on the winding temperature rise. The obtained results could be helpful for designers to build a detailed lumped-parameter thermal model of the winding or for the manufactures where to insert a thermal sensor to capture the real hot spot in the slot.","","978-1-5386-3246-8978-1-5386-3245-1978-1-5386-3247","10.1109/ICEMS.2017.8056170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056170","AC losses;concentrated winding;finite element analysis (FEA);thermal analysis","Windings;Temperature distribution;Copper;Stator windings;Stator cores;Power capacitors","finite element analysis;machine windings;permanent magnet machines;synchronous machines;temperature distribution","AC losses;winding temperature rise;permanent magnet synchronous machines;steady-state temperature rise distribution;copper losses;DC loss","","2","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional work about this point cares only about the stability margin of dynamic mathematical model. However, in this paper, it is pointed out from the analysis results that the drive system may be out of control even though the system has enough stability margin. It is induced by abnormal saturation of PI current regulator in d-axis, and this phenomenon may be deteriorated by digital control delay. This paper makes detailed analysis about this uncontrollable phenomenon and deduces an essential stability operating condition which is relative to motor parameters and digital control delay.

Dual stator-winding induction generators (DWIG) utilized in VFAC systems have the feature of the high fundamental frequency. However, the switching frequency of high power devices does not exceed 5 kHz in general, which makes carrier ratio lower. Thus, how to ensure the quality of the output voltage under the low carrier ratio condition becomes the focus of the study. In this paper, a novel low carrier ratio control method is proposed to improve the quality of the output voltage. In this method, the selective harmonic elimination pulsewidth modulation (SHEPWM) is adopted and the carrier ratio changes depending on different fundamental frequency ranges. The switching losses are limited while the quality of the output voltage remains good.

To guarantee the system stability and simultaneously maintain the CPLs good performances, this paper utilizes an active stabilization control strategy for the battery converter paralleled with CPLs. Based on the mixed potential theory, the large signal models of the storage system and the CPLs are established. The control strategy considers the negative incremental impedance of the CPLs in the outer control loop, and consequently, the converter with the proposed strategy could actively and quickly compensate the CPLs during large disturbances.

Zero voltage vector decreases stator flux and torque very slowly, so it can be used to suppress torque ripple when the system is at steady-state. And when the system is at dynamic-state, non-zero voltage is used to get quicker response. As both 111 and 000 can be used to generate zero voltage vector, switching state selection strategy in order to minimize switching times is given when zero voltage vector is used. Thus, an optimal switching table using zero voltage vector is proposed. Simulation results show that PMSM DTC system can work properly under control of the proposed switching table. The time of system stator flux response using optimal switching table is reduced by 73% and the time of system torque response is reduced by 82% compared with switching table only using zero voltage vector to decrease stator flux and torque. The torque ripple of the system is reduced by nearly 51% and switching times are reduced by 41% compared with conventional switching table.","","978-1-5386-3246-8978-1-5386-3245-1978-1-5386-3247","10.1109/ICEMS.2017.8056409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056409","PMSM;DTC;Switching table;Zero voltage vector","Switches;Stators;Torque;Torque measurement;Voltage control;Steady-state","machine control;permanent magnet motors;stators;synchronous motors;torque control","optimal switching table;PMSM DTC system;zero voltage vector;nonzero voltage;switching times;stator flux;stator torque;torque ripple suppression;system torque response","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the torque ripple is one critical issue to restrict the further development for SRMs, which is mainly caused by the doubly salient motor structure and unbalanced electromagnetic torque production in the commutation region. In conventional TSF control methods, the incoming phase torque cannot achieve its torque reference perfectly and the outgoing phase torque cannot drop down to its reference quickly in the commutation region. Therefore, in this paper, a novel boost chopper converter is proposed to overcome the limitation of DC voltage and mitigate the torque ripple by accelerating the excitation and demagnetization processes in the commutation region.

However, cutting the SMC preform block can destroy the magnetic properties of the SMC material, making that the electrical machine made in the laboratory cannot have the same performance as that in the mass production. To minimize the gap between the laboratory prototype and the mass production, the SMC cores should be made by the die compaction.

The reason for this interest is the machine's ability to operate as a brushless variable speed motor or generator through the use of a partially-rated power electronic converter connected to its second stator winding. Interest has increased in the last 20 years because of greater penetration of wind turbines with Doubly-Fed induction Generators (DFIGs) where brush gear and slip-ring maintenance and reliability have been a major issue. The BDFM appears in two forms, the brushless doubly fed induction machine (BDFIM), with two stator windings and a third closed rotor winding or the brushless doubly fed reluctance machine (BDFRM), with two stator windings and a reluctance rotor with no winding. This paper sets out to provide a rotor-centric view of BDFM operation, which shows the basis of its rotating flux pattern, aligning it with the known Natural Speed, and clarifying the synchronous and induction modes of operation of the BDFIM and the synchronous BDFRM. Based on rotor-centric view of the BDFM, it is shown that the conventional design methods for the BDFM stator back iron can be modified, leading to a lighter and smaller machine.

Until now, many research works have examined discharge analyses, but the discharge mechanism has not yet been explained in detail numerically. In a positive discharge, the electric field intensity at the streamer head can be enhanced owing to the superposition of a Laplacian field and a field from the positive space charge density. With this increased electric field intensity and attraction force between the negative electrode and positive space charge density, the positive streamer can move straight from the positive tip electrode to the negative plane electrode. In a negative discharge, the polarity of the electrode is reversed, and the positive space charge covers the negative electrode. Excess negative ions move toward the positive electrode, and a Trichel pulse is formed in the discharge current. To analyze this space charge propagation, we employed charge continuity equations for carriers such as electrons and positive and negative ions. These equations include ionization, attachment, and recombination effects, and Poisson's equation for electric fields. A secondary emission effect is included as a boundary condition on the cathode surface. Tip-plane electrodes were implemented in 2D axial symmetric model with a gap radius of 1 mm.

Experimental results verify that this kind of pulse pattern could realize a similar characteristic with the selective harmonic elimination along with a dynamic regulation.","","978-1-5386-3246-8978-1-5386-3245-1978-1-5386-3247","10.1109/ICEMS.2017.8056041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056041","synchronous machine (EESM);low switching frequency;model predictive control;sliding discrete fourier transform (SDFT);selective harmonic elimination","Harmonic analysis;Switching frequency;Switches;Predictive models;Synchronous motors;Stator windings","discrete Fourier transforms;harmonic distortion;harmonics suppression;invertors;machine control;predictive control;stators;switching convertors;synchronous machines;variable structure systems","harmonic distortion;modulation delay;electrically excited synchronous machine;model predictive control;sliding discrete fourier;dynamical selective harmonic elimination;low switching frequency operation;high-power industrial machine drives;switch loss reduction;stator current;EESM;two-level inverter;sliding discrete Fourier transform;SDFT","","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method estimates and control the angular rotor velocity using optimal control theory. The optimal controller used in this paper is based on linear quadratic tracking and the states of the machine are estimated using an extended Kalman filter.

NSS illustrates the effect of charging and discharging of main energy storage elements. Its geometrical features help reveal the optimal transient process between different steady states.

The performance of the designed WRIM using the analytical model is shown to agree with the results from the finite element (FEM) simulations, thus verifying the correctness of the model. The analytical model is then further used to design different WRIMs with different dimensions and rotor slot numbers.

In some medium/high voltage high power applications, where SHEPWM is utilized to modulate the reference voltages, the drift problem and the low frequency fluctuation problem of the NPP become difficult. The duty cycle of phase voltage waveforms under SHEPWM can't be adjusted after the switching angles were calculated based on the optimal harmonic limits. For the severe low frequency fluctuation of the NPP, a suppression method is raised based on 3-order harmonic amendment in this paper. 3-order harmonic has no effect on the output performances under 3-phase 3-wire systems, but it can regulate the NPP. By analyzing the relationship between the NPP and 3-order harmonic, an optimal 3-order harmonic is determined. Using the optimal 3-order harmonic to calculate the switching angles for SHEPWM, the low frequency fluctuation of the NPP is suppressed obviously, which is important to improve the output performances and to reduce Dc-link capacitors. The simulation is done to verify the correctness and feasibility of proposed method.","","978-1-5386-3246-8978-1-5386-3245-1978-1-5386-3247","10.1109/ICEMS.2017.8056223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056223","Three-level converters;Low frequency fluctuation;Neutral point potential;SHEPWM;3-order harmonic","Harmonic analysis;Fluctuations;Switches;Mathematical model;Pulse width modulation;Frequency modulation;Capacitors","harmonics suppression;power control;power system harmonics;PWM invertors;PWM power convertors;switching convertors","suppression method;neutral point potential;3-level SHEPWM;drift problem;low frequency fluctuation problem;NPP;medium/high voltage high power applications;optimal harmonic limits;3-order harmonic amendment;3-phase 3-wire systems;optimal 3-order","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, based on increasing or decreasing effects of the applying voltage vector on the amplitude of stator flux and torque of SPMSM, the proper voltage vector selection area of the DTC for SPMSM is given. Then predictive control is used to determine the angle of applying voltage vector in voltage vector selection area. A cost function of stator flux and torque's errors is proposed to evaluate the performance of different angle of applying voltage vector whose amplitude is constant. The angle which results in the minimum cost function among different angles is selected as the angle of the applying voltage vector. As the applying voltage vector is selected from proper voltage vector selection area, it can always satisfy the control of stator flux and torque. Finally, space vector modulation (SVM) is used to generate the applying voltage vector. Simulation results show the DTC for SPMSM works properly under the proposed control strategy. Compared with conventional switching table, the proposed strategy can suppress torque ripple and reduce cost function and mean squared error of torque and stator flux.

In general, as the number of main winding turns is higher, the induced electromotive force is higher. As a result, as the input current is reduced, the copper loss of the stator windings (main and auxiliary windings) is lower. Therefore, the motor efficiency is higher and the start-up and synchronization capability is conversely lower.

The effects of the number of main winding turns on the efficiency and starting capability are clear experimentally by using two single-phase line-start permanent magnet motors with different one.

There are many DC/DC converter topologies, but none of them can realize high voltage and high capacity of DC/DC converter requirements for PV system connected to HVDC grid.

The BFBIC topology has a unique future: it allows the converter work at an extra switching state - the shoot-through state to pre-boost the voltage of the converter, and then the voltage is step up by the high frequency isolation transformer. Through controlling the shoot-through duty cycle, it can realize PV maximum power point tracking (MPPT).

Ferroresonance can be critical for wind turbines during switching or fault conditions. This results in effects such as harmonics, voltage dips and overvoltage in the system [1]. The ferroresonance current is able to damage the machine and the rotor side converter, and as a consequence, the system must be protected [2]. In this paper, first the existence of ferroresonance in wind farms has been assessed. Software modeling and a validation method has been proposed and the simulation results for different system arrangements have been presented. In general, engineers can often work around nonlinearities using a simplified linear approximation to calculate or predict performance within the &#x201C;normal&#x201D; range of operation. This is not possible in the case of ferroresonance since linearized calculations will not predict it [3][4]. Therefore PSCAD-EMTDC software is used in this study to analyse the behaviour of a wind farm with Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) [5][6].

Generally a DC-link voltage sensor is indispensable for PMSM drive fed by voltage source inverter (VSI) to implement MPCC. In response to DC-link voltage sensor fault, by combination of MRA and sliding-mode techniques, a novel sliding-mode MRA observer for estimating DC-link voltage is proposed to perform MPCC. Moreover, in view of the variation of system parameters and external disturbance, a new nonlinear exponential function-based sliding-mode (NEFSM) speed regulator is synthesized to enhance the system robustness. In order to reduce the drive current ripple and improve speed &amp; torque control performance, MPCC strategy is employed. The resultant NEFSM-based MPCC PMSM drive system with sliding-mode MRA Observer has excellent dynamical performance. In comparison with PI-based MPCC PMSM drive system with sliding-mode MRA observer, the proposed NEFSM-based one possesses better dynamical response and stronger robustness in the presence of variation of load torque.

The SG-VJFET is a very promising power device because of the superior static characteristics such as normally off, low on-resistance, and high breakdown voltage, furthermore, issueless in terms of gate oxide reliability and long-term threshold voltage stability. The screen grid inserted between the gate and drain electrodes reduced the feedback capacitance Crss and improved the turn-off switching speed remarkably. On the other hand, the turn-on switching speed is considerably slower than the turn-off switching speed due to the influence of the forward pn diode parasitic between the gate and source of the switch. This drawback is inherited from normally-off SiC-JFETs with a similar device structure between the gate and the source. In recent years, several gate drive circuits have been reported to overcome this drawback for the normally-off SiC-VJFET, but there are limitations such as the need for complex logic circuits, switching frequency and possible duty cycle, additional cooling, and complexity of selecting electronic components. In this paper, we propose a novel gate drive circuit that can fully exploit the performance of the SG-VJFET. The proposed circuit consists of two standard gate driver ICs, a capacitor, and diodes, which can achieve fast turn-on switching without excessive power loss and can use with any duty cycle and high frequency.","","978-1-5386-3246-8978-1-5386-3245-1978-1-5386-3247","10.1109/ICEMS.2017.8055997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8055997","gate drive;JFET switches;silicon carbide;power electronics","Logic gates;Integrated circuits;Capacitors;Switching circuits;Switches;Capacitance;Standards","capacitance;driver circuits;junction gate field effect transistors;power field effect transistors;silicon compounds;wide band gap semiconductors","turn-on switching speed;gate drive circuit;SG-VJFET;standard gate driver ICs;ultra-low feedback capacitance SiC-VJFET;silicon carbide vertical field effect transistor;screen grid VJFET;gate oxide reliability;long-term threshold voltage stability;feedback capacitance Crss;turn-off switching speed;normally-off SiC-JFETs;high speed turn-on switching;ultra-low feedback capacitance;SiC","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a mass production environment, manufacturing variation always cause low order cogging components like slot and/or pole orders on top of fundamental and sub-harmonics of fundamental. To cancel this low frequency cogging components effectively a higher skew angle would be necessary at the penalty of lower motor torque. But, there could be a compromise in selecting the skew angle that can moderately reduce these low orders along with a substantial reduction of fundamental and its sub-orders to achieve an optimum reduction of overall cogging torque. This study investigated mainly to find an optimum skew angle for a given motor topology and for a skew scheme selected by the manufacturer to attain such objectives. The research identified the sensitivity of motor torque with skew angle and various skew schemes like step skew, continuous skew etc. for six-different motor topologies. Also, it is shown the effect of axial length mismatch between stator and rotor.

In a former work, the authors showed, that the model is capable to re-enact the basic dynamics of a measured hysteresis after a parameter optimization process. One of the main issues of the parameter optimization process is the mechanical differential equation, which is used to rotate the dipoles. In some cases, it causes an apparently unstable and random trembling of the dipoles. Therefore, the resulting hysteresis curves seem to be covered by a strong distortion. However, while comparing different measured curves to different hysteresis curves that contain trembling dipoles, it turned out, that there is still information in the dynamic behaviour of the dipole collective. Therefore, the apparently unstable trembling behaviour and different approaches to filter the included information are examined here.","","978-1-5386-3246-8978-1-5386-3245-1978-1-5386-3247","10.1109/ICEMS.2017.8056195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056195","Dipole-Collective;Field Computation;Hysteresis Modell;Magnetic Materials","Magnetic hysteresis;Mathematical model;Optimization;Current measurement;Magnetic field measurement;Hysteresis;Distortion","differential equations;hysteresis;magnetic hysteresis;magnetic moments;nonlinear dynamical systems;optimisation","dynamic dipole collective behaviour;magnetic dipole;apparently unstable trembling behaviour;trembling dipoles;random trembling;mechanical differential equation;parameter optimization process;regular Cartesian grid;phenomenological model;dipole-based hysteresis model;unstable behaviour","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Four goals are considered in this paper including transient stability, voltage profile, SVC investment cost and power loss reduction. Along with the SVC allocation for improving the system transient stability, an additional controller is used and adjusted to improve the SVC performance. Also, an estimated annual load profile including three load levels is utilized to accurately find the optimal location and capacity of SVC. By considering three load levels, the cost of power losses in the power system is decreased significantly. The combination of the active power loss cost and SVC investment cost is considered as a single objective to obtain an accurate and practical solution, while the improvement of transient stability and voltage profile of the system are considered as two separate objectives. The problem is therefore formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is utilized to find the best solutions. The suggested technique is verified on a 10-generator 39-bus New England test system.

HFAC PDSs are gaining traction in critical applications within outer space, aerospace and ground transportation PDSs as well as in renewable energy systems due to their advantages of being light deadweight, high power density, smaller capacitors and low arc-flash fault risk etc. Due to prominent adverse factors such as high impedance due to skin effect etc., the grid parameters (frequency, voltage etc.) selected for HFAC PDSs vary depending on the PDS length and power rating. Many of the electrical appliances available today cannot be cross matched and used in PDSs with other parameters, therefore the use of power converters as interfacing devices has been recommended. Currently there are only a few types of HFAC converters available in the market; out of which a majority uses resonant filters for sinewave generation whereas the remainder generates non-sinusoidal waveforms requiring complex controllers for voltage and frequency regulation along the PDS. The proposed two-stage symmetrical topology converter with low-pass filters provide the operation flexibility within a band of voltages and frequencies. The stage-1 H-bridge is PWM switched to boost the DC link voltage, whereas the stage-2 H-bridge is SPWM switched followed by the lowpass filter to generate sinewave output. The two separate PWM controllers used are implemented on a single microcontroller board and swapped for bidirectional operation. Therefore, the new bi-directional converter could be used in multiple applications; thus, supports mass production leading to availability in abundance at low cost.","","978-1-5386-3246-8978-1-5386-3245-1978-1-5386-3247","10.1109/ICEMS.2017.8056490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056490","Bidirectional converter;High Frequency AC (HFAC);transportation power distribution systems;high speed switching","Switches;Load flow;Pulse width modulation;Frequency conversion;Microcontrollers;AC-AC converters;Bidirectional control","AC-AC power convertors;domestic appliances;frequency control;low-pass filters;microcontrollers;power distribution;PWM power convertors;switching convertors;voltage control","bi-directional AC-AC converter;renewable energy systems;light deadweight;high power density;smaller capacitors;low arc-flash fault risk;grid parameters;HFAC converters;sinewave generation;two-stage symmetrical topology converter;low-pass filters;DC link voltage;bi-directional converter;interfacing appliances;power distribution systems;electrical appliances;HFAC PDS;HFAC enabled power distribution systems;resonant filters;voltage regulation;frequency regulation;PWM switched stage-1 H-bridge;SPWM switched stage-2 H-bridge;single microcontroller board","","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The 2-D magnetization structure is combined by four &#x201C;C-type&#x201D; iron cores and four step shape excitation windings. Each winding is divided into three sections to extend the frequency range. Accurate simulation and comparison was made to verify that the new structure is more suitable for measurement.

The dc current offset is generated by injecting the toque signal into the torque control loop of the DTC system of the PMSM to calculate the stator resistance. The stator winding temperature is estimated by the relationship between the stator resistance and the stator winding temperature.

For instance, they offer substantial reduction in size, and thermally excellent high-power density, which reduces the running costs with good performance and reliability. Moreover, high efficiencies i.e. over 90%, light-weight, low operating temperature, high insulation, no brushes/slip rings and almost negligible cogging torque make HSBPMGs ideal for co-generation systems. However, because of the very high rotor speed and high stator frequency, the design of HSBPMG is quite different from designing a conventional generator with low speed and low frequency. As the speed increases, the losses and temperature go up, and thus careful attention is needed while selecting the design parameters and material for the machine. This paper is aimed to use the basic design process for HSBPMGs running at 60,000rpm, with 6.6kW capacity keeping the losses minimum by using an appropriate material and cooling method.

The finite element models of the cable are established for excavating the implicit relationships between the surface temperature easily measured and the core temperature. In the calculation models, some thermal parameters cannot be acquired from the production specifications. Consequently, parameter identification is employed to identify these parameters. By the improved models, the relationship curve of the core temperature and surface temperature is obtained for inverse calculation.

In order to keep the simulation accuracy, the main concern of researchers normally focuses on the minimum simulation step size of the simulator, while neglects the role of input-to-output delay of the simulator. Concentrating on the study of hysteresis current control of grid connected converter, this paper investigates the importance of the simulator delay. With theoretical analysis, simulation and experiments, it is found out that the delay of the simulator seriously affects the control performance: it can apparently increase the hysteresis current band, reduce the switching frequency, increase the current THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and therefore deteriorate the control. With the input-out-delay, even if the simulation step is kept small, the simulation results are neither accurate nor trustable. Upgrading the simulator hardware to reduce the delay might be feasible in future but definitely very costly. While upgrading hardware is not a final solution, as an alternative software solution, this paper proposes a novel time expansion method. The experimental results prove that the proposed time expansion method can effectively cope with simulator delay in the HIL study of hysteresis current control, making it possible to achieve satisfactory performance with an ordinary simulator.","","978-1-5386-3246-8978-1-5386-3245-1978-1-5386-3247","10.1109/ICEMS.2017.8055920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8055920","Hardware-In-the Loop simulation (HIL);delay;hysteresis current control;grid connected converter","Hysteresis;Delays;Current control;Propagation delay;Pulse width modulation;Computational modeling","control engineering computing;delays;electric current control;hardware-in-the loop simulation;harmonic distortion;power convertors;power engineering computing;power grids","time expansion method;simulator delay;hysteresis current control;power electronic system study;simulation accuracy;minimum simulation step size;input-to-output delay;hysteresis current band;input-out-delay;simulator hardware;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;HIL simulation;RT-LAB;RTDS;grid connected converter;switching frequency reduction;THD;total harmonic distortion","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These not only cause difficulty during assembly of PMs and rotors, but also influence integrity design of rotor for high-speed operation. In order to solve the problems above, two kinds of rotors with different installation methods of PMs are comparatively analyzed by finite element method.

During this process, impulses associated with the fault are weak, nonstationary or time-frequency varying, and contaminated by noises, which render the problem of extracting these impulses very difficult. This work investigates the effectiveness of common signal processing techniques on predicting incipient faults, e.g. Fast Fourier transform, Short-Time Fourier transform, Wavelet transform. It was found that an adaptive filter is required to enhance and reconstruct the signals during the degradation process, and a combination of adaptive filter and Morlet wavelet transform is necessary in order to effectively detect a localized defect on rolling element bearings during degradation. The proposed method was applied to analyze vibration signals collected from a run-to-failure test of drivetrain.

As the control system at the primary level, the droop controller plays a major role in secure operation of MGs in terms of stability concern. However, the lack of high band-width communication links, low X/R ratio of grid impedance and fast response power converters make the droop-based MGs exposed to instability.

To solve this problem, a scheme of reactive power optimization for low-voltage distribution network using improved particle swarm optimization has been proposed. Improved particle swarm optimization dynamically classifies the particles according to constraints that voltage of each node is qualified, the reactive power compensation capacity of each node does not exceed the preset value and the total reactive power of the system is compensated rationally by roulette. The voltage and reactive power optimization scheme proposed in this paper combines the decentralized parallel capacitor with the voltage regulation of the distribution transformer.

A new structure of the hybrid microgrid is suggested by connecting different AC, and DC sub-grids by an interlinking converter. This can be symbolized by a bi-directional converter that acts as a rectifier when power flows from the AC sub-grid to the DC subgrid. And operates as an inverter when power flows from the DC subgrid to the AC one.

The optimal vector is selected based on the principle of power error minimization. However, conventional MPDPC will produce high power ripples and large current distortion under unbalanced grid voltage condition. To achieve sinusoidal stator currents and/or constant powers, both positive and negative sequence extraction of stator voltage and/or currents are required to calculate the power or current compensation value. The calculation is really complicated. To cope with the problems above, this paper proposes an improved MPDPC using a new defined instantaneous reactive power. Furthermore, there will be two vectors (including one active-vector and one zero-vector) applied during the coming control period to achieve better steady-stage performance. In this way, the sinusoidal but unbalanced stator currents are obtained without complicated calculation of power or current compensation and positive/negative sequence extraction of stator voltage and/or currents.

A novel SRM converter topology which integrated driving mode and battery charger are proposed in EV application. Due to integrate the winding of motor, the boost inductance is limited by the phase winding of the motor, so the performance of the integrated battery charger is cut down. In the proposed integrated motor drive, a novel converter topology and split-winding method are used to reduce the inductance and resistor of boost inductance and obtain high performance. Compared with conventional asymmetric converter, a relay and two thyristors are added in the proposed circuit. This topology can be rebuilt as a bridgeless buck-boost battery charger to satisfy the battery charging requirement. The split-winding design of SRM is analyzed in magnetic field by finite element method.

Then a mathematical expression which includes voltage of the coil, neutral point voltage of the coil and coil current is derived. Based on the derived formula, a practical self-sensing algorithm adapting for three-level switching power amplifier (PA) is proposed. In three-level switching PA, voltage of the coil is non-ideal at high level or low level because of inductive load. If signals are sampled at these non-ideal times, the detection precision becomes worse. The problem is solved through sampling at zero level and singular point will not appear.

Then, the magnet model, based on the bidirectional coupling of the electromagnetic field and thermal field, was calculated when taking the above magnetic field as the Dirichlet boundary to understand how the travelling magnetic field affects the ac loss and resultant temperature with time at different working conditions. The study is aimed to provide a useful modeling technique to observe time evolution of the temperature inside the superconducting magnet in the presence of travelling magnetic field.","","978-1-5386-3246-8978-1-5386-3245-1978-1-5386-3247","10.1109/ICEMS.2017.8056157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056157","Finite element analysis;linear synchronous motor;multi-field coupling modeling;superconducting magnet;thermo-electromagnetic properties","Superconducting magnets;Synchronous motors;Magnetic fields;Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy;Magnetic domains;Electromagnetics","electromagnetic fields;finite element analysis;magnetic field effects;magnetic fields;segregation;superconducting magnets","thermo-electromagnetic properties;superconducting magnet;travelling magnetic field Simulation;two-stage segregated modeling;motor model;magnet model;magnetic field distribution;electromagnetic field;thermal field;numerical simulation;Dirichlet boundary","","2","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
