The results of simulation studies need to be supported by special tools or scripts to analyze or visualize them easily. Some additional difficulties arise at sharing the results, visually comparing simulation runs across different platforms and showcasing the findings of a research to a larger audience. As a solution, we have developed a 3D Web-based Visualization Tool for VANET Simulations (WGL-VANET), which takes advantage of HTML5 and WebGL technologies to create a crossplatform, easy-to-use and flexible visualization tool for VANET simulations. WGL-VANET reads simulation data from a JSON document and supports a variety of visual features, and displays the simulation run on a WebGL canvas inside a web-browser.","","978-1-4673-9114-6978-1-4673-9113","10.1109/ICVES.2015.7396894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396894","","Vehicular ad hoc networks;Computational modeling;Data visualization;Data models;Vehicles;Visualization;Safety","application program interfaces;data visualisation;digital simulation;hypermedia markup languages;Internet;mobility management (mobile radio);online front-ends;rendering (computer graphics);software packages;telecommunication computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","WGL-VANET;3D Web-based visualization tool;VANET simulation schemes;mobility simulation package;wireless network simulation package;custom scripts;HTML5 technology;WebGL technology;JSON document;Web-browser","","1","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, traffic accidents have decreased as the years pass, and the number of the dead and injuries have been reduced. However, autonomous driving is not only required to detect bicycles around vehicles, but also expected to understand the behaviors of bicycles. In addition, since the proportion of bicycle accident shows a high percentage in the total traffic accident, it has been predicted an increase of the accident of the bicycle in the future. Therefore we propose a multi-directional bicycle recognition system using the distance information obtained by the stereo camera. In the proposed system, we divide the moving direction of the bicycle into three directions. In addition, we propose a robust feature extraction method on rotation in order to cope with the bicycle between each direction.

Most studies regarding this type of robot focus on safety control or efficient path planning but fail to consider passenger comfort. This paper describes how factors leading to passenger discomfort can be avoided by sharing behavior information. This study evaluates the validity of information sharing by estimating a stress level measured using heart rate and skin conductance as physiological indices. To investigate the relationship between different discomforting events and passengers' physiology indices, an experiment is conducted in which each passenger's physiology indices are measured while the autonomous robotic wheelchair is moving. For long-lasting stress events, the significant difference (p <; 0:01) in heart rate is shown by behavior representing of a robotic wheelchair with these indices. For strongly discomforting events, the significant difference (p <; 0:01) in skin response is also shown.

To reduce the complexity of the fusion problem in the Vehicle entity, the output membership function is fixed to the two developed FISs and the rule table is tuned relatively to this assumption.

This work studies comfort factors of the passenger while riding the vehicle. We propose a method for velocity control of the robotic wheelchair based on the concept of “behavior dependent observability” to reduce stress from the collision prediction in blind regions. Behavior dependent observability (BDO) is defined as the visible collision area against dynamic obstacles which is free from collision.

In this scheme, each vehicle determine the PN code based on the location that is estimated by GPS. However, in actuality, this location information is not perfect and this error cause a degradation of communication performance. In order to solve this problem, the positioning system of DS/SS-IVC scheme is studied in this paper.

Crosswalks at intersections are the one of most hazardous where many accidents between turning-vehicles and pedestrians occur. In this paper, we present a method for estimating the pedestrian's intention to cross a signalized crosswalk or stop in front of it. The intention is crucial to not only the collision avoidance but also smooth traffic in the context of autonomous driving by reducing unnecessary risk margins. Regarding the behavioral flow of pedestrian: assessment, decision-making and physical movement, as a stochastic process, we construct a probabilistic model with the Dynamic Bayesian Network. It takes account of not only pedestrian physical states but also contextual information and integrates the relationship among them. By employing the particle filter as a Bayesian filtering framework, the model estimates the pedestrian state from signal information and pedestrian position measurements. Evaluation using experimental data collected in real traffic scene shows that the proposed model has an ability to detect the pedestrian intention to cross a crosswalk even when he/she is far from it.","","978-1-4673-9114-6978-1-4673-9113","10.1109/ICVES.2015.7396904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396904","","Vehicles;Bayes methods;Safety;Vehicle dynamics;Legged locomotion;Decision making;Position measurement","belief networks;driver information systems;intelligent transportation systems;particle filtering (numerical methods);pedestrians;probability;road accidents;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;stochastic processes","probability estimation;pedestrian crossing intention detection;signalized crosswalks;autonomous driving;ADAS;intersections;turning-vehicles accidents;pedestrian accidents;pedestrian intention estimation;collision avoidance;risk margins;pedestrian behavioral flow;decision-making;physical movement;stochastic process;probabilistic model;dynamic Bayesian network;pedestrian physical states;particle filter;Bayesian filtering framework;pedestrian state estimation;signal information;pedestrian position measurements;advanced driver assistance system","","5","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A quadratic cost function is developed that considers the contradictions between minimal tracking error and acceleration limits of the ACC vehicle. Hence, the characteristics of permissible following distance and acceleration command are expressed as linear constraints, simultaneity. To solve the constrained finitehorizon optimal control problem, a model based optimized dynamic terminal controller is proposed to drive the system state into a terminal region as tracking error compensation.

In this paper, we propose to solve this problem from three aspects, (i) defining accident models for intersections and straight roads where pedestrian accidents frequently occur, (ii) estimating the degree of risk by exploiting pedestrian context information, and (iii) differentiating pedestrian transmissions with different transmission intervals and channel access priorities so that messages from pedestrians in high risk can be quickly and reliably sent to potentially colliding vehicles. The proposed scheme is implemented via network simulator and extensively evaluated. Experimental results confirm that in dense scenarios with a large number of pedestrians, the proposed scheme can greatly improve packet delivery rate of pedestrians in high risk compared with the conventional schemes.","","978-1-4673-9114-6978-1-4673-9113","10.1109/ICVES.2015.7396891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396891","","Vehicles;Accidents;Context;Roads;Reliability;Sensors;Hidden Markov models","pedestrians;telecommunication congestion control;ubiquitous computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","pedestrian-to-vehicle communication;accident models;pedestrian accidents;pedestrian context information;pedestrian transmissions;transmission intervals;channel access priorities;packet delivery rate","","2","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because safety and reliability are particularly crucial for automotive systems, the worst-case response times of signals transmitted by electronic control units must be under their deadlines. To increase the bandwidth utilization, the slotmultiplexing (SM) mechanism that is allowable in protocol specification was adopted to schedule messages offline in the dynamic segment of the FlexRay protocol, and this mechanism was also considered in the timing analysis. The proposed method was feasible to calculate worst-case response time of message under any bus load when considered slot-multiplexing. Then the approach was applied to a Society of Automotive Engineers benchmark to ensure that all messages were schedulable. The simulation results revealed that by using slot-multiplexing, only 17 identifiers were used, which was less than 23 identifiers that were needed when the slot-multiplexing was not considered.

The present study aims to establish a methodology for using an ADAS to achieve compatibility between decreasing the driver's workload and increasing the driver's skill. The present study focused on the assist system by haptic shared control (HSC) for backward parking maneuvers, which are considered to be a demanding task for novice drivers. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of the HSC gain settings on the performance increase during and after the use of the system. First, we proposed a method to assist the driver's parking operation using the HSC. The proposed method displays torque around the steering wheel based on vehicle position feedback to reduce its error from the desired position, and steering angle feedback to reduce its error from the desired steering wheel angle, as determined by the preview driver model. Driving simulator experiments with various combinations of feedback gains demonstrated that skill improvements were achieved after and during the intervention when a higher gain is employed in the steering angle feedback term.","","978-1-4673-9114-6978-1-4673-9113","10.1109/ICVES.2015.7396912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396912","","Vehicles;Trajectory;Wheels;Torque;Haptic interfaces;Conferences","driver information systems;feedback;haptic interfaces;steering systems;traffic control;wheels","steering angle feedback;vehicle position feedback;steering wheel;HSC;haptic shared control;advanced driver assistance system;backward parking assist;skill development","","1","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose to integrate the perceived data from 3D LIDAR and stereo camera using particle swarm optimization algorithm, without the aid of any external calibration aids. The proposed optimisation algorithm automatically calibrates and registers the LIDAR range image and stereo depth image, as a precursor to the sensor fusion. Multiple parameters are optimised by adopting a model-based approach during the parameter estimation phase. The evaluation of the parameters is performed using a novel depth-based cost function. During the sensor fusion phase, the optimised parameters are used to generate the LIDAR range image, which functions as the disparity range image for the Viterbi-based stereo disparity estimation. The disparity range image constrains the Viterbi search during the stereo disparity estimation. To evaluate our proposed algorithm, the calibration and registration algorithm is compared with baseline algorithms on multiple datasets acquired with varying illuminations. Compared to the baseline algorithms, we show that our proposed algorithm demonstrates better accuracy. We also demonstrate that integrating the LIDAR range image within the stereo's disparity estimation results in an improved disparity map with significant reduction in the computational complexity.","","978-1-4673-9114-6978-1-4673-9113","10.1109/ICVES.2015.7396923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396923","","Laser radar;Calibration;Sensor fusion;Cameras;Estimation;Three-dimensional displays","calibration;optical radar;parameter estimation;particle swarm optimisation;sensor fusion;stereo image processing;Viterbi detection","automatic calibration;lidar registration;stereo camera;3D LIDAR;particle swarm optimization;LIDAR range image;stereo depth image;sensor fusion;parameter estimation phase;depth-based cost function;Viterbi-based stereo disparity estimation;Viterbi search","","3","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though, an accurate automatic 3D building map reconstruction is challenging in dense urban areas, in which buildings are located close to each other. In general, 3D building map can be generated from adding accurate height information of the building roofs to a detailed 2D map. But 2D building maps usually only provide footprint of the buildings which is not enough for 3D shape modeling of complicated buildings in urban areas such as Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan. On the other hand, with the development of laser scanning technology, airborne laser scanning (ALS) has now become easily accessible for large scale 3D mapping. However, an automatic 3D map reconstruction using only airborne point cloud is not feasible for dense urban areas, because of the difficulty of defining boundary of each building individually. This paper presents an automatic 3D building map reconstruction technique which integrates airborne laser point cloud with 2D boundary map.

However, these optimizations assume complete information on the route properties ahead. To evaluate the impact of look-ahead data quality on the predictive operational strategies of passenger vehicles, the fuel consumption of different optimized speed trajectories are simulated. The fuel consumption of a speed trajectory with perfect knowledge is then compared to the energy needs of different speed trajectories generated on the same route by optimization methods based on erroneous look-ahead data. In the tested scenarios, optimized velocity trajectories show in most of the cases same or better fuel consumption than constant, non-optimized speed profiles, even if they are based on erroneous map data.

However, these systems become expensive and complicated for dedicated usage. To solve these problems, we have proposed a recognition method of the vehicle code using infrared laser radar. We set up a two-dimensional code created by reflectors on the vehicle, and acquire the vehicle information by reading the reflector code by infrared laser radar.

For this purpose, we developed a low computational- cost method of detecting and tracking a parking spot in real time using 1-D OF measurements around the vehicle as well as the vehicle's longitudinal velocity and steering angle. The algorithm used was composed of 5 processing steps, which will be described here in detail. In this initial report, we will first present some results obtained in a highly simplified 2-D parking simulation performed using Matlab/Simulink software, before giving some preliminary experimental results obtained with the first step in the algorithm in the case of a vehicle equipped with two 6- pixel LMSs. The results of the closed-loop simulation show that up to a certain noise level, the simulated vehicle detected and tracked the parking-spot assessment in real time. The preliminary experimental results show that the average refresh frequency obtained with the LMSs was about 2-3 times higher than that obtained with standard ultrasonic sensors and cameras, and that these LMSs therefore constitute a promising alternative basis for designing new automatic parking systems.","","978-1-4673-9114-6978-1-4673-9113","10.1109/ICVES.2015.7396901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396901","","Vehicles;Visualization;Sensor systems;Cameras;Optical sensors;Optical variables measurement","computerised instrumentation;flow sensors;mathematics computing;optical sensors;vehicles","noise level;closed-loop simulation;Matlab/Simulink software;vehicle steering angle;vehicle longitudinal velocity;parking spot;bio-inspired 1-D optical flow sensors;automatic parking system","","1","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the SLAM technology, the 3D building model becomes an important aid to many positioning methods such as LiDAR and GPS positioning methods. To build accurate 3D building models, the accurate building footprint (the boundary of the building) is required. In this study, we propose an innovative method to correct the errors of building footprint on the 3D map by using GPS signal. In the urban canyon, GPS signal will be blocked by the buildings and only its reflection signal is received, which is well-known as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception. These reflections are potentially capable of indicating the correct position of the buildings. By using of a rough 3D building model, we apply it with a GPS ray-tracing method to track the simulated reflection path of the NLOS GPS. Theoretically, the length of observed reflection path, which is well-known as pseudorange measurement, and the length of simulated reflection path should be very similar. However, if the 3D map is not accurate, the difference between the observed pseudorange and simulated pseudorange will be detected. To utilize this fact, the proposed method is able to estimate the true position of the wall on the 3D map. The experiment results show that the proposed method successfully corrected the footprint of the rough 3D building model into about 1 meter accuracy. Importantly, the proposed method is capable of rectifying the building model only if several reflections GPS signals can be received from a same building.","","978-1-4673-9114-6978-1-4673-9113","10.1109/ICVES.2015.7396907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396907","","Buildings;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Global Positioning System;Ray tracing;Reflection;Delays","buildings (structures);Global Positioning System;ray tracing","3D building models;GPS;vehicle;autonomous driving;simultaneous localization and mapping technology;LiDAR;building footprint;3D map;non-line-of-sight reception;ray-tracing method","","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome this drawback a fast algorithm is presented to optimize the velocity of a vehicle with known route slope. Using this algorithm the consumption for five real world scenarios is simulated and compared against a constant velocity policy. The results achieved for the conventional vehicle are comparable to real-world results reported in other articles and offer about 20% fuel saving using free-wheeling compared to driving with a constant velocity.

The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide sub-meter accuracy with respect to positioning error mean.","","978-1-4673-9114-6978-1-4673-9113","10.1109/ICVES.2015.7396908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396908","","Vehicles;Three-dimensional displays;Roads;Buildings;Cameras;Ray tracing;Optical filters","object detection;road vehicles;satellite navigation","2D map;changing behavior;lane keeping;lane marking detection;visual information;road surface;error mitigation;urban canyon;multipath propagation effect;nonline-of-sight propagation;autonomous driving;urban environment;robust vehicle self-localization;vision-based road marking detection;3D-map-GNSS positioning technique;vehicle positioning error correction","","1","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
