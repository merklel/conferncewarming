However, traditional passive safety systems such as seat belts, airbags, and air curtains have been developed only for the driver or passengers sitting on forward facing seats. In this paper, we propose a pre-crash safety system for an occupant sitting on a backward facing seat in front-end crashes. The proposed safety system starts to move the seat horizontally and tilt the seatback prior to a front-end collision to reduce crash force which may cause whiplash injury. The simulated results show a remarkable improvement in reduction of crashing force impact on occupant's whiplash injury using Honda Accord models posted on National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the hybrid III dummies with MADYMO 7.6 simulator.","","978-1-5090-5677-4978-1-5090-5678","10.1109/ICVES.2017.7991920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991920","","Safety;Injuries;Force;Neck;Vehicle crash testing;Computer crashes;Simulation","impact (mechanical);impact testing;road safety;seats;vehicle dynamics","precrash safety system;occupant sitting;backward facing seat;fully automated vehicles;frontal crash;passive safety system;front-end collision;crash force reduction;whiplash injury;crashing force impact reduction;Honda Accord model;national highway traffic safety administration;NHTSA;hybrid III dummies;MADYMO 7.6 simulator","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, the conflicting data delivery requirements of safety applications can potentially jeopardize safety itself. While many information dissemination techniques have been proposed to improve data delivery in a VANET, such as flooding and geocasting, evaluations do not focus on measuring safety efficiency in terms of safety application requirements and often fail to include mobility considerations, such as time to contact (TTC). To improve safety in a VANET, we propose SafeRelay, a flooding-based message dissemination technique that relays safety messages within a geographically addressed forwarding zone (FZ). We evaluate different forwarding zone sizes in terms of several metrics, including safety awareness probability, which combines both communications and mobility performance. Simulation results of an urban downtown scenario show that SafeRelay can significantly improve safety awareness using moderately-sized nearby forwarding zones.","","978-1-5090-5677-4978-1-5090-5678","10.1109/ICVES.2017.7991899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991899","VANET;safety awareness;routing;flooding;geocast;geoaddressing;TTC","Vehicular ad hoc networks;Floods;Relays;Measurement;Routing;Vehicles","information dissemination;probability;relay networks (telecommunication);road safety;vehicular ad hoc networks","SafeRelay;time-constrained VANET;vehicular ad hoc network;geoaddresing relay;safety messages;data delivery;information dissemination techniques;safety efficiency;flooding-based message dissemination technique;forwarding zone;safety awareness probability","","2","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Japan, it is reported by a medical doctor that the most of the illness causing serious traffic accident is induced by heart abnormalities. This situation is concerned along with coming aging society. Non-contact monitoring using a Doppler sensor is one of the attractive solutions for this matter since there is no need to put sensors on the body of drivers. Doppler sensor module radiates an electro-magnetic wave and receives reflected waves yielded by human bodies so that it outputs the frequency deviation between the transmitted- and the received waves. We can detect the heartbeats through signal processing of the output of the Doppler sensor module, because this frequency deviation is caused by the movement of the body surface relevant to heartbeats. In this paper, we newly propose a very simple signal processing scheme to detect heartbeat variations of car drivers. The proposed method is capable of detecting even slight variations, so it surely detects the large variation of heartbeats observed at the sudden illness caused by heart abnormalities. In addition to the performance of the detection, it is also emphasized that the proposed scheme can monitor multiple persons at the same time.","","978-1-5090-5677-4978-1-5090-5678","10.1109/ICVES.2017.7991919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991919","","Sensors;Doppler effect;Heart beat;Automobiles;Monitoring;Receivers","biomechanics;biomedical equipment;biomedical measurement;cardiology;diseases;Doppler measurement;medical disorders;medical signal processing;patient monitoring","noncontact measurement;heartbeat variations;car drivers;sudden illness;serious traffic accident;medical doctor;aging society;noncontact monitoring;Doppler sensor module;electromagnetic wave;reflected wave receiver;frequency deviation;signal processing;Doppler sensor module;body surface movement;heart abnormalities","","2","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system incorporates two different sensor concepts: An optical system intended for heart activity monitoring and a magnetic induction (MI) system for respiration monitoring. The optical sensor system emits infrared (IR) light from LEDs towards the body of the driver. A part of the light passes through the clothing of the driver, is reflected in the body and detected by a photosensor in the optical sensor system. Light reflection varies during heart beat intervals and can hence be used for heart beat detection. The MI system is composed of a high-frequency oscillator incorporating an embroidered coil on the safety belt. During inspiration, the orientation of the driver changes with respect to the coil, which, due to a change in permittivity, results in a frequency change. Hence, respiration can be detected by observing the oscillator frequency. The belt-integrated sensor system has been evaluated in a laboratory experiment. Using a reference ECG as heart beat reference and a piezoelectric sensor belt strapped around the thorax as a respiration reference, the feasibility of the sensor system was investigated. First results showed a readily apparent respiratory signal and a good heart beat signal.

Accordingly, this paper proposes the architecture for using three different categories of V2X communications schemes in off-road environments over multiple autonomous vehicles. The proposed schemes are inter-vehicle communication via Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V), bidirectional communication with pedestrians via Vehicle-To-Pedestrian (V2P) and Pedestrian-To-Vehicle (P2V), and bidirectional communication with infrastructure via Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I) and Infrastructure-To-Vehicle (I2V). Over three different scenarios, numerous experiments were performed for each communication scheme.

The motion of Emergency Vehicles (EVs) like Ambulances, police, and firefighting vehicles are highly affected by traffic Congestion, by which rescue time may cost a life. The Priority Level Mutualism for Emergency Vehicle (PLMEV) algorithm aims to reduce the waiting time by giving higher priority for the EVs at the intersection. According to the vehicle's priorities, The Game Theory will control the traffic at the intersection. The PLMEV classifies EVs according to their emergency levels. The algorithm has a highly scalable property with a different number of vehicles. Also, has adaptive property to different vehicle type distribution and work with multiple EVs. Simulation evaluates the PLMEV's performance by comparing it with the Fixed Traffic Control System. The Simulation's results proved that The PLMEV reduced the waiting time for EVs to 42.7% on average, on the other hand, the normal vehicle's time has been reduced to 15.1% on average, while the maximum vehicle waiting time is reduced to 22.3% on average.

Its application can be broadly found in intelligent transportation systems like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or autonomous vehicles. One objective is to monitor the trajectory and behavior of the vulnerable road users (VRUs), e.g., pedestrians and cyclists, to prevent the probable collisions. However, the tracking of VRUs is still challenging, especially in cases, where severe occlusion occurs and the tracker fails due to the abrupt change of object appearance. To tackle this problem we propose a new tracking approach leveraging the part based trackers, which are built based on correlation filters. In this method both the number and the size of part filters are adapted to the current appearance of the object, to eliminate the influence by occluded parts. Experimental results show that our tracker performs robust with respect to occlusions, especially in cases, where long term and severe occlusions appear.

Insurance research estimates up to 40 % of all claims and up to 30 % of all claim-associated costs around the world are caused by these type of accidents. Therefore, a 360° low speed autonomous emergency braking system could have a high monetary effectiveness. To design such a system, parameters like initial accident velocity and environmental properties (like lighting and surface conditions) for an effective actuation strategy have to be derived. Firstly, this paper uses a state-of-the-art approach: an analysis of an accident database of reconstructed crashes. Due to the low velocity at parking and maneuvering, the tolerance caused within the accident reconstruction and the usability for further effective assessment were discussed. Secondly, a naturalistic big data analysis and a real-world accidents approach were conducted. Naturalistic driving studies enable a more precise evaluation of parking and maneuvering behavior.

HPM is designed to (1) recover collinearity in the vertical direction and (2) create a sweeping panorama in the horizontal direction, such that it effectively normalize the appearances of vertically long objects like pedestrians in the full horizontal FOV. Using HPM warping as a preprocessing of the image input, conventional detectors (e.g. Faster r-cnn (FRCN) and DPM) can be used for rearview pedestrian detection without losing a wide horizontal FOV. In our evaluations, log-average miss rate of pretrained FRCN were reduced from 80.1 to 24.6 percents in the marginal view angle range using HPM.

In recent years, deep learning classification methods, in particular convolutional neural networks, combined with multi-modality images applied on different fusion schemes have achieved great performances in computer vision tasks. For the pedestrian recognition task, the late-fusion scheme outperforms the early and intermediate integration of modalities. In this paper, we focus on improving and optimizing the late-fusion scheme for pedestrian classification on the Daimler stereo vision data set. We propose different training methods based on Cross-Modality deep learning of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): (1) a correlated model, (2) an incremental model and, (3) a particular cross-modality model, where each CNN is trained on one modality, but tested on a different one. The experiments show that the incremental cross-modality deep learning of CNNs achieves the best performances. It improves the classification performances not only for each modality classifier, but also for the multi-modality late-fusion scheme. The particular cross-modality model is a promising idea for automated annotation of modality images with a classifier trained on a different modality and/or for cross-dataset training.","","978-1-5090-5677-4978-1-5090-5678","10.1109/ICVES.2017.7991914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991914","","Training;Machine learning;Computer vision;Optical imaging;Neural networks;Stereo vision;Support vector machines","computer vision;feedforward neural nets;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;pedestrians;stereo image processing","pedestrian recognition;cross-modality deep learning methods;pedestrian detection;automotive;deep learning classification methods;convolutional neural networks;multimodality images;computer vision tasks;modality early integration;modality intermediate integration;pedestrian classification;cross-dataset training;modality image automated annotation;multimodality late-fusion scheme;modality classifier;cross-modality model;incremental model;correlated model;CNN;Daimler stereo vision data set","","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the estimated area of sight, we augment the sensory perceived environment with potentially present, but not perceivable, critical scene entities. For those potentially present scene entities, we predict a, for the ego driver, worst-case-like behavior and evaluate the upcoming collision risk. This risk model can then be employed to enrich the traffic scene analysis with potentially upcoming hazards, which result from a restricted sensory coverage. Furthermore, it can be utilized to evaluate the driver's current behavior in terms of risk, warn the driver in case its current behavior is considered as critical and give suggestions on how to act in a risk-aversive way.

To improve the overall navigation accuracy, this paper proposed a combination of the following two approaches for the loosely coupled integrated system: (1) using the MEMS error coefficients derived from Allan variance analysis for Kalman filter (KF) tuning; and (2) providing additional measurements based on the knowledge of vehicle kinematic features for SINS error correction. In the second method, body velocity constraint and an improved zero velocity updates (ZUPT) method assisted by accelerometers are described. Road tests utilizing an automated vehicle in urban areas demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for reducing the rapid SINS drifts during GNSS outages.","","978-1-5090-5677-4978-1-5090-5678","10.1109/ICVES.2017.7991909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991909","","Sensors;Mathematical model;Accelerometers;Gyroscopes;Urban areas;Global Positioning System","automotive electrics;error correction;inertial navigation;Kalman filters;microsensors;satellite navigation","global navigation satellite system;strapdown inertial navigation system;loosely coupled MEMS-SINS/GNSS integrated system;land vehicle navigation;urban areas;integrating microelectro mechanical system;inertial measurement unit;MEMS-IMU;MEMS inertial sensors;GNSS outages;MEMS error coefficient;Allan variance analysis;Kalman filter tuning;SINS error correction;zero velocity updates method;ZUPT method","","2","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed combined weight update and sampling step in a particle filter reduces the required particle density for tight measurement likelihoods and additionally improves robustness against map errors. We extend this approach to allow for mixtures of uniform and normal distributions for the intermediate belief estimate and the likelihood to make the system more robust against sensor outages. Simulations show the improved reproducibility of the new method while evaluation on logged data from downtown drives shows that we can reduce the error probability from above 20% to around 0.5% compared to traditional importance weighting - while at the same time keeping system availability stable around 95%.","","978-1-5090-5677-4978-1-5090-5678","10.1109/ICVES.2017.7991913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991913","","Sensors;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Robustness;Gaussian distribution;Global Positioning System;Cameras","cameras;distance measurement;edge detection;error statistics;Global Positioning System;image sampling;intelligent transportation systems;normal distribution;object detection;particle filtering (numerical methods);road vehicle radar","robust particle filter;lane-precise localization;downtown scenarios;geometric map;low-cost GPS;odometry;camera-based lane-marking detection;front radar;blind spot monitoring system;object detection;combined weight update and sampling;particle density reduction;tight measurement likelihoods;map errors;normal distributions;uniform distributions;intermediate belief estimate;sensor outage robustness;error probability reduction","","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the past few years, several commercially available vehicles are incorporated with increasing levels of autonomy. The Autonomous Transportation Operating Modules (ATOM) framework is proposed to organize and coordinate the development as well as testing of these autonomous systems. One of the most important modules is the path planning of the vehicle, and finding the optimal path between two points is of great importance as it is directly to power saving of the battery. Metaheuristic optimization techniques are widely used to solve complex problems in an acceptable time interval. In this study, three metaheuristic approaches; simulated annealing, particle swarm and ant colony optimization are investigated to find the optimal path between two points in a static environment. The results of the PSO outperformed the other two, opening the door for investigating its implementation on the embedded level for further demonstration and testing on real experimental platforms.","","978-1-5090-5677-4978-1-5090-5678","10.1109/ICVES.2017.7991897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991897","","Autonomous vehicles;Trajectory;Mathematical model;Sensors;Simulated annealing","ant colony optimisation;intelligent transportation systems;particle swarm optimisation;path planning;road traffic control;simulated annealing","ant colony optimization;simulated annealing;PSO;particle swarm optimization;complex problems;autonomous transportation operating module framework;autonomous transportation systems;ATOM framework;autonomous vehicle path planning;metaheuristic optimization","","1","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a lack of systematic parameter tuning approaches for optimizing the MMA performance. Thus, a novel integrated framework is proposed for a systematic calibration of the parameters of a post-processing MMA. The calibration approach consists of an Instance-specific Parameter Tuning Strategy (IPTS) that employs Fuzzy Logic principles. The proposed fuzzy IPTS tool determines the best algorithm parameter values by using instance-specific information a priori to the execution of the MMA. A preliminary prototype of an IPTS system is designed based on real-world data, which identifies the explanatory variables that condition the MMA performance. The implementation of the fuzzy IPTS tool on real-word data yields an enhanced MMA performance in the solution quality and computational time compared to the results of the execution of the MMA with constant algorithm settings.","","978-1-5090-5677-4978-1-5090-5678","10.1109/ICVES.2017.7991906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991906","","Global Positioning System;Algorithm design and analysis;Tuning;Tools;Heuristic algorithms;Roads;Calibration","fuzzy logic;Global Positioning System;intelligent transportation systems","parameter tuning approach;map-matching algorithm;post-processing MMA parameters;GPS measurements;digital roadway network;systematic parameter tuning approaches;MMA performance;instance-specific parameter tuning strategy;fuzzy IPTS tool;fuzzy logic principles;enhanced MMA performance","","1","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This cyber-physical system detects the number of riders waiting for the bus system at each bus station and number of riders on each bus. In this paper, we examine the security and vulnerability of the bus data collection system and provide remedies. Smart units are used to collect data (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) Addresses) to uniquely identify students' smart phone waiting times for the bus at each station. The goals of this system are to identify the average waiting times at each bus station, route optimization and dynamic routing. Several security concerns occur with the collection, transmission, and storage of data in the Cloud (e.g., Man in the middle attacks, unauthorized access, denial of services, theft, etc). We analyze some of these cyber-attack vectors and provides mitigation techniques, cyber hygiene best practices, and suggest ways to balance security versus convenience.","","978-1-5090-5677-4978-1-5090-5678","10.1109/ICVES.2017.7991908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991908","","Security;Wireless communication;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Communication system security;Transportation;Cloud computing","cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;educational institutions;intelligent transportation systems;security of data;smart phones;wireless sensor networks","security measurement;cloud-based cyber-physical system;intelligent transportation applications;wireless technology;academic environment;transit bus system;academic campus;bus station;bus data collection system;smart units;student smart phone waiting times;route optimization;dynamic routing;data collection;data transmission;data storage;cyber-attack vectors;mitigation techniques","","","","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For first evaluation, electromagnetic coupling is analyzed and signal quality is tested in laboratory environment: The sensor is based on the principle of magnetic induction measurement (MIM) but designed to have high influence of capacitive and mechanical coupling as well. The resulting signal is exemplary analyzed and indicates that the sensor is capable of measuring respiratory activity while the driver is in a resting phase like autonomous or highway driving. In the absence of respiratory activity, heart beats can be identified, but have a low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and need to be extracted by further signal processing. In the simulated driving situation using a gaming steering wheel in a racing situation with force feedback, high artifacts are induced due to movement. The results suggest that the distortion in the signal while steering has a distinctive signal course and a steer angle sensor could be of use for artifact removal. Furthermore, the proposed sensor could be used for driver activity monitoring in driver state estimation.","","978-1-5090-5677-4978-1-5090-5678","10.1109/ICVES.2017.7991923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7991923","","Couplings;Vehicles;Heart rate;Magnetic noise;Magnetic shielding;Monitoring","biomagnetism;biomedical equipment;biomedical measurement;cardiology;electromagnetic devices;electromagnetic induction;force feedback;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;signal denoising","electromagnetic coupled sensor integration;driver seat;noncontact vital sign monitoring;gradiometer coil;electromagnetic coupling;signal quality;laboratory environment;magnetic induction measurement;capacitive coupling;mechanical coupling;respiratory activity;autonomous driving;highway driving;heart beats;signal-to-noise-ratio;signal processing;simulated driving situation;gaming steering wheel;racing situation;force feedback;signal distortion;steer angle sensor;distinctive signal course;artifact removal;driver activity monitoring;driver state estimation","","1","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
