When the biological condition of driver is unstable, it can sound warning or provide the control strategy not only to reduce the possible damage to the road traffic safety caused by the driver's disablement but also the quantity of the traffic accident. In order to monitor the biological status of the driver in real-time, a continuous and non-invasive sensing system is needed. The method to enhance physiological signals by the designed optical device is the emphasis in this research. A photodiode at the front end presents the less design in optics. For the most part, the light source and the photodiode will directly lighting and receiving on the object without the components to boost the optical signal. Therefore, we develop the optical components that can boost optical signal and light-collecting efficiency, where the component aperture ≤ 5mm and the light-collecting efficiency ≥ 50%. A prototype static error of SpO<sub>2</sub>: 1% and the heart rate: 1% can monitor and pre-alert the biological status in real-time. If the driver feels the acute discomfort, it can be notified in advance, so as to promote the safety of the road user.","","978-1-5090-2933-4978-1-5090-2932-7978-1-5090-2934","10.1109/ICVES.2016.7548173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7548173","Optical Design;Biological;Non-invasive","Biomedical optical imaging;Optical reflection;Photodiodes;Vehicles;Heart rate;Optical filters","automobiles;driver information systems;medical signal processing;optical elements;optical information processing;patient monitoring;photodiodes;physiological models;real-time systems;road accidents;road safety;road traffic","driver physiological monitoring system;photodiode sensor;reflective optics element;driver biological status monitoring;car smart function;driver biological condition;road traffic safety;driver disablement;traffic accident;real-time;continuous sensing system;noninvasive sensing system;physiological signals;optical device;light source;optical signal;optical components;light-collecting efficiency","","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) which is designed for VANET suggests to apply multiple channels, i.e., service channels (SCHs) and control channel (CCH), to provide entertainment services and safety services. In order to improve the utilization of wireless channel resource, several Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are proposed by researchers. In some of those proposed protocols, mathematical analysis is employed to derive the optimal ratio between SCH interval (SCHI) and CCH interval (CCHI) to improve throughput of service packet. In this paper, we present a revised analytical model with limited retry limit to investigate the performance of multichannel MAC protocol. Subsequently, we observe the relationship between System's Successful Transmission Interval (SSTI) and initial contention window, leading to a proposed method to improve the performance of throughput and packet delay.","","978-1-5090-2933-4978-1-5090-2932-7978-1-5090-2934","10.1109/ICVES.2016.7548163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7548163","","Delays;Throughput;Safety;Analytical models;Media Access Protocol;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Vehicles","access protocols;channel allocation;intelligent transportation systems;mathematical analysis;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless channels","medium access control protocols;multichannel MAC protocol;vehicular ad hoc network;VANET;wireless access in vehicular environments;WAVE;service channels;SCH;control channel;CCH;entertainment services;safety services;wireless channel resource utilization;systems successful transmission interval;SSTI","","2","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While batteries and other technologies, that enable future vehicles to overcome the difficulties, are in development, it is already possible to decrease the energy consumption by applying an energy efficient driving behavior. Furthermore, the rise of V2X technologies have opened up new possibilities for safety and energy efficiency applications. This publication proposes a model predictive approach that makes use of a power-train model and a sequence of traffic lights over a finite optimization horizon. The optimization problem is solved in a unified manner, i.e. power-train properties and traffic light phases are not considered separately but evaluated in a single cost function. A stagewise forward-backward Dynamic Programming approach is used for optimization. In order to decrease the search space, the optimization works with alternating state components.

Consider that cross coding inductive loop wire based positioning and speed measuring system is a kind of wireless communication system, it is for sure to be affected and interfered by the complicated electromagnetic environment in along the track line in engineering application. Many related research have already been focused on the analysis of the interference elimination scheme in theory, few of them has taken engineering application into consideration, thus, many potential problems which might affect the positioning and speed measuring in practice are required to be discussed and analyzed via real vehicle experiment. In this paper, based on the experiment data collected in the medium-low speed maglev experimental line in Shanghai Lingang New City, several details in positioning and speed measuring system design have been discussed and optimized, and the corresponding improved results have been demonstrated.","","978-1-5090-2933-4978-1-5090-2932-7978-1-5090-2934","10.1109/ICVES.2016.7548179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7548179","medium-low speed maglev;train positioning;train speed measuring;cross coding inductive loop wire;engineering application","Position measurement;Wires;Encoding;Vehicles;System analysis and design;RLC circuits;Resonant frequency","interference suppression;magnetic levitation;radio direction-finding","absolute positioning technique;medium-low speed maglev train system;speed measuring method;lowest address code line;cross coding inductive loop wire based positioning;wireless communication system;track line;interference elimination scheme","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to build accurate simulation models, system parameters related to its linear single-track model need to be estimated based on the experimental data. Unlike other parameter identification methods, Hilbert-transform-based approach is capable of identifying the time-varying parameters with acceptable accuracy within the range of linear lateral dynamics. Besides, it has a powerful advantage that any time-varying properties of vehicle dynamics parameters even within a small time interval can be effectively identified and described with this method. Finally the method is applied to validate a complicated simulation model of a car-trailer combination obtained with IPG CarMaker software using the experimental data.","","978-1-5090-2933-4978-1-5090-2932-7978-1-5090-2934","10.1109/ICVES.2016.7548164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7548164","Hilbert transform;Parameter identification method;Time-varying systems;Single-track model","Axles;Vehicle dynamics;Harmonic analysis;Wheels;Parameter estimation;Automobiles","automobiles;automotive engineering;digital simulation;Hilbert transforms;identification;vehicle dynamics","Hilbert transform;time-varying vehicle dynamics analysis;parameter identification;simulation model;car-trailer combination;CTC;IPG CarMaker software;single-track model;STM","","1","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, how to effectively alleviate the traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of vehicles has become the main concern. Traffic signal control is one of the effective ways to solve urban traffic congestion. In this paper, a traffic signal control method based on Action-Dependent Heuristic Dynamic Programming (ADHDP) is investigated. The control algorithm is simulated on two intersections, both of which have two phases with four entrance approaches. The computer simulation results show that the control method has the better ability of on-line learning compared with traditional Fix-Time Control, and can effectively improve the average speed of vehicles, and reduce travel time and alleviate the traffic pressure.","","978-1-5090-2933-4978-1-5090-2932-7978-1-5090-2934","10.1109/ICVES.2016.7548166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7548166","ADHDP;Traffic Signal Control;Adaptive Control;Intelligent Transportation Systems","Mathematical model;Adaptation models;Dynamic programming;Traffic control;Training;Roads;Adaptive systems","automobile industry;dynamic programming;economics;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic control","intersections traffic signal control;ADHDP;Chinese economy;automotive industry;urban traffic congestion;action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming;online learning;fix-time control","","2","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This model is composed of two main parts: a multilevel microscopic scene model and a Hierarchical State Machine (HSM). The multilevel microscopic scene model is used to describe the complex traffic situation, and in some specific situations, the automated vehicle will interact with other traffic participants to obtain additional information. On the other hand, the HSM focuses on the decision-making process, which consists of two stages: the emergence of overtaking intention based on the RBF neural network (RBFNN) and the judgment of overtaking condition based on the rules. The presented model has been integrated in our vehicle ""Ray"" and evaluated in the man-in-the-loop simulation environments built with Pre Scan and Matlab. Experimental results show that the proposed decision-making model is feasible and reliable.","","978-1-5090-2933-4978-1-5090-2932-7978-1-5090-2934","10.1109/ICVES.2016.7548162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7548162","","","behavioural sciences computing;decision making;intelligent transportation systems;radial basis function networks","decision-making model;overtaking behavior;automated driving;freeways;multilevel microscopic scene model;hierarchical state machine;HSM;decision-making process;overtaking intention;RBF neural network;RBFNN","","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
