One of them is periodic safety message (PSM), the other is event driven safety message (EDS) which occurs as soon as the vehicles' status change abnormally. (i.e. change in speed or direction). As the control channel has to share the sync interval (SI) with the service channels, access to the control channel by the safety message is delayed during the service channel interval (SCHI). All safety messages generated during SCHI attempt to access as soon as control channel interval (CCHI) starts, which could result in flash crowd problem for the safety applications. In this paper, we propose group-based distributed periodic access scheme for the safety messages.

The proposed system provides an efficient and practical solution to such request, and also shows technical advances compared to earlier systems. It utilizes the lane markings for camera orientation calibration. At each image frame, multiple vanishing points of the lane markings are estimated using the weighted least squares method, followed by a tracking process with Kalman Filter for better consistency and robustness. With the filtered vanishing point the camera extrinsic tilt and pan angles can be estimated. Even though the proposed system relies on the lane markings for calibration, unlike other similar systems, the number of the lane markings in the system is not restricted, and the shape of the lane markings is also not restricted to straight lines or any other pre-defined models. A Monte Carlo evaluation scheme is devised for that purpose using real world driving sequences.

Rail can be used as a part of a track circuit. In an audio frequency track circuit, speedup and comfortable ride are offered. Some kinds of LRT do not have track circuits and do not use a fixed block system, however. Instead of a fixed track circuit, they use a virtual track circuit using software techniques. In this paper, a hybrid track circuit (HTC) is proposed using RFID antenna and reader on the cab and RFID tag on the sleeper. Also HTC is composed of software on the cab computer. Cab computers are a hot standby system for reliability and safety. 900MHz frequency is used and Eurobalise specification for housing is applied. Meanwhile, a simulator for testing a HTC was made. The maximum speed of the simulator was 500km/h. The proposed HTC can detect tags correctly for 500km/h high speed and constitutes an HTC well. The field testing of HTC was carried out at the Daebul test line. It is showed a potential for 80km/h. Soon a highspeed line test will be carried out at the Osong test line. HTC combined with tachometer can be used for ATO, ATP, and ATC application. Simple and low-cost HTC can be a key part of a railway signalling system.","","978-1-4799-1882","10.1109/ICVES.2014.7063708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063708","","Insulation life;Degradation;Polarization;Radiofrequency identification;Transmitting antennas;Rail transportation","radiofrequency identification;railway engineering;railways;signalling","hybrid track circuit recognition;HTC;railway signaling system;virtual track circuit;software technique;RFID antenna;cab computer;standby system","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over gapping of these end to end gaps often result in derailments. Therefore in order to prevent dangerous situations and ensuring safety rail lines are periodically inspected. Rail inspection in many countries especially in third world countries, like Bangladesh, is performed manually by a trained human operator who periodically walks along the track searching for visual anomalies. Such manual inspection is lengthy, laborious and subjective. This paper presents a machine vision-based technique to automatically measure the length of rail line expansion joint gaps using morphological processing.

Electronic differential constitutes a technological advance in electric vehicle design enabling better stability and control of the vehicle on curved roads. This paper presents modelling and simulation of an electronic differential employing a novel wavelet controller for two brushless DC motors ensuring the drive of the two rear wheels. The proposed controller uses discrete wavelet transform to decompose the error between actual and command speed as given by the electronic differential based on throttle and steering angle as the input into frequency components. These frequency components are scaled by their respective gains to generate a control signal which is given as input to the motor. To test the system, several simulations were carried out viz. vehicle on a straight road and vehicle driven on a road turning right and left.

VANETs are subject to attacks due to their vulnerabilities; one of the most compromising attacks is called Sybil nodes attack (a malicious vehicle pretends to be multiple other vehicles). Reported data from a Sybil attacker will appear to arrive from a large number of distinct vehicles, and hence will be credible.

In this paper we propose an effective heterogeneous solution to solve the congestion control problem in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) with the support of enhanced Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS) in LTE cellular systems. Specifically, we propose to adapt vehicles' beacon rates based on the emergency messages multicast update rate in eMBMS.

We propose a low cost alternative and normal visible camera based solution to detect co-vehicles based on vehicular light patterns (both head and tail lights).The proposed method first detects the vehicular lights in the camera captured scene based on color segmentation using SMPTE-C standard and color conversions. Our approach handles some extreme cases stemming from tail light diffusions. A heuristic rule set is used to pair the detected vehicular lights. The problem of occlusions is addressed by Kalman based predictions and validated with VWVF- Vehicle Width Validation Factor. Our results are promising with more than 90% accuracy in detection of co-vehicles in city roads and motor ways with single way and double way traffic.

Most of the systems do not allow maintenance or functional updates, especially in the field of driver assistance systems. Main causes are the testing effort for a software release and the wide variety of different configurations in different vehicle models. In this paper we take a closer look at the requirements for a middleware which allows such updates, verifies new software versions, and adds reconfiguration mechanisms for singular control units and distributed sets of control units. To derive the requirements we consider the general vehicular context with limitations in space, electric power, processing power, and costs together with four exemplary road vehicle control applications (cruise control, automatic parking, stability control, force feedback), and a full x-by-wire target vehicle for implementing these applications. The analysis of these three different sources of requirements results in desired middleware functionalities and requirements, especially concerning runtime timings and update timings. The requirements cover an update functionality with integrated verification, the exchange of applications on singular control units, and the degradation of functionality by switching between control units.","","978-1-4799-1882","10.1109/ICVES.2014.7063734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063734","","Vehicles;Control systems;Middleware;Mobile communication;Automotive engineering;Safety","","","","5","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here we introduce a car-sharing service of vehicle-following personal vehicles along streets in residential areas inhabited by elderly people. This study achieves a vehicle control function with high reliability, high accuracy, and ease of handling by a measuring device that uses a draw wire encoder. First, we consider background issues pertaining to transports and residential streets in Japan. Next, we give an introduction on vehicle-following technologies we have developed. We then describe a measuring device that uses a draw wire encoder for the proposed vehicle-following service, as well as the underlying control algorithms implemented by the measuring device. Finally, we report the results of experiments conducted on small electric vehicles (EVs).

By scanning the deployed QR codes, a Smartphone can pinpoint the host location and parking location efficiently. Based on the submitted location information, the central control system can finally return the recommended routes, which facilitates a host to reach the parking location effectively. In our model, the reverse car-searching route is divided into two parts: choosing the optimal exports (elevator) and computing the shortest walking distance route. Based on the optimal export selection algorithm and regional shortest path algorithm, our model can choose the prior exports (elevator) effectively, and then recommend the optimal walking route in the buildings and parking lots. The simulation shows that this low-cost system can effectively solve the reverse car-searching problem in large buildings and parking lots, save the driver's car-searching time and improve the utilization rate of parking facilities.","","978-1-4799-1882","10.1109/ICVES.2014.7063727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063727","","Vehicles;Indexes;Floors;Control systems;Navigation;Legged locomotion","automobiles;mobile computing;QR codes;road traffic control;vehicle routing","QR code location based reverse car-searching route recommendation model;parking lots;quick response code;smartphone;host location;parking location;central control system;recommended routes;shortest walking distance route;optimal export selection algorithm;regional shortest path algorithm","","3","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Adding to this, emerging technology like Internet-of-Things (IoT) wherein a large number of devices are getting connected to the Internet, thereby accelerating the rate of data generation. There are also future predictions that the number of devices connected to the internet is going to exceed the number of people connected to the internet. So there occurs the necessity to harness this large amount of data (mostly sensor data), convert them into useful information, make intelligent predictions and use this knowledge to build robust systems. In this paper we demonstrate the idea to build an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) using the Internet of Things (IoT) platform. The system has three components ; the sensor system, monitoring system and the display system. The sensor system has Global Positioning System (GPS), Near Field Communication (NFC), Temperature and Humidity sensors, which are always connected with the internet via a GSM network to track the location, commuter and ambience inside the bus. The monitoring system is used to extract the raw data from the sensors database, convert it in to a meaningful context, triggers some events with in the bus and provide information to the bus driver. The display system is used to show the context data (bus and travel related information) to all the commuters in the bus stop. We describe our prototype and show how this can be used as a fundamental component to build the ITS.","","978-1-4799-1882","10.1109/ICVES.2014.7063743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063743","","Databases;Global Positioning System;GSM;Internet;Servers;Temperature sensors;Context","cellular radio;Global Positioning System;humidity sensors;intelligent transportation systems;Internet of Things;near-field communication;temperature sensors","Internet of things;intelligent transportation system;IoT;data generation;ITS;sensor system;monitoring system;display system;global positioning system;GPS;near field communication;NFC;temperature sensor;humidity sensor;GSM network","","14","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accidents due to overtaking pose an even greater threat. Disciplined behavioral mechanisms of animal groups have promoted development in various technological fields including crowd simulation. On this basis, the proposed work develops Overtaking Possibility Check Algorithm (OPC) and the Overtaking Algorithm (OT) which operates on the front and the rear vehicles respectively. The algorithms provide a new mechanism for avoiding accidents due to overtaking by mutual communication between them. The various components of the proposed system work in collaboration to indicate the possibilities to overtake with detailed review of the recommended speed, trajectories. In other scenarios where immediate overtaking is not possible a suggested deceleration of the front vehicle is recommended. It is ensured that the safe distances are maintained throughout the process thus avoiding tailgating as well. The safe range space around the vehicle is considered to be delimited by an ellipse shaped boundary. The algorithm refrains to allow overtaking if the safe distances cannot be maintained i.e. if there is a significant amount of overlap between the ellipse regions of the vehicles. After the simulation of the above model it is inferred that algorithm's dynamic implementation in real time scenario could potentially reduce the number of accidents occurring due to overtaking.","","978-1-4799-1882","10.1109/ICVES.2014.7063724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063724","Overtaking Algorithm;Safe Distance;Vehicle Mutual Communication;Accidents","Vehicles;Road accidents;Roads;Particle swarm optimization;Animals;Heuristic algorithms","behavioural sciences computing;road accidents;traffic engineering computing","intelligent overtaking model;road accidents;animal group behavior;human lives;disciplined behavioral mechanisms;technological fields;crowd simulation;overtaking possibility check algorithm;OPC;OT;rear vehicles;front vehicle;safe distances;safe range space;ellipse shaped boundary;ellipse regions;real time scenario","","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method uses convex programming technique to optimize polynomial splines, which are numerically stable for high-order including large number of segments and easily formulated for efficient computation. Moreover, exploiting the differential flatness of system, these polynomial trajectories encode the dynamics and constraints of the vehicle and decouple them from trajectory planning. The framework is fast enough to be performed in real time and results in solution which is close to time optimal. As control inputs are computed from the generated trajectory in each update, they are applicable to achieve closed-loop control similar to model predictive controller.","","978-1-4799-1882","10.1109/ICVES.2014.7063726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063726","","Trajectory;Acceleration;Planning;Optimization;Splines (mathematics);Vehicle dynamics;Navigation","aircraft navigation;autonomous aerial vehicles;closed loop systems;convex programming;helicopters;path planning;predictive control;splines (mathematics);trajectory control;vehicle dynamics","autonomous navigation;generic quadrocopter;minimum time trajectory planning and control;convex programming technique;polynomial spline;polynomial trajectory;vehicle dynamics;closed-loop control;model predictive controller","","4","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Normally those can be assumed to remain nearly constant for everyday car trips, but looking at vehicles with very low curb weights, these parameters can change on a wide range due to different passenger or luggage loads. This effect is analyzed with several load scenarios. A Kalman filter based algorithm is presented that is able to determine all vehicle and tire parameters with standard sensors during random everyday trips and within short time. Therefore, an extended nonlinear vehicle model is defined that is able to represent vehicle behavior for everyday driving profiles very well. The estimator is validated using real-world steering and velocity profiles.","","978-1-4799-1882","10.1109/ICVES.2014.7063730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063730","","Vehicles;Estimation;Tires;Load modeling;Axles;Vehicle dynamics;Acceleration","Kalman filters;mechanical engineering computing;parameter estimation;road vehicles;sensors;steering systems;tyres;vehicle dynamics","real-world velocity profiles;real-world steering profiles;vehicle behavior;extended nonlinear vehicle model;random everyday trips;Kalman filter based algorithm;passenger loads;luggage loads;vehicle tire parameters;vehicle inertial parameters;yaw rate controls;vehicle dynamics controls;load-sensitive lightweight vehicles;virtual sensor;vehicle model parameters;tire model parameters;trip-synchronous parameter estimation","","1","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we investigate a 3D Point Cloud based solution for intersection recognition and road segment classification. We set up the intersection recognition problem as one of decoding a linear-chain Conditional Random Field (CRF). This allows us to encode temporal consistency relations between adjacent scans in our process, leading to a less error prone recognition algorithm. We quantify this claim experimentally. We first build a grid map of the point cloud, segmenting the region surrounding the robot into navigable and non-navigable regions. Then, based on our proposed beam model, we extract a descriptor of the scene. This we do as each scan is received from the robot. Based on the descriptor we build a linear chain-CRF. By decoding the CRF-chain we are able to recognize the type of road segment taken into consideration. With the proposed method, we are able to recognize Xjunctions, T-shaped intersections and standard non-branching road segments. We compare the CRF-based approach with a standard SVM based one and show performance gain due to the CRF formulation.","","978-1-4799-1882","10.1109/ICVES.2014.7063732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063732","","Roads;Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Robots;Global Positioning System;Vehicles;Decoding","computational geometry;image classification;image segmentation;mobile robots;object detection;object recognition;random processes;road vehicles;robot vision","linear-chain CRF based road intersection recognition;autonomous navigation;urban environments;road intersection detection;3D point cloud based solution;road segment classification;linear-chain conditional random field;region segmentation;mobile robot;beam model;X-junctions;T-shaped intersections;standard nonbranching road segments","","2","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
