Traditionally, automotive safety follows functional safety concepts as detailed in the standard ISO 26262. However, autonomous driving safety goes beyond ISO 26262, and includes other safety concepts such as safety of the intended functionality and multiagent safety. In this paper, we characterize the concept of safety for self-driving vehicles, and we discuss fault-tolerant techniques in the design of safe autonomous vehicles. We also propose a fault-containment protocol for the perception system of an autonomous vehicle that involves vehicle detection.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519488","Fault-containment;fault-tolerant perception systems;safety;self-driving vehicles","Safety;Autonomous vehicles;Roads;Software;Industries;ISO Standards;Automotive engineering","automotive electronics;fault tolerance;fault tolerant computing;ISO standards;mobile robots;protocols;road safety;road vehicles;safety","self-driving vehicles;fault containment protocol;functionality involving vehicle detection;autonomous vehicle;automotive safety;functional safety concepts;standard ISO 26262;autonomous driving safety;intended functionality;multiagent safety;safe autonomous vehicles;fault-containment protocol","","","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, AVs will be incorporated into RTS only if their benefit outweigh safety risks and, thus, it is mandatory assuring that they will be safe during their operation. In our previous work published on IEEE Transaction on ITS, we proposed the Autonomous Automotive Cyber Physical Systems (A2CPS) Engine, a conceptual framework for the AV Supervision and Control Systems (SCS). Supported by a consolidated, international normative risk management process and by a proven-in-use SCS architecture adopted in other transport modes, we advocated this run-time, vehicle-centric risk management concept could minimize the safety risks related to the AV operation. In this paper, the engine concept is implemented using Fuzzy Logic and embedded in an computerbased AV model. Its capability in managing safety risks related to the AV operation, including the impacts of AV behavior over the RTS safety, is assessed using a simulation-based safety analysis approach. As a result, we observe this AV is able to identify potential collision conditions, estimating and assessing its level of risk during runtime execution and mitigating the associated risks by speed reduction or stopping the AV. Concluding, the engine concept has potential to manage the safety risks related to the operation of an AV in RTS scenarios in an innovative, cost-effective and safe way.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519527","safety;autonomous vehicle;embedded systems;Fuzzy logic;risk management;simulation","Engines;Safety;Linguistics;Fuzzy logic;Risk management;Computational modeling;Transportation","cyber-physical systems;fuzzy control;mobile robots;risk management;road safety;road vehicles","consolidated risk management process;international normative risk management process;vehicle-centric risk management concept;RTS safety;simulation-based safety analysis approach;risk-based autonomous vehicle control approach;road transportation safety;fuzzy logic;autonomous automotive cyber physical systems engine;roadway transport systems;computer-based AV model","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To fulfil this requirement, control systems are included in commercial vehicles nowadays. These control systems consider variables such as lateral acceleration, roll rate and sideslip angle, that can be directly obtained from sensors or estimated from the collected data. With the objective of incorporating control systems without increasing the price of these vehicles, it is necessary to develop low-cost embedded systems, capable of acquiring data from a diversity of sensors to execute estimations and to perform control actions under real-time constraints. The increase of capabilities and features provided by smartphones enable them as data acquisition and processing devices. In this paper, an analysis in terms of reliability, accuracy and acquisition have been performed for two different smartphones in order to study the possibility to use this kind of devices as a low-cost sensing platform for vehicle dynamic applications. Each smartphone used in this study is classified into a different category (low-end or high-end device) depending on not only its price but also its specifications. Both yaw rate and lateral acceleration have been analyzed in order to quantify the performance of each smartphone. These variables have a direct influence on the vehicle lateral dynamics.

It must be suitable for the monitoring of car drivers due to its easy use. By using this sensor, we can think about an alarm system for sudden illness of car drivers preventing them from causing accidents. However, the problem is body movements of car drivers and the vibration of the car. The Doppler sensor observes the variation of the distance between the sensor and the human body because the distance variation is yielded by the respiration and the heartbeats. Thus, the body movements of the driver are destructive for the measurement as well as the car vibration. Obviously, they cause false alarms, so the measurement must be robust against the body movement. In this paper, we propose a new signal processing method suitable for vital sensing using a Doppler sensor. It is robust against disturbances caused by the body movement or the car vibrations. However, if these disturbances are serious, the proposed method automatically recognize the situation in order to avoid the false alarm for the car drivers' monitoring. In addition, the proposed method is applicable to multiple persons. The performance of the proposed method is investigated through computer simulations.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519507","","Doppler effect;Sensors;Correlation;Correlation coefficient;Automobiles;Signal processing","alarm systems;driver information systems;magnetic sensors;sensors;signal processing;spectral analysis;vibrations","signal processing method;vital sensing;Doppler sensor;reliable sensing;body movement;electrodes;human body;car vibration;false alarm;car drivers monitoring;accident prevention","","","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Survey: Engineering Challenges to Implement VANET Security","H.

VANET could be useful for awareness of vehicles in drivers' blind spots in situations that cannot be detected by cameras or radars. However, VANET has additional security difficulties to detect and exclude vehicles that are malicious nodes from the network, besides wireless communication's inherent security vulnerabilities, such as jamming, eavesdropping, and tampering, because nodes are communicating with each other directly and not through a base station or a server. On the other hand, DLT (Distributed Ledger Technologies) typified by blockchain is planned to take important roles even in the auto industry, for example, to record/control the information of a huge number of components or maintenance/inspection histories. However, these technologies still have technical limitations to cover time sensitive safety-related applications provided by VANET. Hence, this report first introduces VANET and its security risks, then addresses blockchain's opportunities in the automotive industry. Finally, this report concludes by discussing technical challenges on blockchain to be applied for VANET, for example, the consensus process to create a new block and 51% issue.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519503","Blockchain;cA(Certification Authority);certificate;consensus process;dLT(Distributed Ledger Technologies);v2V(Vehicleto-vehicle) communication;vANET(Vehicle Ad-hoc Network)","Vehicular ad hoc networks;Vehicles;Vehicle crash testing;Safety;History","telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET security;crash warning applications;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;vehicle ad-hoc network;road safety;driver blind spots;base station;distributed ledger technologies","","","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To gain these benefits, it typically involves small following distances (0.8 s - 0.3 s). Due to the small following distances, the cut-in manoeuvre of target vehicles becomes safety critical and requires the platooning system to take action as soon as possible. This work shows how machine learning can be used for the prediction of a cut-in manoeuvre of a vehicle, which we refer to as target vehicle, from a host vehicle perspective. A real-life driving experiment was performed to measure several cut-ins that were manually annotated. Measurements are gathered with a lidar installed on the host vehicle and consequently used to train several well-known machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Adaboost and an Ensemble of the previous models. The Ensemble model achieves the best results. This method is capable of predicting cut-ins prior to their occurrence, with an f<sub>1</sub>score of 62.28 % on the test set. Moreover, over 60% of the cut-ins are correctly predicted more than one second before the corresponding vehicle crosses the lane marker.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519594","platooning;cut-in;machine learning;predictive modelling","Support vector machines;Training;Machine learning;Automobiles;Safety;Machine learning algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence);optical radar;random functions;regression analysis;road traffic;road vehicles;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing;vehicles","truck platooning;cut-in manoeuvre;platooning system;machine learning algorithms;traffic efficiency;support vector machine;cut-in scenario prediction;automated vehicles;driving experiment;Adaboost;logistic regression;random forest","","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The collision avoidance with a vehicle, a pedestrian or any obstacle and the generation of a feasible continuous curvature trajectory represent the major problems faced by researchers to provide a safe path planning solution. This paper presents an algorithm able to avoid vehicles or obstacles by proposing a smooth local modified trajectory of a global path. The proposed method is based on the combination of a parameterized sigmoid function and a rolling horizon. The major advantage of this method is the reactivity to the obstacle motion and the generation of a smooth trajectory in a low execution time. The lateral and the longitudinal safety distances are easily parameterized when generating the avoidance trajectory. Simulation results show that the algorithm performs collision avoidance manoeuvres for static and dynamic obstacles in an effective way. The method is validated by applying the avoidance approach on real measured trajectory.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519525","Autonomous vehicle;path planning;obstacle avoidance;sigmoid function","Trajectory;Planning;Collision avoidance;Safety;Vehicle dynamics;Sensors","collision avoidance;mobile robots;motion control;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles;trajectory control","smooth obstacle avoidance path planning;overtaking;autonomous driving;safe path planning solution;vehicles;smooth local modified trajectory;global path;parameterized sigmoid function;obstacle motion;smooth trajectory;avoidance trajectory;collision avoidance manoeuvres;static obstacles;dynamic obstacles;avoidance approach;measured trajectory;continuous curvature trajectory;autonomous vehicles","","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially for safetycritical functions, the testing activities are essential to check if the designed system complies with the requirements. Nowadays, the continuous development of mobile electronic devices through software updates is performed almost on a daily basis. This trend is now starting to be observed in cyber-physical systems with higher safety priorities. In the automotive field, the rising software portion in the vehicles and the shortening technology life-cycles are accentuating the need for Software Over The Air (SOTA) updates. Despite the opportunities offered by SOTA updates, the current test processes and methods must be adapted to manage the resulting complexity throughout the life-cycle of the vehicles. Especially the typical variants abundance in automotive product lines is considered as an important challenge, which cannot be solved only by ”classical” testing methods such as Hardware-In-the-Loop. In this paper, we present a testing method for variantrich systems, which can be applied for automotive software updates. It uses virtual platforms for automated delta testing to handle the abundance of system configurations. Virtual testing is introduced as a powerful tool to reduce the amount of real tests and allow efficient variants verification. As a proof of concept, an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) composed of two ECUs has been implemented both in real hardware and using a virtual platform. With this approach, virtual delta tests, i. e. specific test-benches targeting the differences to a basic variant, can be rapidly executed for various system configurations.

Camera is the most popular technology, however, radar and LIDAR are increasingly being adopted more often in protection and safety systems for object/obstacle detection. In this paper, we particularly explore the LIDAR sensor as an inter-modality technology which provides two types of data, range (distance) and reflectance (intensity return), and study the influence of high-resolution distance/depth (DM) and reflectance maps (RM) on pedestrian classification using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Pedestrian protection is critical for advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and autonomous driving, and it has regained particular attention recently for known reasons. In this work, CNN-LIDAR based pedestrian classification is studied in three distinct cases: (i) having a single modality as input in the CNN, (ii) by combining distance and reflectance measurements at the CNN input-level (early fusion), and (iii) combining outputs scores from two single-modal CNNs (late fusion). Distance and intensity (reflectance) raw data from LIDAR are transformed to high-resolution (dense) maps which allow a direct implementation on CNNs both as single or multi-channel inputs (early fusion approach). In terms of late-fusion, the outputs from individual CNNs are combined by means of non-learning rules, such as: minimum, maximum, average, product. Pedestrian classification is evaluated on a `binary classification' dataset created from the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite, and results are shown for the three cases.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519497","Active protection systems;deep learning;lIDAR perception system;pedestrian classification","Laser radar;Feature extraction;Cameras;Sensors;Three-dimensional displays;Safety;Automotive engineering","cameras;computer vision;driver information systems;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object detection;optical radar;pedestrians;sensor fusion;traffic engineering computing","deep convolutional neural network;object-obstacle detection;single-modal CNN;binary classification dataset;early fusion approach;multichannel inputs;high-resolution maps;CNN input-level;reflectance measurements;single modality;CNN-LIDAR based pedestrian classification;autonomous driving;pedestrian protection;reflectance maps;intensity return;inter-modality technology;LIDAR sensor;safety systems;automotive robotics industries;perception systems;reflectance data;CNN-LIDAR pedestrian classification","","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, a deterministic machine learning model is built to recognize human-driven vehicles' driving intentions. Then, a situation prediction model is proposed to calculate the possible future actions of other vehicles considering cooperative driving behaviors.

To develop a combined driver distraction and intention model as well as an intention detection algorithm a real driving study with 45 subjects performing 1260 braking and 1890 evasion maneuvers was conducted and analyzed. The driver`s distraction level and hand position are varied to analyze their influence on driver intention. With a probabilistic approach, a sensitivity analysis of indicators for detecting driver intention was developed. The accelerator pedal and the longitudinal and lateral accelerations reveal to be most sensitive for evasion, while the longitudinal acceleration, the brake pressure and the accelerator pedal are most sensitive for braking. By using this sensitivities for algorithm design and combining them with information about whether drivers have recognized the object and their distraction level, evasion maneuvers can be detected correctly at least three seconds prior to passing the object in 91 % of all cases, braking maneuvers in 87 % of all cases. The driver`s distraction level turned out to be relevant for intention recognition, as 87 % of drivers reduce their distraction at least three seconds prior to passing the object. We conclude that drivers cannot have a relevant intention and be highly distracted at the same time. Driver distraction detection hence contributes to the driver intention recognition.

For those systems, a local route that represents the road shape is essential information for controlling a vehicle's behavior. When the local route is recognized by the perception sensors attached to the vehicle, the discontinuous information caused by the noise and detection failure worsens the driving comfort and stability. Since filtering methods in previous studies have caused time delays, the reaction of the vehicle control may be late when the curvature of the road changes. In this paper, the local route is temporary modeled into a mathematical form with several nodes to smooth the discontinuous information without delay problems. The node location of the temporal roadway geometry model is probabilistically updated by a Bayesian filtering scheme using the recognized local route. The proposed method was evaluated with a Mobileye camera and a real road. This method not only provided road shape information without a time delay but also interpolated the road shape information during the misdetection of sensor information and updating period.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519490","Bayesian filter;driving road model;local route;vehicle control Routefiltering","Automotive engineering;Roads;Bayes methods;Filtering;Estimation","Bayes methods;computer vision;control engineering computing;driver information systems;filtering theory;interpolation;mobile radio;object detection;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles;shape recognition;traffic engineering computing","lane recognition;Bayesian filtering;local route recognition;Mobileye camera;sensor information;road shape information;temporal roadway geometry model;vehicle control;autonomous driving system;intelligent Driver Assistant System;autonomous driving comfort;temporal local route modeling","","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, by a late detection of objects at higher speeds, the collision is hardly avoidable by braking only, hence an evasive steering maneuver shall be performed simultaneously to cure this deficiency. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes a dedicated cost function to make the appropriate maneuver decision in an imminent collision avoidance situation. By taking into account the host vehicle and the collision target motions as well as other moving or stationary objects in the near vicinity, diverse aspects and criteria are analyzed and discussed to evaluate possible maneuver candidates. After that, the cost functions of different maneuvers are calculated by summarizing the results of all the evaluation criteria and aspects. In both simulated and measured critical situations, the cost function is validated and the maneuver with the best (i.e., lowest) cost is selected to avoid the impending collision and the endangerment of any other road users aside.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519591","Collision avoidance;cost function;decision making;emergency braking;evasive steering;intelligent vehicle","","collision avoidance;decision making;driver information systems;road safety;road vehicles","stationary objects;moving objects;collision target motions;imminent collision avoidance situation;dedicated cost function;evasive steering maneuver;automatic emergency braking;automotive advanced driver assistance systems;automotive collision avoidance systems","","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, platooning can augment the road capacity, improve the traffic flow, and reduce emissions. However, existing studies do not take into account the impact of platooning maneuvers on traffic. Such impact can be particularly relevant as platooning will be gradually introduced, and automated vehicles will have to coexist with non-automated vehicles. Non-automated vehicles can interfere with the execution of platooning maneuvers, and hence have an impact on the benefits of platooning. In this context, this study analyzes for the first time the impact of platooning maneuvers on traffic (flow and speed) in mixed traffic scenarios where automated and nonautomated vehicles coexist. The study demonstrates that the traffic benefits obtained with platooning can be overestimated if platooning maneuvers are not properly modelled and taken into account during the analysis.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519515","Platooning;maneuvers;autonomous driving;automated driving;simulation;SUMO;Plexe;mixed traffic;traffic flow;traffic speed","Roads;Interference;Open source software;Shock waves;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Cruise control","road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;telecommunication traffic","platooning maneuvers;mixed traffic scenarios;traffic benefits;traffic flow;nonautomated vehicles;road capacity;reduce emissions;automated vehicles","","1","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, error detection code such as CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is employed and a message is retransmitted if any error is detected. However, message retransmission can conflict with real-time constraints due to extra communication delay and uncertain waiting time. Conventional error correction code can avoid message retransmission, but entails long decoding time or expensive hardware cost. In some recent in-vehicle network protocols, such as FlexRay and Time-Triggered Ethernet, redundant communication channels are supported. We propose a fast yet lightweight error correction scheme that exploits this redundancy, called DUCER (DUal Crc Error coRrection). This scheme largely avoids message retransmission without changing the encoding of existing protocols and can correct 5-bit errors for 254-byte payload in less than 1 ms. Compared to Reed-Solomon code, DUCER is one order of magnitude faster in software decoding or reduces area cost by 89% in hardware implementation.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519508","","Error correction;Protocols;Encoding;Payloads;Decoding;Generators;Delays","cyclic redundancy check codes;decoding;error correction codes;error detection codes;on-board communications;protocols","message retransmission;Reed-Solomon code;in-vehicle network communication;error detection code;Cyclic Redundancy Check;real-time constraints;uncertain waiting time;conventional error correction code;long decoding time;in-vehicle network protocols;Time-Triggered Ethernet;redundant communication channels;dual crc error correction;DUCER;lightweight error correction scheme;software decoding","","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they have a wide range of quality and accuracy, resulting in prices ranging from $0.55 to over $100 per unit. As it is often necessary to use a few units in parking assistants and those are deployed on a largescale vehicle production, the unit price is a critical factor. However, the simple choice of the lowest price sensors directly impacts on the measurements reliability, since they have high levels of noise in the values of their measurements. Therefore, this presents the results of the experiments using the Bayesian Recursive Estimation technique - also known as Bayesian Filtering - to increase the accuracy and reliability of low-cost sonar sensor measurements. A prototype is implemented and evaluated in simulated and real (physical) experimental environments. Using this approach, a significant accuracy improvement on distance measurements was observed compared to the raw data obtained from sensors.

The proposed controller integrates three different techniques; graph theory, Lyapunov stability and leader-follower approach. The controller structure consists of two main subsystems. In the first subsystem, a leader virtual robot is responsible for the trajectory tracking problem, actuated via a Lyapunov-based controller. Simultaneously, a graph-based controller is used to guarantee the convergence of the follower mobile robots to the desired formation using local positioning information; thus, ensuring the stability of the formation of the follower robots with respect to the moving leader. This new hybrid approach handles the problem of impractical velocities providing control inputs within acceptable ranges that can be practically implemented. Furthermore, it eliminates the oscillations in the motor inputs. Several scenarios are implemented to verify the proposed hybrid control algorithm.

For example, considering Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR), the design of the same traffic sign in different countries may be different. This efficient unit is explicitly designed for this rectification task and thus replaces the demand to substantially increase the network capacity. It samples input feature maps which are augmented by intra-class variations, and produces output feature maps compensating for these variations. This clearly simplifies the subsequent classification tasks. Also, the DSTN is light-weighted, and is suitable for end-to-end training. It is easily integrated into any existing network structure.

Therefore, it is essential to bring this system to a controlled virtual environment so that it is possible to determine their correctness and performance under these circumstances before their release. For this reason, Hardware-in-the-Loop testing methods have been increasingly utilized in the industry, with which real hardware is connected to driving simulation software and deficiencies can be identified in a early development phase.

For highly automated driving on highways, predicting trajectories of traffic participants is a crucial task for collision-free trajectory planning and risk-aware maneuver choice. For a prediction horizon of a few seconds the execution of those trajectories is fuzzy and highly dependent on the maneuver choice of the driver. This paper presents a new online-capable statistical approach for maneuver detection and uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction in highway scenarios based on detecting and clustering typical motion patterns in real highway footage and deriving prototypical trajectories for each cluster. The cluster prototypes are utilized for maneuver detection by evaluating their proximities to incomplete trajectory records while identifying for each prototype its most similar section. The remaining segment of the best fit is used as an estimate for the future motion of the traffic participant. Quantitative evaluation results demonstrate the potential of the proposed concept for maneuver detection and maneuver-based trajectory prediction.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519494","","Trajectory;Prototypes;Road transportation;Training;Labeling;Pattern recognition;Vehicles","collision avoidance;motion control;path planning;pattern clustering;pattern recognition;position control;road traffic;road vehicles;trajectory control","highways;traffic participant;collision-free trajectory planning;risk-aware maneuver choice;prediction horizon;maneuver detection;uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction;highway scenarios;highway footage;incomplete trajectory records;maneuver-based trajectory prediction;motion pattern recognition;intelligent automated driving functions;prototypical trajectories;clustering typical motion patterns","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This heavily relies on GPS, whose positioning performance, however, may be greatly degraded in urban canyons due to the influence of multipath error. In this paper, we first investigate the spatial correlation of multipath error. Then, we propose to estimate the multipath error at a pedestrian by (a) using a regression model and (b) Ieveraging the multipath errors at nearby points, which may be, e.g., provided by vehicles that happen to be there. Finally, the pseudo-ranges, corrected by removing the estimated multipath errors, are used to compute an accurate pedestrian position. The proposed method is evaluated with ray tracing simulation and 3D map. Compared with single point positioning without dealing with multipath error, the proposed method greatly reduces pedestrian positioning error by almost one order of magnitude, to 2.2m in the urban areas of Tokyo.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519513","Multipath error;Spatial correlation;Pedestrian positioning","Satellite broadcasting;Correlation;Global Positioning System;Receivers;Roads;Buildings;Ray tracing","Global Positioning System;mobile computing;multipath channels;pedestrians;regression analysis","pedestrian positioning precision;spatial correlation;multipath error;pedestrian-to-vehicle communication;pedestrian-vehicle distance;estimated multipath errors;accurate pedestrian position;pedestrian positioning error","","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this way, rail breakage detection systems based on ultrasonic guided waves (UGW) have been recently developed. In outdoor applications of these systems, different types of interference are usually added to the received signal, which makes UGW signals difficult to distinguish and analyze, even leading to false alarms and affecting the system efficiency. In order to recover UGW signals in these systems, the application of a variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm to denoise and reconstruct UGW signals is proposed in this work. This algorithm can decompose the received signal into different intrinsic mode functions (IMF), which some are useful signals and the others are interference. Removing the interference part and the UGW signals can be reconstructed. By comparing the amplitude of reconstructed UGW signal with a predefined threshold, the rail status can be determined easier than before. Furthermore, by calculating the deviation between the reconstructed signal after the VMD algorithm and the original one, the effectiveness and suitability of the proposal is verified through some simulation results.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519587","Ultrasonic guided wave (UGW);variational mode decomposition (VMD);intrinsic mode function (IMF);rail status determination.","Rails;Acoustics;Interference;Bandwidth;Receivers;Discrete wavelet transforms;Radio transmitters","acoustic signal processing;condition monitoring;railway engineering;signal denoising;signal reconstruction;ultrasonic waves","VMD algorithm;UGW-based rail breakage detection system;rail breakage detection systems;UGW signals;system efficiency;variational mode decomposition algorithm;UGW signal reconstruction;sound propagation;acoustic features;ultrasonic guided waves;UWG signal denoising;intrinsic mode functions","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an adaptive clustering approach based on a range/angle/velocity-grid generated originally from the radar signal processing and angle estimation stage. In contrast to an x/y-approach, multiple reflection points will not be merged into one single grid cell at close ranges, but keep their individual information in different assigned grid cells. A time and storage efficient process with a clustering window according to grid indices is implemented to search for the points with similarity in all three dimensions. In order to eliminate the parameter dependency and the incorrect clustering due to uncertainties of real radar measurements, this approach is extended with a model-based clustering window depending on the tracked and estimated object contour. By validation with various measurement data, stable clustering results with almost perfect true positive rates are achieved independently of the prevailing parameters and object types.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519483","clustering;automotive radar;3D grid;high resolution;DBSCAN;environmental perception;object tracking;imaging radar","","object detection;object tracking;pattern clustering;radar resolution;road vehicle radar;road vehicles","automotive high resolution radar sensor;object classification;radar signal processing;object tracking;object detection;angle estimation;adaptive 3D grid-based clustering algorithm;tracked object contour;model-based clustering window;grid indices","","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our work employs a face detection model based on mixture of trees with shared pool of parts to robustly detect the drivers face in varied environmental conditions.

The basic idea is to model vehicle trajectories as chains with adjustable joints and links. The characteristic parameters of these chains are chosen in accordance with the limitations due to driving dynamics. A key feature of the approach is that trajectories can be modified in a fast and intuitive manner, e.g., in order to avoid suddenly emerging obstacles. It is possible to simultaneously generate trajectories of multiple dynamic objects, taking into account interactions and dependencies between the objects. The trajectory chain model is extended by continuous collision detection, which allows collisions along a chain link to be covered with a single collision query. The simple structure of the chain model and the ability to react to dynamic objects offers advantages in applications in which a multitude of trajectories have to be calculated in a dynamic environment. The method was successfully implemented and validated by simulations. Its functionality is shown in collision avoidance scenarios.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519597","Motion planning;autonomous vehicles;driver assistance systems;collision avoidance.","Trajectory;Planning;Vehicle dynamics;Collision avoidance;Acceleration;Dynamics;Task analysis","collision avoidance;mobile robots;road vehicles","motion planning;flexible trajectory chains;vehicle trajectories;driving dynamics;trajectory chain model;continuous collision detection;single collision query;collision avoidance scenarios","","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an effective extrinsic calibration pipeline to establish the transformation between camera and LiDAR and update the decalibration online on an autonomous driving platform. We obtain rotation extrinsic parameters using parallel lines features in road scene, and infer translation extrinsic parameters by an online search approach based on selective edge alignment of point cloud and image. In order to evaluate our calibration system, it is first validated on KITTI benchmark and compared with the baseline algorithm. After that, the proposed method is tested on our own data. The results show that our method has a better rotation accuracy and demonstrate the necessity of error correction online.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519493","","Calibration;Cameras;Laser radar;Image edge detection;Three-dimensional displays;Roads;Pipelines","calibration;cameras;feature extraction;image sensors;mobile robots;optical radar;road vehicle radar;sensor fusion","translation extrinsic parameters;parallel line features;extrinsic calibration pipeline;LiDAR;KITTI benchmark;point cloud;selective edge alignment;online search approach;road scene;rotation extrinsic parameters;autonomous driving platform;autonomous vehicle;multisensor data fusion;line feature;calibration system","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our study is focuses in a specific maneuver: the roundabouts, and in the comparison between the brainwaves produced in that handling and in a straight section. For this purpose we made the same route in different moments of the day and under different weather conditions, and we isolate a specific stretch of six roundabouts and a straight one.

Sensors are one of the main drivers of costs for current prototypes of autonomous vehicles. As production volume increases, companies have to take into account this cost, and consider whether the increase in performance given by the addition of redundancy in sensing is worth the cost. This paper analyzes sensor fusion from a systems perspective, and proposes a method based on factor graphs to quantity the error given by a combination of sensors for the simultaneous localization and mapping task, as a function of the individual sensor capabilities. A total of 81 different combinations are analyzed, with 4 different types of sensors, and varying levels of performance and cost within each type of sensors. This analysis reveals several findings; in some cases, the addition of sensors can decrease the performance of the system by adding noise, and there is a cost over which performance stops increasing. Additionally, we quantity the intuitive idea that systems including sensors working in adverse conditions might still perform well if there are other complementary sensor to provide reliable information to the system.","","978-1-5386-3543-8978-1-5386-3542-1978-1-5386-3544","10.1109/ICVES.2018.8519529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519529","Localization accuracy;redundancy;sensor selection;systems architecture","Sensor systems;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Task analysis;Laser radar;Sensor phenomena and characterization","graph theory;mobile robots;robot vision;sensor fusion;sensors;SLAM (robots);vehicles","SLAM;simultaneous localization and mapping;performance quantification;sensors;sensor fusion;factor graphs;autonomous tasks;autonomous vehicles;sensing architectures","","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
