Many of these systems use proprietary information-communication-control-technologies (ICCT), among others, and for that reason it is difficult to integrate them into new industrial environments that require Industrie 4.0-compliances. The migration process of such industrial systems, i.e., retrofitting it into an Industrie 4.0-compliant, ICPS-Infrastructure, leads to the necessity of new features and components in the legacy architecture. This paper summarizes the process for retrofitting a flexible manufacturing system located at the Institute for Industrial Informatics, Automation and Robotics (I<sup>2</sup>AR) of the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, integrating legacy PLCs, RFID and commercial cloud technology on the basis of an Industry 4.0-compliant digitalization of components with OPC UA interfaces. With the use of common technologies recommended for migrating legacy industrial systems into Industrie 4.0-compliant systems, the authors describe the major specifications and characteristics of a migration approach and resulted novel ICPS-architecture that allows the operator and/or other legacy automation and management systems to monitor and control the PLC component via a RAMI4.0-compliant digital interface, via a retrofitted RFID System.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387646","OPC UA;Azure;Cloud Computing;Industrie 4.0;RFID;Industrial Digitalization;RAMI4.0;ICPS Architecture","Industries;Cloud computing;Radiofrequency identification;Servers;Automation;Computer architecture;Manufacturing","cloud computing;control engineering computing;flexible manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;programmable controllers;radiofrequency identification;software maintenance","industrial environments;Industrie 4.0-compliances;migration process;ICPS-Infrastructure;legacy architecture;flexible manufacturing system;Industrial Informatics;commercial cloud technology;OPC UA interface;migrating legacy industrial systems;novel ICPS-architecture;operator;management systems;RAMI4.0-compliant digital interface;retrofitted RFID System;legacy PLC-based automation systems;Azure cloud;retrofitted RFID system;legacy systems;production processes;proprietary information-communication-control-technologies","","2","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A cyber-manufacturing system (CMS), which is generated from ICPS, poses significant challenges on reliability, accuracy and responsiveness of computation services for manufacturing decision making. In this paper, we focus on reliability and responsiveness. Due to the heterogeneities of the computation and communication capacities and conditions, demanding computation services may not be completed in a timely manner. To facilitate reliable and responsive computation services, we propose a deadline constrained predictive offloading method based on a mobile-fog-cloud (MFC) network. This method optimizes the offloading decisions by solving a quadratically constrained integer linear programming constrained by latency requirements and predicted availability of devices. A newly constructed hybrid cyber-additive manufacturing network is used to test the performance of the proposed predictive offloading method and the MFC network. The results show that the proposed method outperforms mobile computing, fog computing, cloud computing, and fog-cloud computing benchmarks to minimize resource consumption and comply with latency requirements.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387654","computation offloading;fog computing;cloud computing;industrial cyber-physical systems;smart manufacturing","Handheld computers;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Cyber-physical systems;Smart manufacturing;Iterative closest point algorithm","cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;decision making;integer programming;linear programming;manufacturing systems;mobile computing;production engineering computing","mobile computing;fog-cloud computing benchmarks;industrial cyber-physical system;ICPS;physical processes;computation resources;reliable computation services;responsive computation services;reliability;communication capacities;predictive offloading method;mobile-fog-cloud network;offloading decisions;newly constructed hybrid cyber-additive manufacturing network;mobile-fog-cloud enabled cyber-manufacturing system","","1","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

RRT is constructed incrementally in a way that quickly reduces the expected distance of a randomly-chosen point to the tree. RRT is suited for path planning problems that involve obstacles and differential constraints (nonholonomic or kinodynamic). But the robot may collide with the obstacles when the classic RRT algorithm is applied. In this paper, the author proposes an improved RRT algorithm, which is called RRT-Rectangular. RRT-Rectangular is suited for path planning problems on the two-dimensional plane that involve static obstacles. RRT-Rectangular pretreat the map with the rectangular decomposition, and the map is divided into rectangular elements with different sizes. After that, all points that build the planning path are in the center of safe rectangular elements. So the robot moves only in the safe areas. The results of MATLAB simulation show that the length of planning path of RRT-Rectangular is closer to the optimal path than the classic RRT algorithm. Especially, the larger the number of obstacles, the shorter the length of the path planned by the improved RRT algorithm.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387656","rectangular decomposition;rapidly-exploring random tree;safety","Robot kinematics;Matlab;Path planning;Simulation;Planning;Aerospace electronics","data structures;mobile robots;path planning;trees (mathematics)","robot path planning;random tree algorithm;data structure;rectangular decomposition;RRT algorithm;differential constraint;static obstacle;RRT-rectangular;searching nonconvex space","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, for configuration interfaces to be remotely accessible, corporate networks need to be configured accordingly to provide access possibilities. Such additional access possibilities might then be used by adversaries when attacking corporate networks and thus, are often seen as a security weakness.

We show that, given the proxy locations in the network, the initial energy supplies of the nodes, a pattern of data requests from IoT devices, and the maximum access latency that consumer nodes can tolerate, the problem of finding how to distribute the data on the Edge nodes maximizing the network lifetime is computationally hard. We design an offline centralized heuristic algorithm for identifying which paths in the network the data should follow and on which proxies they should be cached, in order to meet the data access latency constraint and to maximize the network lifetime. We implement the method and evaluate its performance using a testbed of IEEE 802.15.4-enabled network nodes. We demonstrate that the proposed heuristic (i) guarantees data access latency below the given threshold, and (ii) performs well in terms of network lifetime with respect to a theoretically optimal solution.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390794","Industry 4.0;Data Management;Internet of Things;Energy Efficiency;Wireless Networks","Wireless communication;Industries;Production facilities;Schedules;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Internet of Things;Routing","distributed processing;Internet of Things;power aware computing;resource allocation","data access latency constraint;maximizing industrial IoT network lifetime;edge data distribution;distributed local data storing proxies;proxy locations;energy consumption;offline centralized heuristic algorithm","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The interaction between IoT entities and people's lives makes it more necessary to have full transparency such that people themselves can evaluate how the IoT affects their lives. Trust between people and IoT industry is a significant issue for a more mature IoT. This paper reviews the different aspects of social ethics in IoT including equity, equality, and trustability. Effects of IoT in social human life and vital factors are explained. We review different factors that can increase the acceptance of IoT.

Then, pheromone updating rule is improved to increase algorithm convergence speed and avoid local optima. Finally, the improved ACO algorithm is applied to the route optimization simulation experiment under the weather conditions. It has been verified that the improved ACO algorithm has better performance in route smoothness and convergence speed. The simulation results of MATLAB show that the algorithm can not only find a shorter distance route from starting point to end, but also ensure that the navigation time of the route is relatively short.

After the stages of data preprocessing and data fusion, by learning from the measures of the sensors integrated into the garment, a local decision support system has been created for linking fatigue or stress states to the measured physiological signals. In this way, this high level of information can be transmitted to the command center, permitting to make relevant global decisions for offering a better protection of firefighters.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390767","wearable system;Internet of Things;monitoring;physiological state;intelligent garment design;signal processing;decision support system","Clothing;Accelerometers;Biomedical monitoring;Fabrics;Microcontrollers;Intelligent sensors","body sensor networks;decision support systems;health care;intelligent sensors;microcontrollers;occupational stress;patient monitoring;protective clothing;sensor fusion;textiles;wearable computers;wireless sensor networks","measured physiological signals;wearable system;firefighter protection;lightweight garment;physiological state;microcontroller;health state;key health features;data preprocessing;local decision support system;sensors;knitted textile structure;fatigue state;stress state","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This interface uses not only conventional translational human motions but also twisting motion, namely it makes full use of the human motion characteristics. The mechanism of the interface consists of the saddle and universal joint connecting the saddle and personal mobility, and tracing loins motion. Due to these features, the proposed interface shows a potential to realize intuitive operation in the basic experiment. However, the problems have also remained: The height of the saddle should be adjuested for the users' height before riding on the PMV (Personal Mobility Vehicle). And there are plays between the saddle and buttocks of the user, and backlash of the saddle mechanism. This problem prevents a small human motion from measurment. This paper, therefore, proposes the contactless measurement using LIDAR and discusses the fitting methods from measured data points to human body movement.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390771","Human body motion;Fitting;Interface;Twisting Motion","Laser radar;Motion measurement;Sensors;Legged locomotion;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Biological system modeling;Gravity","human-robot interaction;mobile robots;motion control;optical radar;position control","saddle type human body motion interface;conventional translational human motions;human motion characteristics;tracing loins motion;saddle mechanism;LIDAR;human body movement;contactless measurement scheme;modeling human body movment;personal mobility interface including twisting motion;personal mobility vehicle","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a nontrivial problem since there are more machines connected to the industrial cyber-physical systems, and the list becomes so long that is hard to be read. Considering the characteristic that the industrial HMI is typically executed in a face-to-machine manner, the face-to-machine proximity estimation (FaceME) algorithm has been proposed to simplify the manual selection. However, due to the limited utilization of RSSI data, the estimation accuracy of FaceME is not sufficient in the application with densely deployed machines. In this paper, we propose the model to formulate the neighbor relations, and then design a new face-to-machine proximity estimation algorithm with neighbor relations (FaceMEN) to improve the estimation accuracy.

Therefore, we investigate how a forward secure logging mechanism can be used for intrusion detection and prevention purposes in such cases. The proposed defense mechanism can be summarized in security-related information gathering and fast forward-secure logging by an intrusion detection agent, in addition to log analysis, incident identification and response by a trusted server. We implemented our proposal on the OpenPLC framework as the proof of concept and we show how our proposed scheme can be effective in order to detect and prevent adversaries from running arbitrary code on the controllers. The performance overhead we measured on our platform is at most 54 μs per scan cycle, which confirms how lightweight the presented solution is.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390813","Industrial control system;Programmable logic controller;Intrusion detection and prevention;Secure audit logging;Forward-secure logging","Servers;Intrusion detection;Cryptography;Integrated circuits;Process control;Monitoring","control engineering computing;industrial control;invasive software;process control;production engineering computing;programmable controllers;system monitoring","prevention system;industrial control systems;security aspects;ICS;cyberwarfare;engineering research;advanced malware;sophisticated malware;industrial espionage;programmable logic controllers;chemical processing;industrial process steering;forward secure logging mechanism;prevention purposes;intrusion detection agent;process control;Snapshotter;OpenPLC framework","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An ideal Human Machine Interface should dynamically inform the driver of all of the system's functional limitations and driver's role. However, systems currently available in the market rely to some extent on such information given to the driver as knowledge at a dealer shop prior to driving or through mass-media. Since information acquirable as knowledge by users is limited, it is necessary that the information is given in a simple and comprehendible form. In this study, we compare user-oriented and system-oriented expressions for the information that explains that there are cases where a driver needs to intervene. This study conducted an experiment with a high-fidelity driving simulator where the ego vehicle was equipped with a Level 2 driving automation system. The results of the experiment suggest that expressions such as “you might need to intervene” (i.e., this is explained from the viewpoint of the driver) are better than expressions such as “the system may go wrong” (i.e., this is explained from the viewpoint of the driving automation system).","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390777","driving automation systems;human factors;education;safety;human-machine interface","Vehicles;Automation;Safety;Wheels;Manuals;Training","driver information systems;knowledge representation;man-machine systems;road safety","driver needs;high-fidelity driving simulator;Level 2 driving automation system;knowledge representation;driver performance;SAE Level 2 systems;ideal Human Machine Interface;user-oriented expressions;system-oriented expression;ego vehicle;object and event detection and response","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal is for the presented model to act as groundwork for the development of a cooperative UAV autonomous landing system. It seeks to overcome most of the downfalls of pattern-based approaches by instead using the UAV's innate motion behaviours to perform detection. Seeing that the sky is a fairly stagnant environment, objects are detected through a Background Subtraction algorithm. As clouds generally present a slow and progressive movement they are to be considered part of the background and all other objects (e.g planes, birds, UAVs) as foreground. The irregular motion patterns of the UAV, especially of its propellers, are used to create a movement signature that distinguishes the UAV from other objects. The signature is classified as an entropy metric obtained from the resulting optical flow over a number of past frames. To further improve the detection rate, a tracking algorithm based on a Kalman filter was developed. Experimental results obtained from a dataset encompassing 12 diverse videos showed the ability of the computer vision algorithm to perform the tracking of the UAV with an average performance of 93.4%.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390752","Computer Vision;Background Subtraction;Optical Flow;Kalman Filter;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;Autonomous Landing","Cameras;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Tracking;Feature extraction;Birds;Propellers;Optical imaging","autonomous aerial vehicles;image motion analysis;image sequences;Kalman filters;object detection;object tracking;robot vision;video cameras;video signal processing","motion signatures;position extraction;video sequences;sky;UAV autonomous landing system;fairly stagnant environment;irregular motion patterns;tracking algorithm;background subtraction algorithm;vision-based UAV detection;camera;object detection;entropy metric;Kalman filter;computer vision algorithm;optical flow","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, control systems are initially developed using average statistical estimates of the subject specific parameters. However, such excursions may lead to suboptimal designs. In this paper, we propose HyMn, a hybrid system parameter estimation tool, where the subject specific parameters in a hybrid system are automatically learned from experimental traces of the operation of a human centric CPS control system.

The Industrial PC is integrated within the fieldbus system of a Bulk Good Laboratory Plant providing superior network security as compared to an external connection to a cloud platform. Additionally, the Industrial PC provides predominantly better numerical computation functionality as compared to traditional PLC environment due to the availability of machine learning libraries in high-level languages.

To address these problems, a multi-task collaborative learning method is proposed based on auxiliary training and geometric constraints. Firstly, by virtue of the correlation between facial landmark localization and head pose estimation, a deep network model was designed based on joint optimization of these two tasks to simultaneously estimate the landmark coordinates and pose angles. Secondly, the auxiliary training technique was applied to enhance the feature learning ability of the network model through adding a back-propagation layer. Then, the geometric constraint algorithm was employed to pre-train the model and its related parameters are used for the initialization of the constructed model, in order to make the model to extract the invariant features of pose variation effectively. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated on the public database 300W.

However, these devices are often heterogeneous in nature, i.e. from different manufacturers, use different protocols, etc. and adds requirements such as security, interoperability, etc. To address these requirements, the Service-Oriented Architecture-Based (SOA) Arrowhead Framework was previously proposed using the concept of local clouds. These local clouds provide a set of mandatory and support core systems to enable industrial automation applications. One of these mandatory core systems is an Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting (AAA) system, which is used to authenticate and provide access control to the devices in a local cloud. In an industrial context, with multiple stakeholders, the AAA must support fine-grain access control. For example, in a distributed control loop, a controller should only have read access to its sensor such as a flow meter and write access to its actuator, such as a valve. The controller should not have access to any other information besides what is needed to implement the desired functionality. In this work, an NGAC-based AAA solution to achieve fine-grain service level access control between IoT devices has been proposed and implemented. The solution is presented using a district heating use case.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390799","","Authentication;Authorization;Protocols;Cloud computing;Standards","authorisation;cloud computing;distributed control;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;service-oriented architecture","industrial IoT devices;device-to-device communication;local cloud;industrial automation applications;distributed control loop;fine-grain service level access control;Internet of Things devices;service-oriented architecture;next generation access control;Industry 4.0;SOA Arrowhead Framework;authentication authorisation and accounting system;NGAC-based AAA solution;district heating","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, the performance of SPMSM sensorless (self-sensing) control is verified for the case when the estimated position signal is used to control the motor and with DC link voltage measurement only. The closed-loop control system combined with the nonlinear observer is also compared with the state-of-the-art industrial controller. It is demonstrated that the nonlinear observer achieves a significant improvement of the closed-loop performance in both low- and high-speed operation.

This is already supported through the inter-cloud orchestration process, carried out by the core systems of Arrowhead. This mechanism involves the administration of the connections, aided by Gatekeepers. Secure end-to-end data transfer, however, is still troublesome - especially in-between closed local clouds.

This paper contributes a novel study of the interplay between cyber and physical components in the coordination of electric loads where real-time scheduling is leveraged in both the cyber and physical domain. In particular, the relationship will be derived between the schedule enforced on electric loads (i.e., the physical components) and the one associated to processing tasks (i.e., the cyber components) that are executed by a computer to handle the loads. Power loads will be scheduled using a combination of two-dimensional bin-packing and optimal multi-processor real-time scheduling to coordinate their activation. The scheduling pattern of power loads influences the timing of processing tasks that are dedicated to the activation/deactivation of loads. The relationship between the two aspects is formally derived.

Reuse of control software of aMFS is commonly achieved through copying, pasting, and modifying existing control code from a similar system. When a module of an aMFS is updated in production, e.g. to resolve issues, the program code and hardware components are changed. The change is usually documented informally or resides only in the mind of the automation engineer. When new hardware is added to a module, the control software often has to be changed in many different parts, or a new control function has to be developed, which wraps the existing code. This way of handling the development and evolution of aMFSs is error-prone and reduces the software quality. A modular, model-based software architecture for aMFS can reduce the error-proneness and improve the software quality. In this paper we propose a model-based development method for aMFS. It is used to create a modular software architecture that describes composable modules. The models, their meta models, and the program code therein are coupled with each other via mappings and consistency rules, so that the consistency can be validated.

In this paper, we specify these requirements by reviewing industrial applications and identify the relevant properties of state of the art industrial networks.

On an inclined road, there is a high probability that a wheelchair will move in a direction that is different from that desired by its user. In our previous research, we proposed a system that estimated a wheelchair user's intentions and worked passively to complement their intentional force. This was accomplished by negating the wheel traction that was generated by the road's inclination using only the servo brakes on each wheel. However, in some cases, our system failed to assist the driving motion of the user because it negated only the gravitational force. Therefore, our wheelchair succeeded in avoiding the unintended movement, but its user was required to row the hand rims with a considerable amount of force to overcome these braking forces. Consequently, we proposed an upper body posture adjustment system that adapts to the inclined road conditions and reduces the wheel traction that is generated by gravity. The proposed system inclined the wheelchair seat and aligned the upper body posture of its user to the center position of the wheelchair. Using this method, the proposed system maintained the position of the user's center of gravity with respect to the center position of the wheelchair.

Abnormal behavior can be caused by issues such as operational errors or security weaknesses. Security weaknesses entail attacks that might cause serious harm for humans and production material. One possibility to mitigate such attacks is action authorization. In this paper, we propose an authorization mechanism for actuator actions on mobile robots to prevent adversaries from executing false commands on a robot. The mechanism uses a ticketing system and relies on sensor data as well as plausibility checks. The tickets are issued to specific actuators to authorize the requested action. The sensor data adds to the understanding of the current context and the plausibility checks are used to check that specific actions are allowed to be performed in a given order.

Cyber Security in general can be achieved through 2 main disposals: 1) a detection of threats from a monitoring of the environment followed by a detection of abnormal behaviors based on dedicated algorithms, and 2) an automatic system decides which reaction to take and finally apply this action (e.g. an alarm or a reconfiguration). Our approach aims at answering the questions: what happens if the automatic countermeasures fail, and therefore if and how the driver can detect or block the attack, or manage its consequences. It is based on the “human in the loop principles” and consists in testing the driver Situation Awareness in placing professional drivers and OCC operators (Operational Control Center) in a realistic simulator and playing scenarios involving attacks and observing their reactions.

Then vector product method is proposed to calculate the Jacobian matrix and the complex singularity problem is decoupled into quite simple position singularity problem and orientation singularity problem.

In a nutshell, BIM could be understood as a set of new processes to design, plan, and construct buildings, based on 3D virtual objects that represent different building components, and its mutual relationships. Nowadays, most applications of BIM processes are focused on the concept, design, and planning phases of the building lifecycle. Part of the reason behind that fact is that construction processes are still largely dependent of human labor, and dynamic connection between BIM models and real progression on-site during construction phase are almost non-existent. In exploiting the digitization promoted by the introduction of BIM, it should be important to consider the relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies to Construction. This papers presents a framework in which Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for Construction are based on virtual models of construction processes, implemented via Petri Nets, and connected to both BIM models, and to hardware (sensors and actuators) working in on-site production / assembly. Then, the proposed framework is “relaxed” and extended to be applied in a scenario where CPS are just a bi-directional link between virtual models and its real counterparts on-site, without hardware to be controlled, but with observations based on data acquired via sensing. Such proposition aims to concentrate efforts and promote the importance of process models in construction, and to provide simulation and optimization to the current processes based on data from real-time progression monitoring during construction and information from BIM models.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387690","Building Information Modeling;cyber-physical systems;IFC;Petri Net","Buildings;Data models;Petri nets;Sensors;Production;Business","building management systems;buildings (structures);civil engineering computing;construction components;construction industry;cyber-physical systems;design engineering;Petri nets;planning;process monitoring;virtual reality","construction industry;3D virtual objects;cyber-physical systems;building information modeling;building components;building design;building lifecycle planning;Industry 4.0 technologies;Petri Nets;real-time progression monitoring","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dynamic model of the diesel engine undergoes approximate linearization round a temporary operating point. This is defined at each time instant by the present value of the system's state vector and the last value of the control input vector that was exerted on it. The linearization is based on Taylor series expansion and on the computation of the associated Jacobian matrices. For the linearized model an H-infinity feedback controller is computed. The controller's gain is calculated by solving an algebraic Riccati equation at each iteration of the control method. The asymptotic stability of the control approach is proven through Lyapunov analysis. This assures that the state variables of the diesel engine will finally converge to the designated reference values.

Modern industrial processes leverage advanced IT technologies to increase productivity and often combine multiple system concepts such as Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Cloud Computing. Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are key enablers of this revolution. In CPPS, raw materials, machines, and operations are interconnected to form a sophisticated network. Protecting them against advanced cyber-threats is a priority concern for the future implementation of Industry 4.0 applications. Any impairment of such systems can lead, in fact, to catastrophic damages resulting in a substantial financial loss for governments, companies, as well as endanger the safety of the society. The need for high availability and reliability of these systems is therefore the pillar guiding our research. This paper proposes the adoption of anomaly detection as a method to support self-adaptation in CPPS and to ensure flexibility, reliability, and protection of industrial environments against modern cyber threats. An anomaly detection mechanism can be employed to monitor, and learn the normal behavior of an industrial system, and to generate alerts when the observed events indicate abnormal activities. On this concept we base our work, and we demonstrate how timely identifying critical security events can enable, through the self-adaptation (e.g., triggering automatic configuration changes), an efficient protection of the CPPS against advanced threats, and an effective containment of their effects.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387655","Cyber Physical Production Systems;Self-adaptation;Anomaly Detection;Industry 4.0","Security;Monitoring;Anomaly detection;Measurement;Industries;Sensors;Planning","cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;security of data;self-adjusting systems","anomaly detection mechanism;productivity;IoT;Internet of Things;CPPS self-adaptation;Industry 4.0;cyber physical production systems protection;cloud computing;industrial processes;fourth industrial revolution;financial loss;cyber-threats","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm performs automatic detection of flames and does not require adjusting its parameters. All color and shape features are calculated using integral images allowing changing search windows without increasing processing time drastically. The processing time is kept low via a combination of parallel processing on cores of the central processing unit and graphics processing unit. Detection does not rely on background subtraction; thus, it can resist camera jitter and rotation. The method was tested on a standard fire dataset. Experimental results confirm the reliability of the method and fast processing of 1920×1080 video sequences at 10 fps.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390782","","Image color analysis;Graphics processing units;Cameras;Instruction sets;Fires;Videos;Feature extraction","graphics processing units;image colour analysis;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);microprocessor chips;object detection;parallel processing;shape recognition;video signal processing;video surveillance","AdaBoost;parallel processing;automatic detection;shape features;central processing unit;fire flame detection;surveillance systems;color features;video sequences;graphics processing unit","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is simple enough, but this protocol lacks security mechanisms, and that is one of the main reasons that the entire vehicle is vulnerable for different cyber-physical attacks. Therefore, the detection and counteraction against such attacks on the CAN bus protocol is an important task. In the paper, we present an approach for visual analysis of the CAN bus protocol traffic dumps, which is based on visualization of traffic timeline segments by using radial bar charts. Experiments for visualization of traffic dumps are presented. The advantages of the proposed approach are simplicity and clarity in determining attacks.

In addition, to a change in choices, preferences and behavior of individuals and households in energy demand and consumption, to achieve a successful transition to a more sustainable energy system, the adoption of new metering solutions to foster a wide range of sustainable actions by diverse people across the globe will be required. In this paper, we discuss the development of an ultra-low-power energy meter exploiting a single current transformer (CT) sensor for harvesting energy from the same load under monitoring. Starting from the hypothesis that the node activation rate increases monotonically with the primary load draw, and assuming that the node consumes fixed energy quanta during each activation, it is possible to infer the load power from the interval between activations. With this approach, we can provide a device that lowers maintenance cost related to installation and battery replacement; does not need to deal with high main voltage; and does not introduce any additional energy consumption overhead as it draws zero-power under zero-load condition. Energy budget is guaranteed also thanks to the use of a LoRa radio for data transmission.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390784","","Monitoring;Meters;Current transformers;Capacitors;Batteries;Power demand;Energy consumption","current transformers;electric current measurement;energy consumption;energy harvesting;energy measurement;power meters;reliability;sensors;sustainable development","sustainable energy system;single current transformer sensor;energy consumption;battery-free nonintrusive power meter;energy monitoring;IPCC;Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change;reliability;gas emission reduction;ultralow-power energy meter;node activation rate;CT;energy harvesting;LoRa radio;data transmission","","1","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A very promising way of achieving self-healing is through structural adaptation (SHSA), by replacing a failed component with a substitute component. We present a knowledge base modeling relations among system variables given that certain implicit redundancy exists in the system and show how to extract a substitute from that knowledge base using guided search. The result of our search, i.e., the substitute, is optimal w.r.t. a user-defined utility function considering properties of the system variables (e.g., accuracy). We demonstrate our approach - Self-Healing by Property-Guided Structural Adaptation (SH-PGSA) - by deploying it in a real-world CPS prototype of a rover whose sensors are susceptible to failure.

As a matter of fact, the CPS growing market potential is scarcely supported by tools able to sustain the solid ecosystem required for a relevant market uptake. This issue becomes even more constraining the moment the concept of CPS is extended and aggregated to propose cyber-physical machines and manufacturing systems, where the complexity of the controlling intelligence and of the digital counterpart explodes. This paper aims at describing how the design and implementation of a multi-sided platform (MSP) for CPS deployment within the automation sector can provide the technological background to incentivize their adoption. In fact, the market needs an economic support to accelerate the transition towards new paradigms for the development of the software components of a mechatronic system. Developing an infrastructure on the top of which the CPS value chain can be instantiated and orchestrated, we provide the technical means to incentivize the creation of such an ecosystem able to support SMEs in their transition towards Industry 4.0.","","978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390790","Multi-sided platform;Factory automation;IEC 61499;Digital Twin;Business model for multi-sided platform","Automation;Mechatronics;Industries;Manufacturing;Software;Business;IEC Standards","cyber-physical systems;manufacturing systems;mechatronics;production engineering computing;small-to-medium enterprises","economic support;mechatronic system;CPS value chain;multisided platform;automation market;middle enterprises;manufacturing system;CPS growing market potential;solid ecosystem;cyber-physical machines;MSP","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
