Taking a toll station in Shanghai as a case study, this paper analyzed its queuing situation on the first day of Tomb-sweeping day holiday before and after the toll-free policy with a queuing theory model. How to balance the induced traffic and the limited highway capacity with optimal toll strategies was also discussed. The results show that with total departure traffic volume increasing and an average service time decreasing, the average queue length and congestion duration became longer for the first year after the implementation of the policy. But then queuing situations were improved markedly in later years with increasing percentage of ETC users.

The method relies on the propagation of highly nonlinear solitary waves within a granular medium made of a monoperiodic chain of spherical particles. The hypothesis of the investigation is that, while one end of the chain is in contact with the rail or beam to be probed, a solitary wave is triggered in the chain and the amplitude and speed of the waves reflected at the chain/structure interface is affected by the axial stress. To verify this hypothesis a finite element model of thermally stressed beams was developed and coupled to a discrete finite element model able to predict the propagation of the solitary waves along a L-shaped granular medium. The models were validated experimentally and the results show that the amplitude and the time of flight of the reflected waves are a function of the axial stress. In the future, these findings may be used to develop a new intelligent sensing system to increase the safety or rail transportation.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569937","rail transportation;highly nonlinear solitary waves;buckling;sensing systems;nondestructive evaluation","Stress;Rails;Transducers;Finite element analysis;Temperature measurement;Mathematical model;Thermal stresses","beams (structures);condition monitoring;finite element analysis;mechanical contact;nondestructive testing;rails;railways;thermal stresses","thermally stressed beams;discrete finite element model;solitary wave;granular medium;intelligent sensing system;noninvasive assessment;continuous welded rails;nondestructive evaluation method;monoperiodic chain;nonlinear solitary waves;chain-structure interface;rail transportation","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study investigated a novel classification of mental workload level using NIRS data by the difference of sliding window time in both channel-independent and subject-independent scenarios. Five sliding times from 1 to 5 s were tested for classification of the mental workload level in 60 experiments in the naturalistic condition. The results indicated that the sliding times were not significantly related to the accuracy of classification using NIRS data when the sample size was just enough.

The results demonstrate that calibrated models significantly differ from those of diesel buses. Model testing work demonstrates a good agreement between model estimates and MOVES results. The study also indicates that the optimum fuel economy cruise speed ranges between 40 to 50 km/h with road grade varying from 0% to 8%, which is similar to diesel buses. Sensitivity analysis provides valuable insights that steeper roads and heavier CNG buses result in lower optimum cruise speeds, and that optimum cruise speeds are more sensitive to vehicle weight at higher grade levels.

To simulate the interaction between the CAVs and the cut-in vehicles controlled by human drivers near the intersection, a lane changing model is proposed to emulate the politeness and patience characteristics of the human driver. The proposed lane changing model is then calibrated based on over 100,000 naturalistic lane changing events collected by the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program. A case study on simulation of the cut-in scenario is carried out to demonstrate the human driver's lane changing sensitivity under different driving trajectories of a frontal CAV and the influence on the energy consumption of the CAV due to the cut-in vehicle is evaluated. The simulation results indicate that the fuel economy of the CAV can be substantially improved if its surrounding cut-in vehicles can be well handled.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569705","","Vehicles;Acceleration;Trajectory;Databases;Fuel economy;Safety;Data models","energy conservation;energy consumption;fuel economy;road traffic;road vehicles","energy efficiency;mixed traffic;human controlled vehicles;cut-in vehicle;lane changing model;Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program;frontal CAV;energy consumption;Connected and Automated Vehicles;adaptive cruise control","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, the automated driving functions need to be assessed with respect to human driving performance according to the guidelines defined by the German Ethics Commission for Automated and Connected Driving [1]. Thus, based on a methodology for safety performance assessment of automated driving functions, this paper introduces specific driver models for modelling of human driver performance.

It is expensive to test autonomous vehicles in the field, and therefore virtual testing methods are needed. Generative models of maneuvers such as cut-ins, overtakes, and lane-keeping are needed to thoroughly test the autonomous vehicle in a virtual environment. To train such models we need ground truth maneuver labels and obtaining such labels can be time-consuming and costly. In this work, we use a mixture of hidden Markov models to find clusters in maneuver trajectories, which can be used to speed up the labeling process. The maneuver trajectories are noisy, asynchronous and of uneven length, which make hidden Markov models a good fit for the data. The method is evaluated on labeled data from a test track consisting of cut-ins and overtakes with favorable results. Further, it is applied to natural data where many of the clusters found can be interpreted as driver maneuvers under reasonable assumptions. We show that mixtures of hidden Markov models can be used to find motion patterns in driver maneuver data from highways and country roads.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569418","","Hidden Markov models;Trajectory;Roads;Tracking;Clustering methods;Autonomous vehicles","driver information systems;hidden Markov models;mobile robots;pattern clustering;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;roads","vehicle maneuver trajectories;hidden Markov models;autonomous vehicle;virtual testing methods;generative models;driver maneuver data;asynchronous;cut-ins;clusters;motion patterns;highways;country roads;safety;lane-keeping","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, the exploitation of functional redundancies must be well argued if employed in a safety concept as physical limits can be reached. In this paper, we want to examine from a trajectory tracking perspective whether such a concept can be used. For this, we present a model predictive fault-tolerant trajectory tracking approach for over-actuated vehicles featuring wheel individual all-wheel drive, brakes, and steering. Applying this approach exemplarily demonstrates for a selected reference trajectory that degradations such as missing or undesired wheel torques as well as reduced steering dynamics can be compensated. Degradations at the physical actuator limits lead to significant deviations from the reference trajectory while small constant steering angles are partially critical.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569243","","Wheels;Actuators;Predictive models;Vehicle dynamics;Trajectory;Degradation;Trajectory tracking","actuators;fault tolerance;position control;predictive control;road vehicles;steering systems;torque;vehicle dynamics;wheels","functional redundancies;trajectory tracking perspective;entire vehicle automation functionality;safety requirements;safety concept;model predictive fault-tolerant trajectory;over-actuated vehicles;selected reference trajectory;physical actuator limits;vehicle automation;model predictive fault-tolerant trajectory tracking approach;undesired wheel torques","","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study investigated contributing factors to users' vehicles selection behavior through random forests and binary logistic regression using the administrative datasets collected from EVCARD carsharing program. Results showed state of charge (SOC) of electric vehicles and the number of available vehicles parked at a station had the greatest effect on user's vehicles selection behavior. Users tend to be greedy rather than rational when making decisions as they always choose the vehicles with the maximum SOC even their real trips are short.

We propose a novel two-stream architecture for joint learning of object detection and motion segmentation. We designed three different flavors of our network to establish systematic comparison. It is shown that the joint training of tasks significantly improves accuracy compared to training them independently. Although motion segmentation has relatively fewer data than vehicle detection. The shared fusion encoder benefits from the joint training to learn a generalized representation. We created our own publicly available dataset (KITTI MOD) by extending KITTI object detection to obtain static/moving annotations on the vehicles. We compared against MPNet as a baseline, which is the current state of the art for CNN-based motion detection. It is shown that the proposed two-stream architecture improves the mAP score by 21.5% in KITTI MOD.

We use a fully convolutional residual network together with a feature pyramid network in order to achieve both semantic segmentation and Mask R-CNN based instance level recognition. We introduce a novel heuristic fusion approach for panoptic segmentation. The instance and semantic segmentation output of the network is fused into a panoptic segmentation.

One potential direction to solve this problem is to provide a balanced objective function to achieve desired mobility with minimized energy consumption. This research developed a reinforcement learning (RL) based control with reward functions considering energy and mobility in a joint manner-a penalty function is introduced for number of stops. Further, we proposed a clustering-based technique to make the state-space finite which is critical for a tractable implementation of the RL algorithm. We implemented the algorithm in a calibrated NG-SIM network within a traffic micro-simulator-PTV VISSIM. With sole focus on energy, we report 47% reduction in energy consumption when compared with existing signal control schemes, however causing a 65.6% increase in system travel time. In contrast, the control strategy focusing on energy minimization with penalty for stops yields 6.7% reduction in energy consumption with 27% increase in system travel time. The developed RL algorithm with a flexible penalty function in the reward will achieve desired energy goals for a network of signalized intersections without compromising on the mobility performance.

This metric can be estimated by averaging the daily bicyclist's volume measured throughout the year with a long-term automated counter. As continuous data for a whole year at many sites may not be available, a common practice is to collect short-term count data for a sample of locations and then apply an extrapolation method to convert short-term count data to yearly count data. To perform extrapolation, each short-term counter must be matched to one or more long-term counters with similar demand patterns. The matching procedure can significantly impact the accuracy of AADB estimation. This study proposes a matching approach based on a cluster analysis approach, Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), and a supervised learning approach, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). It was found that the proposed approach using a combination of certain variables such as land use and a traffic distribution index resulted in low AADB estimation error rates, which enhanced existing approaches.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569815","extrapolation;AADB;cluster analysis;supervised learning","Extrapolation;Estimation;Bicycles;Meteorology;Data collection;Indexes;Volume measurement","estimation theory;extrapolation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;road traffic;statistical analysis;traffic engineering computing;transportation","average annual daily bicyclist volume;nonmotorized transportation studies;exposure modeling;long-term automated counter;continuous data;short-term count data;yearly count data;short-term counter;long-term counters;matching procedure;matching approach;low AADB estimation error rates;long-term data collection sites;cluster analysis approach;partitioning around medoids;PAM;supervised learning approach;k-nearest neighbor;KNN;traffic distribution index","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike passive environments, pedestrians are active agents having their own utilities and decisions, which must be inferred and predicted by AVs in order to control interactions with them and navigation around them. In particular, when a pedestrian wishes to cross the road in front of the vehicle at an unmarked crossing, the pedestrian and AV must compete for the space, which may be considered as a game-theoretic interaction in which one agent must yield to the other. To inform AV controllers in this setting, this study collects and analyses data from real-world human road crossings to determine what features of crossing behaviours are predictive about the level of assertiveness of pedestrians and of the eventual winner of the interactions. It presents the largest and most detailed data set of its kind known to us, and new methods to analyze and predict pedestrian-vehicle interactions based upon it. Pedestrian-vehicle interactions are decomposed into sequences of independent discrete events. We use probabilistic methods - logistic regression and decision tree regression - and sequence analysis to analyze sets and sub-sequences of actions used by both pedestrians and human drivers while crossing at an intersection, to find common patterns of behaviour and to predict the winner of each interaction. We report on the particular features found to be predictive and which can thus be integrated into game-theoretic AV controllers to inform real-time interactions.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569282","Human Factors;Agent-Human Interactions;Autonomous Vehicles","Roads;Autonomous vehicles;Solid modeling;Observers;Regression tree analysis;Sequences","decision trees;game theory;human factors;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;pedestrians;probability;regression analysis;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles","game-theoretic AV controllers;real-time interactions;pedestrian road-crossing assertiveness;autonomous vehicle control;autonomous vehicles;road users;unmarked crossing;game-theoretic interaction;real-world human road crossings;crossing behaviours;pedestrian-vehicle interactions;probabilistic methods;logistic regression;decision tree regression","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies have established that driver's emotions play an important role in driving behavior. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the driver's emotions and requisite warning to the driver will help in maintaining safety on the roads. In our framework, at regular intervals, we detect the driver's face in the current frame and recognize the driver's emotions. For expression recognition, we extract features from the face image using two standard pre-trained deep neural networks, AlexNet and VGG16, that we fine-tune on facial expression data. We extract the features from the fully connected layer from these two networks for each frame and concatenate the two feature vectors to form a single feature vector. The novelty of our framework lies in creating distinct subspaces of each expression, using these feature vectors and applying Grassmann graph embedding based discriminant analysis to recognize the expression. The subspaces accommodate the variations in multiple instances of an expression of the same person as well as across multiple people.

However, these methods are very inefficient when the input image size is large, such as pavement images (2000×4000-pixel) used for cracking detection. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by introducing a fully convolutional dense-dilation network and the corresponding training strategy. The network is trained with small image blocks, then works on full-size images, which only needs to forward once for the process. In the first phase, it trains a classification network which classifies a small image block as crack, sealed crack or background. In the second phase, the fully convolutional layer is employed to convert the classification network into a detection network that is insensitive to the input size. At last, via introducing the equivalent dense-dilation design, it transfers both the low-level and middle-level knowledge from the classification network to facilitate the end-to-end network refining and improve the crack localization accuracy. The proposed approach is validated on 600 pavement images (2000×4000-pixel) obtained by industry equipment and it achieves state-of-the-art performance comparing with that of the recently published works in efficiency and accuracy.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569958","","Training;Feature extraction;Convolution;Neurons;Image resolution;Knowledge engineering;Kernel","convolution;crack detection;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;roads;structural engineering computing","classification network;end-to-end network refining;object detection;deep convolutional neural networks;crack localization;pavement images;pavement crack detection;window-sliding based methods;region-proposal based methods;fully convolutional dense-dilation network;deep convolutional neural network","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The macroscopic traffic dynamics are governed by Aw-Rascle-Zhang(ARZ) model, consisting of second-order nonlinear partial differential equations(PDEs). The linear stability of uniform density and velocity of the ARZ model with relaxation term is discussed. Under certain densities in congested regime, small perturbations from the equilibrium transport upstream of traffic and grow into instabilities. To stabilize the inhomogeneous ARZ model around the uniform steady states, a boundary control input through VSL at outlet is considered. Using spatial transformation and backstepping method, we design a full-state feedback control law. By taking boundary measurement of density variation at the outlet, a collocated boundary observer is designed to estimate states on freeway segment. Therefore, we obtain the output feedback controller by combining the full state feedback control and collocated boundary observer. The exponential stability in L<sub>2</sub> sense and finite time convergence to equilibrium are achieved with boundary control law and boundary observer.

When using a color lookup table for an image segmentation-based object detector, the process of creating the lookup table is the crucial point. In this paper, we propose a method for generating a lookup table using real world data of a large dataset. The training data is sampled from labeled objects and stored as multisets. We contribute a frequency-based filtering method to clean the samples before using a k-nearest neighbor classifier to generalize. The result is stored as a three dimensional lookup table.

Such information could be used to choose different transport modes for a route, to avoid the use of hired private vehicles (HPV), like taxis, in certain segments of the trip with poor traffic conditions, for example. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of hybrid Hired Private Vehicles and Transit (HPV-transit) to enable a more personalized urban routing. User's impressions over trips' cost and duration are taken into account to select better hybrid routes. A taxi dataset was used to create graphs that map the main mobility flows in New York City. To create these graphs we propose a novel flow-based clustering technique which identifies trending mobility flows based on spatio-temporal datasets containing departures and arrivals. These flows are used to evaluate the performance of the hybrid HPV-transit. We compare the proposed solution with traditional transit or HPV only trips. It is possible to conclude that the adoption of HPV-transit trips can bring benefits in terms of cost and duration for urban mobility.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8570008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8570008","","Urban areas;Public transportation;Routing;Clustering algorithms;Market research;Spatial databases","graph theory;pattern clustering;road traffic;traffic information systems;ubiquitous computing;vehicle routing","graphs;spatio-temporal datasets;hybrid HPV-transit;HPV-transit trips;urban mobility;hybrid context-aware multimodal routing;urban multimodal transport networks;user preferences;contextual information;poor traffic conditions;hybrid routes;taxi dataset;flow-based clustering technique;transport modes;hybrid hired private vehicles and transit;urban routing","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Enhancing the road network operation quality is an effective way to alleviate congestion. The evaluation of urban road network operation quality is different from the congestion evaluation; it is a method for measuring the controllability of urban road network with increasing traffic demand pressure. Based on the two-fluid model of urban macroscopic traffic flow theory, two indicators including the Traffic Smoothness Index (TSI) and the Network Adaptability Index (NAI) were established to describe the urban road network operation quality. The model of large-scale high-frequency trajectory data processing to calculate the operation quality evaluation indicators was proposed. Then, two China cities of Beijing and Shanghai were taken as examples to analyze the operation quality of urban road network. The results show that the quality of the road network operation in Shanghai is better than that of Beijing. The degree of smoothness of the two cities' road network gradually improves from the downtown area to the border of urban area, but the road network in downtown areas have higher adaptability in both cities. The study is of great significance to improve the operation quality of urban road network and the service level of traffic system.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569750","Urban Road Network;Operation Quality;High-frequency Trajectory Data;Two-fluid Model","Roads;Trajectory;Indexes;Urban areas;Adaptation models;Data models;Traffic congestion","data handling;road traffic;traffic control","urban traffic congestion;congestion evaluation;urban macroscopic traffic flow theory;large-scale high-frequency trajectory data processing;operation quality evaluation indicators;cities;urban area;sustainable urban development;network adaptability index;urban road network operation quality evaluation method;NAI;TSI;traffic smoothness index","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to reduce the traffic accident due to driver distraction, in this work, a monitoring system is developed using physiological, behavioral and vehicle signal. Motion signal (accelerometer and gyroscope), electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response and CAN-Bus signal were collected during the on-road driving session undertaken by 8 participants. Features were extracted from these signals. Feature space from each signal was evaluated independently to identify driver distraction. To improve the recognition accuracy the multimodal feature space was fused and evaluated. Since the high dimension of fused feature space suffers from the curse of dimensionality, feature selection techniques were applied to obtain optimal multi-modal feature space. An average accuracy of 99.85% was obtained when multimodal feature space was generalized using ensemble bagged classifier. An average accuracy of 99.1% was obtained when the multimodal feature space was reduced to 10-D space using the Relieff feature selection technique and generalized using ensemble bagged classifier.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569893","Distracted driving;multi-modal detection system;physiological signal;feature selection;Predictive modeling","Feature extraction;Entropy;Vehicles;Electrocardiography;Fractals;Neuroscience;Accidents","driver information systems;feature selection;image classification","multimodal system;on-the-road driver distraction;traffic accident;monitoring system;galvanic skin response;CAN-Bus signal;on-road driving session;optimal multimodal feature space;Relieff feature selection technique;fused feature space;ensemble bagged classifier;electrocardiogram;motion signal","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, we replace the original stochastic problem with a Sample Average Approximation, and provide its performance guarantees. Second, we divide the controller into two submodules. The first submodule assigns vehicles to existing customers and the second redistributes vacant vehicles throughout the city. This enables the problem to be solved as two totally unimodular linear programs, allowing the controller to scale to large problem sizes. Finally, we test the proposed algorithm in two scenarios based on real data and show that it outperforms prior state-of-the-art algorithms.

The automation level for these systems are getting higher over years and automated driving is expected to be launched in near future. Advantage of those systems is not only for safety, but also for reducing the workload in driving. Especially the system which allows drivers to leave their hands off the steering wheel is considered to provide additional benefits to drivers compared to the system requiring hands on the steering wheel or to manual driving. The one of the additional benefits is the mental workload reduction, in other words stress level reduction, by free of their hands in driving. In this paper, we propose the method to measure mental workload which allows quantitative comparison in stress level between hands off and hands on the steering wheel system including manual driving, taking individual initial stress level and temporal change of stress level in a day into account. The proposed method is relatively easier on the measurement procedure and not requires complex measurement tools. In this sense, it fits to evaluate ADAS systems with actual driving.

To preserve the information we decided to treat it as two-dimensional signals (images), so we based our estimation algorithm on image analysis, preserving data veracity until the last steps (instead of first matching curves that induce a first approximation). Then we use image classification and filtering tools for merging of main features and scaling.

However, due to the complexities of this phenomenon, accurate and yet simple models of such lane change maneuvers are hard to develop. In this work, we present a macroscopic model for predicting the number of vehicles that bypass at a traffic diverge. We take into account the selfishness of vehicles in selecting their lanes; every vehicle selects lanes such that its own cost is minimized. We discuss how we model the costs that are experienced by vehicles. Then, taking into account the selfish behavior of vehicles, we model the lane choice of vehicles at a traffic diverge as a Wardrop equilibrium. We state and prove the properties of Wardrop equilibrium in our model. We show that there always exists an equilibrium for our model. Moreover, unlike most nonlinear asymmetrical routing games, we prove that the equilibrium is unique under mild assumptions. We discuss how our model can be easily calibrated by running a simple optimization problem. Using our calibrated model, we validate it through simulation studies and demonstrate that our model successfully predicts the aggregate lane change maneuvers that are performed by vehicles for bypassing at a traffic diverge.

To also handle situations of more dynamic urban traffic, including vehicles that may be slowing down or stopping, we have now extended our previous approach by a dynamic vehicle model.

Moreover, reactive predictions are necessary in highly interactive driving scenarios to answer “what if I take this action in the future” for autonomous vehicles. Many recently proposed methods based on probabilistic graphical models (PGM), neural networks (NN) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) have great potential to solve the problem. However, there is no existing unified framework to homogenize the problem formulation, representation simplification, and evaluation metric for those methods. In this paper, we formulate a probabilistic reaction prediction problem, and reveal the relationship between reaction and situation prediction problems. We employ prototype trajectories with designated motion patterns other than “intention” to homogenize the representation so that probabilities corresponding to each trajectory generated by different methods can be evaluated. We also discuss the reasons why “intention” is not suitable to serve as a motion indicator in highly interactive scenarios. We propose to use Brier score as the baseline metric for evaluation. In order to reveal the fatality of the consequences when the predictions are adopted by decision-making and planning, we propose a fatality-aware metric, which is a weighted Brier score based on the criticality of the trajectory pairs of the interacting entities. Conservatism and non-defensiveness are defined from the weighted Brier score to indicate the consequences caused by inaccurate predictions. Modified methods based on PGM, NN and IRL are provided to generate probabilistic reaction predictions in an exemplar scenario of nudging from a highway ramp. The results are evaluated by the baseline and proposed metrics to construct a mini benchmark. Analysis on the properties of each method is also provided by comparing the baseline and proposed metric scores.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569785","","Probabilistic logic;Trajectory;Measurement;Merging;Autonomous vehicles;Prediction algorithms;Hidden Markov models","decision making;driver information systems;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;probability;road vehicles","fatality-aware benchmark;highly interactive driving scenarios;high-quality decision-making;motion planning;autonomous vehicles;probabilistic graphical models;inverse reinforcement learning;weighted Brier score;probabilistic reaction prediction;PGM;neural networks;NN;IRL","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we develop a physically intuitive approach to traffic prediction that captures the time-varying spatio-temporal correlation between traffic at different measurement points. The spatio-temporal correlation is affected by the road network topology, time-varying speed, and time-varying trip distribution. Distinctly different from previous black-box approaches to road traffic modeling and prediction, parameters of the proposed approach have physically intuitive meanings which make them readily amenable to suit changing road and traffic conditions. Second, unlike some existing techniques which capture the variation of spatio-temporal correlation by a complete redesign and calibration of the model, the proposed approach uses a unified model which incorporates the physical factors potentially affecting the variation of spatio-temporal correlation into a series of parameters. These parameters are relatively easy to control and adjust when road and traffic conditions change, thereby greatly reducing the computational complexity. Experiments using two set of real traffic traces demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior accuracy compared with the widely used ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and is only marginally inferior to that obtained by constructing multiple STARIMA models for different time of the day, however with a much reduced computational and implementation complexity.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569964","","Correlation;Roads;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Data models;Detectors;Traffic control","autoregressive moving average processes;computational complexity;forecasting theory;network topology;road traffic;spatiotemporal phenomena","road traffic modeling;traffic traces;unified STARIMA based model;short-term traffic flow prediction;unified spatio-temporal model;Space-Time AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average;short-term road traffic prediction;time-varying spatio-temporal correlation;road network topology;time-varying speed;time-varying trip distribution;black-box approaches;implementation complexity;computational complexity","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The gaze angle of the driver is not deterministically related to his/her head pose due to the interplay between head and eye movements. Therefore, this study aims to establish a probabilistic relationship using deep learning. While probabilistic regression techniques such as Gaussian process regression (GPR) has been previously used to predict the visual attention of a driver, the proposed deep learning framework is a more generic approach that does not make assumptions, learning the relationship between gaze and head pose from the data. In our formulation, the continuous gaze angles are converted into intervals and the grid of the quantized angles is treated as an image for dense prediction. We rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with upsampling to map the six degrees of freedom of the orientation and position of the head into gaze angles. We train and evaluate the proposed network with data collected from drivers who were asked to look at predetermined locations inside a car during naturalistic driving recordings. The proposed model obtains very promising results, where the size of the gaze region with 95% accuracy is only 11.73% of a half sphere centered at the driver, which approximates his/her field of view. The architecture offers an appealing and general solution to convert regression problems into dense classification problems.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569709","","Vehicles;Head;Visualization;Task analysis;Training;Probabilistic logic","convolution;driver information systems;feedforward neural nets;Gaussian processes;gaze tracking;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis","probabilistic estimation;gaze region;visual attention;probabilistic relationship;probabilistic regression techniques;Gaussian process regression;deep learning framework;continuous gaze angles;driver intent;dense classification;smart vehicles;driver behaviour;convolutional neural networks","","1","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This significantly increases the robustness of the segmentation process. It allows a point-wise clustering even at challenging distances and viewing angles as well as occlusions. For the sake of speed, the clustering pipeline is separated into vertical and horizontal clustering. Therefore, we split the graph into multiple vertical and horizontal line graphs which are processed in parallel.

One of the most important research questions in the field of naturalistic driving study (NDS) is how the results obtained from the NDS for a specific temporal and geographical location can be transferred to other locations without introducing a bias related to the inter-driver and intra-driver heterogeneity. Hence, this study utilized a high-resolution data obtained from the SHRP2 NDS to develop a framework for capturing inherent effects of driver-behavioral factors on driver behavior and performance. The data collected from 144 drivers 16-84 years old in New York, equivalent to 200 hours and 19,200 km of driving, to examine the effectiveness of the developed method. In order to control for spatial and temporal effects, a methodology was developed in a way that similar observations, in case of spatial and temporal characteristics, were categorized and analyzed together. The results revealed that there was less intra-driver variability in speeding, lane keeping, and acceleration/deceleration behaviors when taking into account spatial and temporal characteristics, which shows the effectiveness of the developed methods to increase the transferability of the NDS results worldwide.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569927","","Vehicles;Meteorology;Computer crashes;Bridges;Acceleration;Safety;Indexes","behavioural sciences computing;data analysis;human factors;risk analysis;road safety;road traffic","SHRP2 NDS;driver-behavioral factors;SHRP2 naturalistic driving study;spatial-temporal factors;roadway environment;driver performance;high-resolution data;driver behavior heterogeneity;New York","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a driving advisory system for vehicles approaching traffic lights that is based on the use of a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system and evaluates its impact on traffic flow characteristics. This system, which assumes the existence of a connection with the traffic light ahead, calculates the distance required to pass through the intersection without stopping during the remaining green signal time. The required distance is then projected onto the road surface as a green planar rectangle shape through a head-up display (HUD). As long as the vehicle is traveling on the green rectangle, the drivers will not need to make a complete stop or accelerate again in order to meet the onset of a green signal. Assuming that all vehicles are equipped with our proposed system, traffic simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of the scheme. Numerical analyses showed that a higher fuel efficiency and lower carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions were achievable, even under high-density traffic conditions, by combining the full and partial assistance levels of our proposed system.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569394","","Vehicles;Acceleration;Green products;Air pollution;Resistance;Fuels;Roads","road traffic control","green light optimal speed advisory system;green signal time;high-density traffic conditions;traffic simulations;green planar rectangle shape;traffic flow characteristics;traffic light;driving advisory system;traffic more energy efficient;appropriate driver behavior patterns;autonomous vehicles;vehicle-to-infrastructure;vehicle-to-vehicle;high-density traffic flowe","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Adding further complexity is the increasingly important role of artificial intelligence and rapidly changing technologies and business models. We propose a modeling framework, CognAgent, which unifies the modeling approach of different types of autonomous entities from the perspective of cognition rather than revealed behaviors. This approach improves model flexibility, interpretability, and computational efficiency. Heterogeneous agents inherit from a single blueprint agent and interact with one another within the Physical Interaction module, the output of which is fed into the module of Space of Observables for agents to sense and perceive through noisy media of information transmission. Combining with prior knowledge, preprogrammed routines, emotions, and habits, agents make decisions on how to act in the Physical Interaction module. In CognAgent, information is a result of the change of perceived uncertainty, and therefore, consistent with the Information Theory. Owing to this explicitness of agents' cognition, the derived models become extendable to new technology and business models. Equity analysis related to cognitive limitations such as vision and hearing loss becomes also natural. The numerical example models explicitly humans and autonomous vehicles with heterogeneous information transmission, perception, and risk preference.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569322","","Transportation;Computational modeling;Cognition;Analytical models;Sensors;Radar;Artificial intelligence","cognition;decision making;multi-agent systems;traffic information systems;transportation","heterogeneous information transmission;cognitive framework;unifying human;artificial intelligence;transportation systems modeling;business models;modeling framework;CognAgent;modeling approach;autonomous entities;model flexibility;heterogeneous agents;single blueprint agent;derived models;cognitive limitations;physical interaction module","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, a number of ITS applications have also been developed to reduce environmental impacts from greenhouse gases and pollutant emissions. Typical eco-friendly ITS applications (e.g., eco-routing) focus on reducing overall vehicle emissions. However, pollutant emissions from vehicles would cause more adverse impacts on public health where there are more population living closer to the emission sources (i.e., roadways). To date, eco-friendly ITS applications have not been developed from a pollutant exposure point of view. In this paper, we introduce a new vehicle routing method that goes beyond minimizing overall pollutant emissions; instead, we aim to minimize pollutant exposure to the localized population along the roadways. As part of the method, the human inhaled mass of pollutants is modeled and used as part of the routing cost. Modeling results show that the inhaled mass of fine particulate matter for the selected susceptible population can be reduced by approximately 30% - 80% on a typical workday with the implementation of the proposed vehicle routing method.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569501","route plan;mobile-source;emission;pollution;exposure","Atmospheric modeling;Vehicle routing;Routing;Roads;Sociology;Statistics;Dispersion","aerosols;air pollution;atmospheric techniques;road traffic;vehicle routing","human exposure;traffic-related air pollutants;Intelligent Transportation System;traffic safety;pollutant emissions;typical eco-friendly ITS applications;eco-routing;vehicle emissions;emission sources;vehicle routing method;human inhaled mass;routing cost;ITS technology;fine particulate matter","","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simultaneously, an effective wireless network resources allocation scheme is one of the essential and fundamental factors for the QoS (quality of Service) on the VECC.

Cross-season localization, in which query and database images involve different seasons is one of the most challenging task scenarios, owing to appearance variations among seasons. Because of recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNs) and transfer learning techniques, the task can be solved accurately by training and fine-tuning a DCN-based visual place classifier. However, the direct implementation of this would require collecting and storing a large amount of visual experiences (i.e., training data) for every new season, which is impractical. The goal of our study is to suppress the space cost for long-term memory and to develop a constant cost framework for long-term global localization. Moreover, we formulate and consider the task of experience compression as a scheduling problem of how to choose the part of the previous season's experience that is to be replaced with the current season's experience, to achieve an optimal tradeoff between localization accuracy and training efficiency.

We demonstrate and evaluate the communication protocol and the maneuver planning method on cooperative lane changing scenarios with a physical automated vehicle as well as in a real time simulation.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569791","","Planning;Trajectory;Merging;Safety;Hidden Markov models;Protocols;Bicycles","convex programming;feedforward;linearisation techniques;path planning;protocols;quadratic programming;road traffic control;road vehicles;trajectory control","cooperative automated vehicles;lane changing maneuver planning method;application level cooperation protocol;space time reservations;longitudinal movement directions;lateral movement directions;convex quadratic programming problems;communication protocol;physical automated vehicle;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;lane following maneuver planning method;input-output linearization;full state reference trajectory;feed-forward controls","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this framework, a vehicle is allowed to enter a region only if it is anticipated that the region will not exceed its critical capacity during the time-interval that the vehicle will require to traverse an urban region. When a vehicle is about to start its journey, it informs a road side unit (RSU) about its origin and destination. Then the RSU responds with the starting time and the path to be followed by the vehicle. The given starting time manages each region's inflow while the given path avoids regions that are expected to be at capacity when the vehicle is expected to traverse the particular region. In this paper, the route-reservation problem is formulated and heuristic solutions are proposed to solve it in an online fashion.

For the purposes of realizing the advantages of future AVs and SAVs, a better understanding of future costs of travel is necessary. The goal of this research work is to estimate future travel costs using each of the AV and SAV Systems. These cost estimates would be crucial in evaluating the impacts of these technologies on future mobility and society. For this purpose, extensive literature reviews were conducted and a model was developed to analyze and evaluate the future travel costs using each of the AV and SAV systems. Results of this work indicate that future travel costs using SAV systems are likely to be substantially lower than those of using AV systems.

These models provide methods to gather application specific security requirements based on identified threat and item combinations that need to be coped with. However, a standardized mapping between security levels and required mandatory security mechanisms and design rules is currently missing. We address this problem first by suggesting that the risk assessment process should result in five security levels, similar to the functional safety standard ISO 26262. Second, we identify suitable security mechanisms and design rules for automotive system design and associate them with appropriate security levels.

For detailed high-precision maps, needed for HAD tasks such as localization, the issue of outdated maps has not been examined yet. To estimate its extent, we reason why some road changes matter more than others and use this distinction to analyze almost 80 km of German highways for changes that render a map outdated. Our evaluation reveals almost 200 major road changes, outdating the maps of more than 32 km (41 %). Observed changes include renewals of lane markings, guardrails and whole road surfaces as well as complete reconstructions. Further on, to facilitate the research of map validation concepts, we publish a dataset consisting of major map features of the more than 80 km of German highways which we examined for changes.

Recent successes suggest that deep neural networks will be widely used in self-driving cars, but current public datasets do not provide sufficient amount of labels for training such large deep neural networks. In this paper, we developed a two-step computational method that can detect traffic lights from images in a real-time manner. The first step exploits a deep neural object detection architecture to fine true traffic light candidates. In the second step, a point-based reward system is used to eliminate false traffic lights out of the candidates. To evaluate the proposed approach, we collected a human-annotated large-scale traffic lights dataset (over 60 hours).

Despite uncertainty these technologies are expected to bring about numerous societal benefits, such as enhanced traffic safety, improved mobility and reduced fuel emissions. In this paper, we propose a novel bottom-up approach to model various SAE levels on VISSIM in a two lane highway environment featuring an on-ramp. Our results indicate that mobility in SAE level 1 always exceeds that of SAE level 0, because the former has a consistently higher acceleration for given conditions. SAE level 2 provides more lateral stability and therefore less implied accidents than level 1 or 0 due to lower lateral deviations. For level 3, key consideration is to model the transition between human and system control. In SAE level 4 we model the operation of autonomous vehicles in Operational Design Domain (ODD) and transition to minimal risk conditions outside ODD. SAE level 5 overcomes impact of these transitions and hence has a better mobility than lower SAE levels. The models can help policymakers to understand the impact of autonomous vehicles on mobility and guide them in making critical policy decisions.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569933","SAE level;Advanced Driver Assistance Systems;Autonomous Driving;Autonomous Vehicles","Acceleration;Computational modeling;Autonomous vehicles;Automation;Automobiles;Time series analysis","mobility management (mobile radio);traffic engineering computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","mobility impacts;autonomous vehicle systems;automated vehicle technologies;enhanced traffic safety;critical policy decisions;ODD;operational design domain;lateral stability;two lane highway environment;VISSIM;SAE level 5","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We highlight the ways pedestrians communicate and use a logistic regression model to identify what factors influence communication patterns of pedestrians and how. We also discuss practical challenges regarding the recognizing and understanding of pedestrians' intention and how our theoretical findings can help to solve them. Our analysis suggests that pedestrians predominantly rely on implicit communication cues such as stepping onto the road to transmit their intention of crossing.

To that end, the state of the art G<sup>1</sup>and G<sup>2</sup> continuous steering functions, namely Dubins, Reeds-Shepp, Hybrid Curvature, and Continuous Curvature Steer, are extended to belief space, where an expected vehicle state is augmented by its associated uncertainty. The so-called beliefs are obtained by propagating a Gaussian probability distribution along the nominal path of the steering function while taking into account the control and localization uncertainty. A novel concept for collision avoidance in Gaussian belief space is then introduced that considers the shape of the vehicle and the full information about the uncertainty of a state.

The distribution of macroscopic properties can be obtained through either direct analysis or event-driven simulation. They are more efficient than conventional (time-driven) traffic simulation, and capture more microscopic details compared to conventional macroscopic flow models. We illustrate the efficiency of this method by delay analyses under two different policies at a two-lane intersection.

While it is difficult enough to choose a proper maneuver for oneself in the limited time, most of all, it remains unknown how the opponent will react. Thus, an optimal decision can only exist as a probabilistic quantity. One way to estimate the latter is to evaluate a large number of driver actions. With the number of notable combinations easily reaching the mark of thousands of crash constellations, even the most powerful PCs take minutes, hours or even days to finish simulations such as the highly accurate Finite Element Method (FEM). Too long for a decision making only milliseconds ahead of the collision. In this paper, a real-time capable approach with two parallel paths is proposed. Path A consists of a machine learning component that is trained with FEM-data, enabling the prediction of even complex crash severity measures in less than one millisecond. Path B contains a 2D mass-spring-damper model for estimating the crash forces and accelerations and thus, acting as a fall-back and plausibilization layer for the machine learning. A FEM-database of car-to-car collisions is used to train the machine learning model and tune the parameters of the 2D mass-spring-damper model.

Fifty-two participants experienced two takeover situations with varying criticality (3 s or 7 s time budget). A low urgent, auditory-tactile TOR was presented to half of the participants. The other half experienced a highly urgent, auditory-tactile TOR. This resulted in two conditions, in which the TOR-urgency and the situational criticality matched, e.g. urgent TOR and highly critical situation, and in two conditions, in which the TOR-urgency and the situational criticality did not match. Results indicate that a TOR-urgency that matches the criticality of the driving situation does not benefit drivers.

This is especially feasible in a tracker that operates in a prediction-update cycle. Tracking predictions can steer object detection towards regions where an object is anticipated and, in turn, tracking updates can be improved by incorporating reinforced detections. In this paper we propose a novel detector-tracker feedback loop for information exchange based on spatio-temporal similarity of detections and tracklets. We reinforce pedestrian detections that have weak confidence scores by matching their bounding boxes to estimated tracklets with high tracking confidence. The proposed system has several compelling advantages: based on a positive feedback principle it extracts the maximum detection and tracking information, while operating transparently and with minimal computational load. In a controlled ablation study we evaluate our feedback mechanism using the KITTI object tracking dataset.

Moreover, the data distribution may change gradually. A typical adaptation strategy is periodically re-tuning the model hyperparameters, at the cost of computational burden. In this work, we present an efficient and principled online hyperparameter learning algorithm for kernel-based traffic prediction models. In tests with real traffic measurement data, our approach requires as little as one-seventh of the computation time of other tuning methods, while achieving better or similar prediction accuracy.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569972","","Kernel;Computational modeling;Tuning;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training;Adaptation models","learning (artificial intelligence);traffic engineering computing","machine learning;online hyperparameter learning;traffic measurement data;kernel-based traffic prediction models;data distribution;traffic measurements;traffic flow prediction models","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, large-scale monitoring in urban network is still a challenging task due to insufficient data. To address this challenge, this study proposes combined use of two emerging data sources: small satellites and connected vehicles (CVs). Small satellites' remote sensing provides spatial distribution of all the vehicles in wide area with certain time interval, such as a few hours. CVs' mobile sensing provides time-contentious trajectories of randomly sampled vehicles, such as several percents of penetration rate. Although each of them in itself is insufficient to estimate traffic state due to long time interval or low penetration rate, combination of these two data could be used to estimate time-continuous traffic state in wide area by complementing limitations of each other. Following this idea, a novel network traffic state estimation method is formulated. The notable feature of the proposed method is that it does not require any roadside detectors or calibrated fundamental diagram parameters, making the method applicable to any surface roads without costly sensor infrastructure. The accuracy of the proposed method was verified by conducting numerical simulation, and promising results were obtained.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569538","","Remote sensing;Small satellites;Roads;Monitoring;Detectors;Trajectory","calibration;remote sensing;state estimation;traffic engineering computing","small satellites;connected vehicles;spatial distribution;time-contentious trajectories;randomly sampled vehicles;long time interval;low penetration rate;time-continuous traffic state;surface roads;large-scale traffic monitoring;road network;traffic flow monitoring;intelligent transportation systems;large-scale monitoring;urban network;insufficient data;emerging data sources;network traffic state estimation method;CV mobile sensing","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, considering the characteristics of the V-ASC evaluation, it is possible to evaluate the accuracy of not only the prediction result of the steering value of each frame but also the autonomous driving result after the continuous frame change. We implemented a software-in-the-loop simulator (S-ILS) that provides a view-transformed image frame corresponding to the steering value change based on the actual vehicle's dynamic model and the camera sensor model. We also developed a baseline V-ASC model based on the handcrafted feature and the newly proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) based end-to-end driving model to verify the evaluation environment of the constructed dataset and simulator. The comparison between the two methods confirmed that the end-to-end CNN technique exhibits superior accuracy in tracking the ground-truth (GT) result based on the human driving result; further, this technique is also superior in terms of the autonomy result of the test-driving scenario.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569717","","Conferences;Intelligent transportation systems","cameras;computer vision;control engineering computing;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;road vehicles;robot vision;steering systems;traffic engineering computing;visual perception","baseline V-ASC model;evaluation environment;constructed dataset;ground-truth result;human driving result;autonomy result;test-driving scenario;vision-based autonomous steering control model;deep learning methods;visual perception tasks;algorithm model;fair evaluation method;autonomous driving tasks;qualitative evaluation results;quantitative evaluation results;V-ASC evaluation;prediction result;autonomous driving result;continuous frame change;view-transformed image frame;steering value change;actual vehicle;camera sensor model;convolutional neural network;end-to-end CNN technique;end-to-end driving model","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This states the need to get several viewpoints on a system and describe correspondences between these views in order to enable traceability of emergent system properties. Today, the most abstract view found in architecture frameworks is a logical description of system functions which structures the system in terms of information flow and functional components. In this article we extend established system viewpoints towards a capability-based assessment of an automated vehicle and conduct an exemplary safety analysis to derive behavioral safety requirements.

One of the biggest challenges is the data collection and extraction of detailed personal travel data, like the type of activity performed on each visited location. As traditional survey methods under represent complex mobility patterns, the current state of the practice is to supplement or eventually replace traditional travel surveys with digital travel surveys and passive data collection methods. Although digital travel surveys can capture complex and heterogeneous user behaviour, they usually require significant inputs from the user, which is supposed to manually complete or confirm part of the survey, hence increasing the respondent's burden when prompted to recall, annotate and classify the activities performed in different locations. The core contribution of this paper is related to the extraction of locations' daily and weekly activity-travel pattern, based on the historical visit patterns. Using raw GPS data, special indexing techniques, and a set of aggregate statistics about activity scheduling and preferences, the proposed methodology provides the probability to classify the activity performed in each location. Results of this exploratory study support the idea that the proposed approach can reconstruct complex mobility patterns while minimizing the number of inputs from the respondent.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569935","","Data collection;Data mining;Smart phones;Global Positioning System;Databases;Aggregates;Transportation","data handling;Global Positioning System;mobility management (mobile radio);pattern classification","passive data collection methods;traditional survey methods;digital travel surveys;data extraction;mobility patterns;GPS data","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper aims to gain insight on frequent patterns of bus bunching using spatial analytics. Local and global spatial autocorrelation tests are performed on real world Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data to investigate spatial structures in the data. The spatio-temporal variations of bus bunching patterns throughout the day are further modeled using the ST-DBSCAN algorithm. Results show that the last few stops of each route exhibit statistically significant spatial autocorrelation with respect to the frequency of bunching, while the duration of bunching events is longer for route segments located in the central business district.

In the validation process, criticality metrics can be used for two different purposes. First, for the identification of test scenarios from recorded data that are later tested in simulation. Secondly, for an estimation of the safety of a specific AD system based on the likelihood of critical situations in test drives or in other words as a safety surrogate. In the past, different metrics for those purposes have been defined that work well in specific scenarios such as longitudinal traffic. However, a metric that describes criticality in all situations and is applicable to human and AD traffic is currently not available. In this paper, an approach to define a criticality metric is introduced. The metric is based on the definition of criticality as the level of driving requirements in the specific situation. The computation of the proposed metric uses elements of model predictive control using an objective function that contains four elements that describe the difficulty of the driving task. Based on those demands and a simplified driving dynamics model, the solution with the minimal criticality is computed. Finally, the metric is tested in four test scenarios that are typical for highway traffic. A short parameter variation study is conducted in order to study certain effects of the algorithm and to identify room for improvement.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569326","Safety Validation;Metric;Automated Driving;MPC","Measurement;Safety;Accidents;Trajectory;Optimization;Linear programming;Automotive engineering","optimisation;predictive control;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles","criticality metric;safety validation;automated driving;model predictive trajectory optimization;validation process;critical situations;test drives;safety surrogate;driving requirements;model predictive control;driving task;simplified driving dynamics model;minimal criticality;AD system;longitudinal traffic;highway traffic","","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With recent advances in long-term autonomous navigation, change detection under global viewpoint uncertainty has become a topic of considerable interest. In our study, we extend the traditional two-level pipeline of change detection: (1) scene registration and (2) scene comparison, to enable scalable and efficient change detection. In the traditional pipeline, the registration stage is required to align a given scene pair (i.e., query and reference PC maps) that are taken at different times into the same coordinate system, before comparing the two PCs. However, the registration stage is a time-consuming step, which makes it harder to realize a scalable change detection. Our key concept is to transform every query or reference PC beforehand into an invariant coordinate system, which should be predefined and invariant to environment changes (e.g., dynamic objects, clutters, the mapper vehicle's trajectories), so as to enable a direct comparison of spatial layout between the two different maps. The proposed framework employs an efficient bag-of-local-features (BoLF) scene model and realizes a scalable joint viewpoint-change detection.

Nevertheless, rule-based methods optimize the system locally without considering the full effect of the bus holding decisions to future trips or other performance indicators. For this reason, this work introduces a Reinforcement Learning approach which is capable of making holistic bus holding decisions in realtime after the completion of a training period.

First, the platoon system is formulated using a third-order linear model and a linear feedback controller under the MPF topology. Then, we introduce a new definition of desired inter-vehicle distances using the constant time headway (CTH) policy, which avoids inconsistency in inter-vehicle distances. Under the proposed definition, we present a sufficient condition to guarantee string stability by analyzing the feasible region of feedback gains. It is proved that there exist string stable feedback gains if the time headway is lower bounded. The result indicates that increasing the number of predecessors can reduce the time headway for string stability, which in turn increases the road capacity.

The proposed Bus-Holding Transit Signal Priority (BHTSP) is implemented and evaluated for a detailed isolated intersection constructed in VISSIM microsimulation software resembling the intersection of Alumni Mall and Main Street in Blacksburg, VA, USA. The impact of the proposed strategy was assessed for Blacksburg Transit vehicles arriving at the major Squires Eastbound bus stop, using high quality data that includes up-to-date vehicle flows, signal timing, transit schedules, and actual transit arrival, departure and dwell times. An advanced vehicle actuated control logic was implemented using the VISSIM COM Application Programming Interface (API) to emulate communications between transit vehicles and signal controller. When a transit vehicle is approaching the bus stop, the transit vehicle that is dwelling at the stop is forced to hold past its dwell time and wait for the upstream vehicle to arrive and dwell, in order to subsequently generate a priority request that would serve more than one transit vehicle convoying from the stop towards the intersection. This strategy results in an improved TSP performance by reducing the number of priority requests, missed TSP calls, and reducing the adverse effects on non-transit traffic at the main arterial. The proposed BHTSP was further fortified by utilizing V2I communications, the Connected BHTSP (C-BHTSP) strategy has resulted in 61% reduction of transit delay in the network compared to the base scenario, alongside a 38% reduction in early green priority requests, reducing the incurred arterial vehicle delay by 32%, and reducing total additional system stops by 51% compared to conventional TSP strategy.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569831","transit signal priority;priority requests management;simulation and modelling","Delays;Predictive models;Detectors;Analytical models;Optimization;Vehicular ad hoc networks","application program interfaces;control engineering computing;digital simulation;rapid transit systems;road traffic control;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","vehicle-to-infrastructure communication;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;V2V communication;V2I communication;bus-holding transit signal priority strategy;VISSIM microsimulation software;USA;Blacksburg VA;VISSIM COM application programming interface;VISSIM COM API;C-BHTSP strategy;Connected BHTSP strategy;Squires Eastbound bus stop;Blacksburg Transit vehicles","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This MCA combines the decision-making process, the path planning and the control algorithms. In order to ensure the safety and smoothness of the vehicle navigation, a decision-making strategy for handling lane change maneuvers is proposed by means of a robust Two-Sequential Level Bayesian Decision Network (TSLDN). The latter is utilized for the driving situation assessment, the decision-making and for safety verification of the current performed maneuver. Moreover, from actual navigation risk assessment standpoint, a dual-safety criterion combining an Extended Time-To-Collision (ETTC) and a novel Dynamic Predicted Inter-Distance Profile (DPIDP) is developed. The DPIDP is evaluated on-line as the actual distance between vehicles during lane changes maneuvers over an observed control horizon. Thanks to this proposed algorithm, a safety retrospection over the current maneuver risk could be carried out. In this way, the overall MCA described in this paper allows the best probabilistic decision to achieve the vehicle navigation task in hazardous situations while maximizing its safety. Several simulation results show the good performance of the overall proposed control architecture, mainly in terms of efficiency to handle probabilistic decision-making even for very risky/complex scenarios.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569401","","Safety;Decision making;Vehicle dynamics;Navigation;Uncertainty;Probabilistic logic;Task analysis","Bayes methods;collision avoidance;decision making;motion control;navigation;path planning;probability;risk management;road safety;road traffic;road traffic control;road vehicles","multicontroller architecture;two-sequential level Bayesian decision network;dynamic predicted inter-distance profile;extended time-to-collision;ETTC;DPIDP;safety verification;driving situation assessment;lane change maneuvers;decision-making process;safe automated driving;safe autonomous overtaking maneuver;probabilistic decision-making;vehicle navigation task;MCA;safety retrospection;lane changes maneuvers;dual-safety criterion;actual navigation risk assessment standpoint","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The robust satisfaction of such safety constraints can be achieved by imposing the terminal state to enter a Robust Invariant Set (RIS), which is known to result into a potentially high number of additional constraints, thus increasing the computational complexity of the controller. Our controller, instead, relies on recent results on the calculation of low-complexity RIS to significantly reduce the number of constraints in the MPC controller.

Their movements are not regulated by traffic rules, hence they interact more frequently to negotiate priority over the shared space. To estimate the safeness and efficiency of shared spaces, reproducing the traffic behavior in such traffic places is important. In this paper, we consider and combine different levels of interaction between pedestrians and cars in shared space environments. Our proposed model consists of three layers: a layer to plan trajectories of road users; a force-based modeling layer to reproduce free flow movement and simple interactions; and a game-theoretic decision layer to handle complex situations where road users need to make a decision over different alternatives. We validate our model by simulating scenarios involving various interactions between pedestrians and cars and also car-to-car interaction.

A model of driver behavior could be used to increase safety, to improve the functionality of an advanced driver assistant system (ADAS), as well as to increase the driving experience and comfort for users. Most data-driven approaches build a general model that works well for the majority of drivers in the training set. Personalization, on the other hand, addresses the problem of adapting the model on the driver. A personalized model also has to be able to adjust to changing user preferences over time. In this work, we formulate the problem of personalization in automotive scenes, and propose an approach to extract and incorporate information from previous maneuver execution to improve the performance of prediction tasks in impending maneuvers. We apply our proposed adaptation method to predict the gap taken at a left-turn scenario and show that it can boost the prediction of a neural network in terms of F1 score in comparison to the baseline method by about 7% using fully connected layer, and by more than 9% when using LSTM layer.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569691","","Vehicles;Adaptation models;Silicon;Data models;Predictive models;Data mining;Task analysis","adaptive control;driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","maneuver execution;driving experience;advanced driver assistant system;driver behavior;automotive field;prediction accuracy;driver model;past maneuver executions;adaptation method;prediction tasks;automotive scenes;user preferences;personalized model;training set;data-driven approaches","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enhance the computational efficiency of dynamic programming, we design three value function approximation methods to estimate the optimal value functions, which are rollout algorithm, interpolation method and neural network with back propagation, respectively. In particular, the rollout algorithm uses one step forward prediction structure to generate the optimal train control law, while the interpolation method employs a lattice partitioning process for every stage in dynamic programming.

In the first scenario, only one charging station was used. The second scenario considered two charging stations that were located at the same terminus. In the third scenario, two charging stations were located at opposite terminuses. The costs and utilization rates of the buses were analyzed with operation intervals up to 40 minutes. The first scenario with a single charging station had the lowest costs for the entire bus fleet system when the utilization rate was considered. Furthermore, the results show that certain schedule intervals are more cost-beneficial in terms of vehicle specific life-cycle costs than others.

These generate comfortable behavior with good traffic flow, but cannot guarantee safety of their maneuvers. Therefore, we contribute a safety verification method for trajectories under occlusions. The field-of-view of the ego vehicle and a map are used to identify critical sensing field edges, each representing a potentially hidden obstacle. The state of occluded obstacles is unknown, but can be over-approximated by intervals over all possible states. Then set-based methods are extended to provide occupancy predictions for obstacles with state intervals.

Grid-based approaches discretize the environment into grid cells, which implicitly solves the data association between measurement data and the filtered state on this grid representation. Recent approaches estimate, in addition to occupancy probabilities, cell velocity distributions using a low-level particle filter. Measured occupancy can thus be classified as static or dynamic, whereby a subsequent tracking of moving objects can be limited to dynamic cells. However, the data association between those cells and multiple predicted objects that are close to each other remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a new association approach in that context. Our main idea is that particles of the underlying low-level particle filter are linked to those high-level objects, i.e., an object label is attached to each particle. Cells are thus associated to objects by evaluating the particle label distribution of that cell. In addition, a subsequent clustering is performed, in which multiple clusters of an object are extracted and finally checked for plausibility to further increase the robustness. Our approach is evaluated with real sensor data in challenging scenarios with occlusions and dense traffic.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569511","","Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Object tracking;Sociology;Statistics;Particle tracking;Estimation","object detection;object tracking;particle filtering (numerical methods);target tracking;traffic engineering computing","data association;grid-based object tracking;particle labeling;surrounding objects;sensor data;safe autonomous driving;grid cells;measurement data;filtered state;grid representation;cell velocity distributions;measured occupancy;subsequent tracking;moving objects;dynamic cells;multiple predicted objects;high-level objects;object label;particle label distribution;low-level particle filter","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enable safe and comfortable driving, sensing the current situation is not sufficient, but accurately predicted trajectories of other traffic participants are required. The paper presents a novel trajectory prediction approach utilizing a combination of maneuver classification and probabilistic estimation of temporal properties with a model based trajectory representation. Probabilistic time-to-lane-change estimation is applied to gather information about the conditional distribution for the time of lane marking crossing. Lower tails of the distribution, which represent more critical lane change maneuvers, are utilized with a suitable prediction model to estimate appropriate trajectories. The three parts of the prediction framework are evaluated on the NGSIM data set. It shows, that based on a good performance of the maneuver prediction as well as the time-to-lane-change estimation, lane change trajectories with high accuracy can be predicted. In particular, the consideration of critical maneuver executions shows promising results and demonstrates its general applicability in real-world scenarios.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569296","","Trajectory;Estimation;Safety;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling","driver information systems;probability;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;safety-critical software","NGSIM data set;maneuver prediction;lane change trajectories;safety critical maneuvers;automated highway driving;automated vehicles;safe driving;comfortable driving;traffic participants;novel trajectory prediction approach;maneuver classification;probabilistic estimation;trajectory representation;probabilistic time-to-lane-change estimation;lane marking crossing;critical lane change maneuvers","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thanks to the state-of-art of the Auto Fare Collection (AFC) system, every individual trip information is recorded. However this system only provides information of origin and destination spatial-temporal information, the specific route that chosen by every passenger are not available. In this paper, a passengers' routing behavior extracting method, which combines the analytical method and the data based method, is proposed. This method firstly models the travel time to obtain the effective path set based on some rules. By applying the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering, the AFC date between an OD pair is assigned to every effective path such that the probability of being chosen for every effective path can be obtained. Our method can achieve a relatively high accuracy with low computing cost when comparing with other methods.

The problem is to determine the optimal order in which vehicles should travel through an intersection under the assumptions that the longitudinal velocity of all vehicles can be controlled along a predefined path. In the original formulation one quadratic optimization program was solved for each possible crossing order of the vehicles and collisions were avoided by formulating constraints that only allowed one vehicle at the time inside the intersection. To make this algorithm more effective, we formulate less restrictive collision avoidance constraints by introducing one critical zone for each point where two predefined paths cross. It is shown that this formulation leads to a decrease in the number of quadratic optimization programs that need to be solved to find the best crossing order. Further, an algorithm is provided that finds the number of crossing sequences which yield unique formulations of the optimization program. The results show that when simulating more complex scenarios, like four vehicles traveling through an ordinary intersection, the reduction of computational time and the total time it takes for all vehicles to make it through the intersection can be significantly reduced using these less restrictive constraints.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569797","","Collision avoidance;Cost function;Accidents;Autonomous vehicles;Safety;Optimal control","collision avoidance;quadratic programming;road safety;road traffic","intersection crossing;longitudinal velocity;quadratic optimization program;crossing sequences;restrictive constraints;collision avoidance constraints;optimization based algorithm;collaborative driving safety","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it implies high computational complexity for model building in the context of a complicated network topology, e.g., urban network. Hence, this paper develops a method for capturing and quantifying the intricate spatio-temporal correlations. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we offer a physically intuitive approach to capture the spatio-temporal correlation between traffic in different roads, which is related to the road network topology, time-varying speed, and time-varying trip distribution. With this approach, only the parameters, namely time-varying lags, in our STARIMA (Space-Time Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) based model should be adjusted in different time periods of the day. It guarantees the prediction accuracy and makes the predictor readily amendable to suit changing road and traffic conditions. Second, a metric named traffic transition probability calculated based on trip distribution, as well as a threshold ε are applied for selecting the most spatio-temporally correlated neighbors of a target road. Thus, the complexity of model building will be reduced dramatically. Trace-driven experiments are conducted from two aspects. First, our proposed prediction method has superior accuracy compared with ARIMA and the back propagation neural network model (BPNN) based method, but has much reduced computational complexity. Second, the results show that the prediction accuracy is not always proportional to the increase in the number of spatial neighbors considered for a target road. The trade-off between accuracy and complexity depends on the configuration of ε.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569976","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569976","","Roads;Correlation;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Turning;Computational complexity;Buildings","autoregressive moving average processes;backpropagation;neural nets;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","short-term traffic flow prediction;traffic prediction;urban network;road network topology;time-varying speed;time-varying trip distribution;time-varying lags;prediction accuracy;spatio-temporally correlated neighbors;prediction method;spatio-temporal correlation;computational complexity;space-time autoregressive integrated moving average;back propagation neural network model;traffic transition probability;ARIMA;BPNN","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper therefore presents a multi-class Lagrangian representation for a traffic flow consisting of cars and PTW. The capability of PTW to have higher speeds than cars makes the existing Lagrangian discretization approaches inadequate. We accordingly introduce a novel discretization method for mixed cars and PTW traffic mitigating such limitation, and also capable of reproducing a follow-the-leader type mobility.

Cyclists are particularly exposed to this form of pollution due to their proximity to vehicles' tailpipes. In a number of recent studies, it is been shown that exposure to this form of pollution eventually outweighs the cardio-vascular benefits associated with cycling. Hence during cycling there are conflicting effects that affect the cyclist. On the one hand, cycling effort gives rise to health benefits, whereas exposure to pollution clearly does not. Mathematically speaking, these conflicting effects give rise to convex utility functions that describe the health threats accrued to cyclists. More particularly, and roughly speaking, for a given level of background pollution, there is an optimal length of journey time that minimises the health risks to a cyclist. In this paper, we consider a group of cyclists that share a common route. This may be recreational cyclists, or cyclists that travel together from an origin to destination. Given this context, we ask the following question. What is the common speed at which the cyclists should travel, so that the overall health risks can be minimised? We formulate this as an optimisation problem with consensus constraints. More specifically, we design an intelligent speed advisory system that recommends a common speed to a group of cyclists taking into account different levels of fitness of the cycling group, or different levels of electric assist in the case that some or all cyclists use e-bikes (electric bikes). To do this, we extend a recently derived consensus result to the case of quasi-convex utility functions. Simulation studies in different scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569725","","Optimization;Air pollution;Roads;Urban areas;Atmospheric modeling","air pollution;alarm systems;bicycles;convex programming;intelligent transportation systems;motorcycles;road traffic","health risks;recreational cyclists;intelligent speed advisory system;traffic-related pollution;cardio-vascular benefits;e-bikes;electric bikes;quasiconvex utility functions","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our method is based on stacked gated recurrent units (GRUs). It accepts a short interval of automobile sensor data as input and computes a low-dimensional representation of that data, which can then be used to accurately solve a range of tasks. With this representation, we (1) predict the exact values of the sensors in the short term (up to three seconds in the future), (2) forecast the long-term average values of these same sensors, (3) infer additional contextual information that is not encoded in the data, including the identity of the driver behind the wheel, and (4) build a knowledge base that can be used to auto-label data and identify risky states. We evaluate our approach on a dataset collected by Audi, which equipped a fleet of test vehicles with data loggers to store all sensor readings on 2,098 hours of driving on real roads.

Whereas most research focuses on enhanced environment perception and vehicle trajectory planning methodologies, this contribution proposes a generic concept employing inter-vehicle communications to coordinate maneuvers of AVs. Not targeting a specific application, the concept is based on a generic description of vehicle behaviors, leveraging the well-known concept of Frénet frames. By sharing a vehicle's planned maneuver with surrounding traffic participants, inter-vehicle communications reduces the uncertainty associated to the prediction of future vehicle maneuvers. In case of conflicting maneuvers, vehicles are given the opportunity to disseminate a desired trajectory in addition to its planned trajectory. Maneuver coordination is then established in a three-step implicit distributed fashion, based on common right-of-way rules and on both disseminated types of trajectories. Next to the introduction of the maneuver coordination process, this contribution elaborates on related research questions and provides an outlook on an extension to a well-known microscopic simulation environment to analyze effects of the maneuver coordination process on inter-vehicle communications and traffic efficiency. The proposed concept aims at providing a generic concept to reach coordination between Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs).","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569442","Cooperative Driving;Trajectory;V2V Communications","Trajectory;Protocols;Uncertainty;Planning;Merging;Roads;Shape","mobile robots;path planning;road safety;road traffic control;road vehicles;trajectory control","intervehicle communications;automated vehicles;vehicle maneuvers;maneuver coordination process;vehicle behaviors;vehicle trajectory planning methodologies;AVs;traffic participants;generic approach;generic concept","","","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework that is able to jointly predict continuous motions for multiple interacting road participants under any driving scenarios and is capable of forecasting the duration of each interaction, which can enhance the prediction performance and efficiency.

In this paper, we have addressed a fundamental question in TMI PAR planning: do there exist optimal PARs which only depend on the physical airport or airspace capacity but not the demand? We show that this conjecture holds true in the deterministic capacity case but not in the general stochastic case. Several critical implications of this conclusion are discussed. We propose a new stochastic model and develop a heuristic saturation technique. We demonstrate that this technique can not only reveal the properties and limiting behaviors of GDP models but also could potentially be used as a robust PAR policy when facing demand uncertainty. We then show this ancillary saturation technique in GDP planning becomes an indispensable tool in CTOP optimization.

The SBRP is a special case of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with a common destination. We propose a new approach for solving the SBRP based on the existing notion of a shareability network, which has been used recently in the context of dynamic ridepooling problems. To adapt this method to large-scale SBRP instances, we propose i) a node compression of the shareability network method with optimality guarantees, and ii) a heuristic-based edge compression technique that works well in practice. We show that the compressed problem leads to an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) of reduced dimensionality that can be solved very efficiently using off-the-shelf ILP solvers.

Eco-routing for HEVs aims to optimize fuel consumption by deciding the best route and when to use or recover electrical power based on topological and traffic information. In this work, a simple predictive speed model is used to derive a fast semi-analytical solution of the powertrain energy management. The predicted fuel consumption on each road segment is a function of the desired trade-off between fuel economy and battery use. This modeling complexity is addressed by introducing a novel road network model which takes into account the feasible battery charge variation at road segment level. Also, the routing of HEVs adds several intrinsic constraints and complexity to the classical shortest path problem (SPP).

For example, a vehicle can be equipped with advanced sensors (e.g., LIDAR, camera or radar) to perform complex driving maneuvers by itself and/or communicate with other vehicles or road-side infrastructures to assist drivers in safer driving. Since the operation of an automotive application is closely tied to the underlying platform characteristics, it requires significant integration effort when the application needs to operate on a wide range of platforms such as other vehicle types or road-side infrastructures. To reduce such effort, we propose a method to implement automotive applications in a platform-independent way. Our approach is to define the automotive domain-specific QoS (Quality of Service) parameters that allow an application to specify the expected quality of sensor input or actuator output independent of a particular platform for safe operation. The application interacts with a platform through several primitive APIs to inform QoS requirements, to read/write sensors/actuators values according to the specified QoS, and to handle exceptions upon any QoS violation.

Above all, this applies to the assessment of the autonomous vehicle's performance in the presence of vulnerable road users' behavior: While experiments for the interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians in critical traffic scenarios are hardly conductable in reality, virtual experiments often suffer from plausibility. In order to solve this issue, we present a mixed reality testbed for the verification and validation of autonomous vehicles faced with realistic road user behavior in critical, worst case traffic scenarios.

Edie's definition on traffic flow rate, density, and speed are introduced and extended. Then, three-dimensional spatial-temporal vessel trajectories are plotted and a boundary interpolation algorithm is proposed to measure the three area-wide vessel traffic flow characteristics.

In this paper, a method of generating complete test suite for the CTCS-3 Target Speed Monitor (TSM) has been presented, based on Input Equivalence Class Partitioning (IECP) test theory. Firstly, according to the system requirement specification (SRS) of CTCS-3, the finite state machine models of TSM are built, which satisfy the different brake control modes of driver with high Priority and Automatic Train Protection (ATP) with high Priority. Secondly, the Input/Output (I/O) equivalence and the equivalence class partition theory are applied to obtain two kinds of IECPs with different braking control modes. Finally, the fault models and fault domain of system under test (SUT) are introduced. Two complete test suites of TSM are generated, which can detect any faults in its given fault domain.

Based on the results of expert interviews, various input variations were implemented and evaluated in a driving study on the motorway. The experts generally preferred the activation of the indicator lever in combination with steering wheel contact for lane change requests. This input variation enables the driver to express his wish without active intervention in the vehicle guidance.

In recent years, much effort has been put into developing driver models to predict traffic scenes as realistic as possible according to human behavior. In this paper, we present a method for behavioral-specific trajectory planning using dedicated driver models. The main idea is to first calculate a reference trajectory using a suitable model to achieve the desired behavior and then to incorporate this reference trajectory into an optimal control problem to obtain an acceleration- and jerk-optimal trajectory. A major strength of this method is in the small computation time, since the problem is formalized as a quadratic optimization problem and can thus be efficiently solved in real time, even for a huge number of optimization variables.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569373","","Trajectory;Planning;Vehicles;Acceleration;Mathematical model;Cost function","mobile robots;optimal control;path planning;quadratic programming;road traffic control;road vehicles;trajectory control","behavioral-specific trajectory planning;reference trajectory;jerk-optimal trajectory;automated vehicles;traffic scenes;driver models;optimal control;acceleration-optimal trajectory;quadratic optimization problem","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, DSRC does not have the line-of-sight limitation of ranging sensors and thus can “see” traffic farther ahead, which lends itself well to anticipating the movements of nearby vehicles. We have developed an algorithm that uses such data to predict whether a desired lane change will result in an unsafe situation, and prevents the lane change if that is the case. The effectiveness was evaluated in the microscopic traffic simulator VISSIM using a freeway network that has been well calibrated with rush hour traffic data. System performance in terms of safety was estimated using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) under a variety of traffic scenarios (different congestion levels, penetration rates of connected vehicles and application-equipped vehicles).

A model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach is a powerful framework for learning a responsive traffic control policy for short-term traffic demand changes without prior environmental knowledge. Previous RL approaches could handle high-dimensional feature space using a standard neural network, e.g., a convolutional neural network; however, to control traffic on a road network with multiple intersections, the geometric features between roads had to be created manually. Rather than using manually crafted geometric features, we developed an RL-based traffic signal control method that employs a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). GCNNs can automatically extract features considering the traffic features between distant roads by stacking multiple neural network layers. We numerically evaluated the proposed method in a six-intersection environment.

A fully 3D local obstacle grid, maintained through multiple frames and updated accordingly to the UAV movement, is built accumulating multiple observations coming from the 360 stereo vision sensing suite. Visual data is also used to extract information regarding the drone attitude and position while exploring the environment. Sparse optical flow collected from both front and down facing stereo cameras is used to estimate UAV movement through multiple frames. The down-looking stereo pair is also used to estimate the drone height from the ground and to refine the pose estimation in a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) fashion.

To maximize performance in cooperative takeovers, drivers should be informed sufficiently about the automation's intent for the shared control phase. Priming a driver for an automated control action shares basic concepts with directional yet conventional take-over requests. Based on results from the literature concerning directional take-over requests, we designed three different modality configurations. In contrast to previous studies and because of the background of a later cooperative take-over, we focused on perception, taskload and criticality assessment of the directional information instead of evaluating purely human take-over performance. Results indicate better perception for configurations with an auditory component, yet taskload and criticality ratings were not affected by the different modalities.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569619","Automated Driving;Take-Over;Priming;Cooperative Driving","Vehicles;Task analysis;Visualization;Automation;Vibrations;Road transportation;Ergonomics","cooperative systems;driver information systems;man-machine systems;road traffic control","driving automation;information processing;driver support;partly active control;shared control phase;directional take-over requests;directional information;drivers multimodal priming;cooperative take-over;cooperative shared control;automated control action;auditory component","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, reducing a vehicle's energy consumption and emissions has become a research topic with ever-increasing interest, especially in the area of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Among a variety of ITS applications, environmentally-friendly navigation (or eco-routing), which aims at finding a minimal energy or minimal emissions route, has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and total emissions. Previous research on environmentally-friendly navigation mainly focuses on pre-trip eco-routing. However, this approach may not be optimal due to the highly dynamic evolution of traffic conditions. In contrast, carrying out dynamic en-route eco-navigation can potentially further improve environmental sustainability. This paper presents a methodology for dynamic en-route eco-navigation research, in which details for strategy design, implementation and evaluation are elaborated.

To alleviate the truck congestion problem in container terminals, several approaches have been proposed and implemented. One of them refers to Truck Appointment Systems (TASs), which are technological platforms aiming to coordinate truck flows at ports, by supporting the scheduling of truck arrivals and truck operations. In this paper an integer programming model is formulated to schedule the operations of trucks that have to pick up or deliver containers in a container terminal operating with a TAS. The mathematical model seeks to assign appointments to the different time slots composing the gate opening time, with the goal of optimizing terminal resources, guaranteeing a predefined service level to haulers (i.e. maximum turnaround times in the container terminal), while minimizing congestion inside the terminal. The validity of the proposed optimization approach is highlighted by an experimental campaign based on real data sets provided by some Italian and Mexican container terminals. The obtained results highlight that the proposed model is efficient in reducing waiting times of trucks, improving both the operation efficiency and the accuracy of resource allocation in container terminals. Particularly, it can be observed that the terminal vehicle capacity and the truck arrival pattern are the most significant factors that affect the total truck delay.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569623","","Containers;Logic gates;Productivity;Mathematical model;Optimization;Delays;Planning","discrete event simulation;goods distribution;integer programming;minimisation;resource allocation;road traffic;scheduling;sea ports;transportation;vehicle routing","resource allocation;integer programming;truck congestion problem;Truck Appointment system;optimal truck scheduling;truck arrival pattern;terminal vehicle capacity;Mexican container terminals;Italian container terminals;terminal resources;container terminal","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a pedestrian detection method that is based on a one-dimensional convolution neural network (lD-CNN) that processes LiDAR waveform data without delay. The proposed method sequentially inputs LiDAR waveform data to the 1D-CNN and determines whether each point belongs to a pedestrian.

In the present study, a dataset is collected and applied which includes 652,945 geotagged tweets generated by 2,933 Swedish users covering time spans of more than one year (3.6 years on average). Based on such a dataset, human mobility predictability has been explored from three aspects: 1) time history of mobility range indicating how people diffuse in space, 2) entropy and the corresponding predictability of mobility, and 3) the limits of predictability dependent on geographical boundaries and mobility range. This study reveals a dataset that captures Twitter users' mobility where they routinely visit a couple of regions at most of the time and occasionally explore new regions. A 70% potential predictability is obtained by measuring the entropy of each individual's geotagged activity trajectory using a half-day time interval. The predictability's dependence on mobility range is prolonged when the observation of mobility is geographical-boundary-free which also decreases predictability.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569770","Human mobility;geotagged activity trajectory;information theory;entropy;predictability","Entropy;Trajectory;Mobile handsets;History;Twitter;Time-frequency analysis","entropy;mobility management (mobile radio);social networking (online)","long-time social media data;urban planning;traffic forecasting;human mobility studies;geotagged social media data;user-contributed data source;individual mobility;human mobility predictability;mobility range;predictability dependent;geographical boundaries;geotagged tweets;geographical-boundary-free;half-day time interval;time 3.6 year","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The number of both vehicle miles traveled and traffic accidents has increased in the past two years, and is mainly attributed to human error, mainly due to inattentiveness during hazardous driving situations. By crowdsourcing traffic data (e.g. vehicle position, speed, direction, etc.) through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, connected vehicles (CV) can detect upcoming hazards at lane level with reasonable lead time. The work described in this paper aimed to develop and simulate an innovative V2V-based application to perform lane-level hazard prediction, and a corresponding driver response model. The concept of Lane Hazard Prediction (LHP) is to improve the mobility and safety of both individual users and the entire traffic system. LHP identifies the position of a downstream lane-level hazard (within seconds after it occurs) based on a spatial and temporal data mining and machine learning techniques. It then guides the LHP-equipped vehicles with recommended lateral maneuvers to avoid traffic jams resulting from the hazards. Simulation results demonstrate reliable hazard prediction, even when the V2V penetration rate is as low as 20%. A comprehensive evaluation of the developed LHP application from the perspectives of both user benefits and system benefits has been conducted over different CV penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed LHP application can significantly improve both the safety and mobility performance of the equipped vehicles without compromising the mobility and safety performance of the overall traffic.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569340","","Hazards;Predictive models;Mathematical model;Vehicles;Logistics;Analytical models","data mining;hazards;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;remotely operated vehicles;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","Lane Hazard Prediction application;traffic accidents;hazardous driving situations;vehicle position;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;lane-level hazard prediction;downstream lane-level hazard;temporal data mining;machine learning techniques;LHP-equipped vehicles;traffic jams;V2V penetration rate;traffic system;hazard prediction;driver response model;connected and automated vehicles;CAV;U.S. roads;spatial data mining","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We assume cooperation of other traffic participants, yet being aware of violations of this assumption.

As an advanced traffic guidance system, the VMS messages help drivers to choose the routes with lower traffic volumes. Thus, the vehicles can be more evenly distributed in the road network to improve the performance of traffic system and reduce traffic delays. To this end, the VMS technology has been widely used in the expressways of Singapore. This paper aims to evaluate the immediate impact of VMS on the overall traffic distribution of Singapore in response to accidents and obstacles. For this purpose, we consider the incidents data and their corresponding VMS messages from the two busiest expressways of Singapore, namely Pan Island Expressway (PIE) and Central Expressway (CTE). For this analysis, we ignore the VMS messages of the locations which are already congested due to traffic incidents, since the motorists may be influenced by the congestion and not entirely by the VMS messages. The next step is to obtain the locations of other VMS displays and their nearby downstream exit points. The central argument of this analysis is that if the average traffic flow of the exits increases significantly compared to that of normal days, it demonstrates the impact of the VMS messages on the drivers' behavior. Our results show that the average outgoing traffic flow from the expressways towards the exits increases by 14% after the VMS messages have been activated.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569662","","Roads;Accidents;Urban areas;Automobiles;Histograms;IEEE Sections","LED displays;road traffic;traffic control;traffic engineering computing","advanced traffic guidance system;Central Expressway;CTE;PIE;Pan Island Expressway;LED displays;motorist travel behaviour;VMS message effectiveness","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lane reductions, due to construction, road obstructions, or transitions to narrower roads, can be disruptive to traffic flow and energy efficiency of a stream of vehicles. In these instances, when there is heavy traffic flow a bottle-necking effect occurs at the reduction point. The backup of traffic is then propagated upstream causing vehicles to decelerate more often. As a result, fuel efficiency decreases and there is an increase in trip time. This research is motivated by recent articles [1] that indicate merging late could be beneficial when done in a coordinated manner. This paper will focus on a group of vehicles traveling along a high speed roadway with a lane closure. These vehicles employ a reactive Intelligent Driver Model with randomized parameters that mimic human-like car following. Our microsimulations show that, in general, high penetrations of late merging vehicles have a negative influence on traffic flow and energy efficiency.

One of big issues on the sampling based approach is efficient sampling of smooth control input because some applications require the smoothness of control input. In proposed method, series of input are sampled in frequency domain directly in order to generate the smooth input series instead of applying the digital filtering to sampled input from specified random process. The proposed method samples the magnitudes of frequency components directly and those samples are transformed to time domain signals by Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT.)

The problem is solved online by an anytime Monte Carlo sampling algorithm in combination with an efficient A* rollout heuristic. This combination makes a combined lateral and longitudinal optimization possible. The resulting policy is optimized regarding various future merge scenarios and approaches the most suitable gap while taking into account the uncertain behavior of the surrounding drivers. Therefore, we present a novel motion model representing the uncertain cooperation of other drivers. It is based on a logistic regression model estimating the probability for cooperative behavior of a human driver given a future scene.

Due to advances in automotive technology such as autonomous driving and further connectivity, the complexity of vehicles and their subsystems increases continuously. As a consequence, models and rule-based systems for fault detection become more complex and require more extensive implementation effort and expert knowledge not only within but also across several domains. Besides, vehicles produce rich amounts of data including valuable information for fault detection. These amounts cannot fully be considered by current fault detection approaches. Deep neural networks offer promising capabilities to address these challenges by allowing automated model generation for fault detection without extensive domain knowledge using vast amounts of in-vehicle data. Hence, in this work a data-driven automotive diagnostics approach to fault detection with deep neural networks is proposed in two steps. First, a novel data-driven diagnostics process to learn data-driven algorithms on in-vehicle data is presented. Second, as a key element of this process, a novel fault detection model is proposed using a combination of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks. To demonstrate the suitability for fault detection, the model is evaluated on internal engine control unit signals for pre-ignition detection in high-pressure turbocharged petrol engines. A classical machine learning processing pipeline and each neural network type separately are used as baselines for a performance comparison. Results show that the proposed model is a promising approach to data-driven automotive diagnostics outperforming all implemented baselines.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569908","","Fault detection;Automotive engineering;Data models;Sensors;Training;Numerical models;Feature extraction","automotive engineering;condition monitoring;convolution;data handling;fault diagnosis;feedforward neural nets;ignition;internal combustion engines;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets","deep neural networks;in-vehicle data;data-driven automotive diagnostics approach;data-driven algorithms;pre-ignition detection;fault detection approaches;data-driven diagnostics process;automotive technology;convolutional neural networks;long short-term memory neural networks;internal engine control unit signals;high-pressure turbocharged petrol engines;machine learning processing pipeline","","","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a bi-level optimization program is developed to optimize the location of dedicated bus lanes on a network while accounting for dynamic queue development at signalized intersections and possible queue spillbacks. The lower level evaluates the travel times on the network and the upper level determines the combination of dedicated bus lane locations that will minimize the objective function. The proposed method is applied to a test network and tested for both saturated and under-saturated traffic conditions with uniform and nonuniform demand patterns. Results show that, the proposed methodology successfully accounts for the effects of queuing. For under-saturated conditions, decrease in travel time of buses outweighs the increase in car travel time when dedicated bus lanes are implemented and the optimum solution finds that bus lanes should be implemented everywhere.

This paper aims to solve time-dependent dial-a-ride problem (TDDARP). A new greedy ant colony optimization (GACO) algorithm is developed, in which two new decision factors (repeat counter and quantity counter) are introduced to efficiently explore the search space. In addition, a method for estimating travel time using staircase regression (SR) of speed data is developed, which in turn is incorporated into GACO. Computational experiments conducted on several DARP benchmark instances in the literature show the significance of incorporating time-dependent travel times into designing high quality solution for TDDARP, while considering peak hour traffic congestion.

It is also combined with battery recharging of electric cars i.e., the level of battery power is taken into account when deciding if and where each vehicle will be relocated. The Minimum Walking Car Repositioning Problem (MWCRP) is solved whose main objective is to minimize the walking distance in the relocation tours as the walking part of a relocation tour is the most laborious, time-consuming and therefore, the most expensive part compared to the driving one. The MWCRP is extended to the k-MWCRP to handle the case that a team of drivers is required to undertake the entire set of car relocations e.g., in case of a large fleet of cars and/or operating area. To the best of our knowledge this is the first vehicle repositioning approach aiming at minimizing the relocation cost by primarily minimizing the walking cost.

A bi-level candidate evaluation strategy is presented assessing comfort and human-like driving as well as a post-check of collision avoidance with accurate geometric modeling.

The first model is based on the stereo camera system detections only, whereas the second model cooperatively combines the camera based detections with velocity and yaw rate data provided by the smart device. Our aim is to overcome limitations of tracking approaches based on single data sources. We show in numerical evaluations on scenes where cyclists are starting or turning right that the cooperation leads to an improvement in both the ability to keep track of a cyclist and the accuracy of the track particularly when it comes to occlusions in the visual system.

In the two-time-scale framework, the corridor is divided into a set of virtual lanes. The width of each lane is equal to the diameter of a pedestrian which is modeled as a disk. Being situated in a corridor, the pedestrians can either walk in a lane following each other or change to the adequate lanes. The in-lane movements of pedestrians are viewed as a one-line multi-agent dynamic system in continuous time. The lane changing behavior of pedestrians is modeled as a Markov decision process. Pedestrians will change lanes according to the transition probabilities which are functions depending on pedestrian velocities in the related lanes. Furthermore, the quantized consensus state of pedestrian flow is defined. We show that when pedestrians wish to change to faster lanes, the numbers of pedestrians in each lane converge to a balanced distribution (quantized consensus state) as shown typically in pedestrian flows. Numerical simulations and theoretical analysis are used to demonstrate the convergence properties of this method.

Similarly, those who may not have a strong balance, or physically impaired such as the elderly endure a risk when vehicle braking is sudden. In this research, a method of analysing posture via simplistic pressure mat data is achieved. The integration of identifying a passenger's posture in relation to their balance may have the potential to inform public transport operators on the levels of braking that can be used based on their passengers at the time. Additionally, the identification of passengers using hand rail supports derived from floor mats only will inform operators of the potential risk during sudden braking.

It closes the gap between the high-level decision making and path planning. A new data-driven method is proposed to extend our previous behavior estimation. The new method predicts the continuous lane-change trajectory of a target car by modeling the interaction of all its surrounding vehicles' trajectories, without over-the-air communication between vehicles. The advantages of this approach are: 1. Learning the interactive model from real data; 2. Giving long-horizon estimation of the continuous trajectory of a target vehicle.

Optimized service, higher system availability and a more efficient urban transportation system can be obtained by analyzing a wide usage behavior and diurnal patterns within such a system. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the spatio-temporal behavior of such a service, it is vital to distinguish different demand patterns occurring within urban areas. We therefore analyze the demand for carsharing in the city of Munich, Germany.

Real-time fatigue driving detection and early warning is very important to reduce the number of traffic accidents, injuries, and deaths. Although traditional ECG (Electrocardiography) based methods can effectively identify fatigue state, they need a relatively long time period (in general 5 min) signal and can not be used to monitor fatigue state in real-time. In this paper, a short-time period ECG signals oriented method is proposed to improve detection real-time character. A pre-processing scheme is present to enhance the identifiably and frequency resolution of ECG signal. Meanwhile, a support vector machine (SVM) based fatigue detection model is given.

A single-stage deep convolutional neural network is combined with a recurrent neural network, which takes a time series of the occupancy grid map as input and tracks cell states and its corresponding object hypotheses. The labels for training are created unsupervised with an automatic label generation algorithm. The proposed methods are evaluated in real-world experiments in complex inner city scenarios using the aforementioned 360° laser perception. The results show a better object detection accuracy in comparison with our old approach as well as an AUC score of 0.946 for the dynamic and static segmentation.

However, this task is challenging for planar LIDAR due to its limited vertical field of view (FOV) and quality of points. In addition, directly estimating 3D location, dimensions and heading of vehicles from an image is difficult due to the limited depth information of a monocular camera. We propose a method that fuses a vision-based instance segmentation algorithm and LIDAR-based segmentation algorithm to achieve an accurate 2D bird's-eye view object segmentation. This method combines the advantages of both camera and LIDAR sensor: the camera helps to prevent over-segmentation in LIDAR, and LIDAR segmentation removes false positive areas in the interest regions in the vision results. A modified T-linkage RANSAC is applied to further remove outliers. A better segmentation also results in a better orientation estimation.

This may influence a driver's visual behavior, cognitive states, which leads to loss of situation awareness (SA) and skills. This is dangerous if the automated system reaches its boundaries: the driver must take-over the driving task in a critical situation within a limited period of time. In this paper, a concise HMI concept of the LED ambient light positioned at the bottom of the windscreen is presented, which contains information about the status and intention of the automation, detected potential hazards and the warning for a take-over request (TOR) by varying the LED's color, frequency, lighting position and animation. The goal is to increase the SA during automated driving and improve the take-over quality while allowing the driver to perform NDRTs without distraction and annoyance. In this between-subject-design experiment in a static driving simulator, 50 participants performed a visual-motoric task on a smartphone during a 45-min automated drive with or without the new HMI.

In our framework, we use Hue Saturation Value (HSV) color filtering for traffic sign detection. In our Grassmann manifold based traffic sign recognition framework, we create subspaces of each unique traffic sign. These subspaces accommodate the uncertainties that occur during detection and variations in different instances of the same traffic sign. These subspaces lie on a Grassmann manifold and we use discriminant analysis on Grassmann manifolds for recognising them.

Predicting bike counts would help mitigate imbalances in the system. Research has focused on global prediction techniques but has neglected the role of user incentives. We adopted two computational techniques to capture BSS dynamics: mini-batch gradient descent for the linear regression (MBGDLR) and locally weighted regression (LWR). The two approaches used incremental learning based only on the previous status of the station with neither weather nor time information. The models were applied to a BSS data set for one year (2014-2015) in the San Francisco Bay Area for different prediction windows. Both models gave comparable results. LWR performed slightly better than MBGDLR for all prediction windows. The smallest prediction error for LWR was 0.31 bikes/station (4% prediction error) for a 15-minute prediction window and 0.32 bikes/station for MBGDLR. The 120-minute prediction window had the largest prediction error of 1.1 bikes/station and 1.2 bikes/station for LWR and MBGDLR, respectively.

Furthermore, we find accidents and obstructions lead to significantly greater uncertainty in performance when compared to other events. Changing a speed limit during the simulation typically leads a doubling of the prediction error. The relationship between domain length and error is also quantified. We see the smallest domains have around 4% error, whilst the largest have 12%. Finally, the model performs poorly in the extreme lows and highs of congestion and the distributions of errors have very heavy tails.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569699","","Roads;Data models;Mathematical model;Accidents;Predictive models;Maintenance engineering;Boundary conditions","data analysis;road traffic;traffic information systems","Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model;National Traffic Information Service;large scale performance assessment;smart motorway;NTIS","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We let a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent learn to drive as close as possible to a desired velocity by executing reasonable lane changes on simulated highways with an arbitrary number of lanes. By making use of a minimal state representation, consisting of only 13 continuous features, and a Deep Q-Network (DQN), we are able to achieve fast learning rates.

We focus here on one particular challenge, namely prioritized routing. Prioritized routing may need to happen even during normal times but stands out during emergencies, since emergency vehicles, police vehicles and vehicles (such as buses) that carry a lot more people may need to have a higher priority in terms of evacuation. It is also reasonable to assume that traffic police may need to perform a centralized control of traffic since they typically have a global view of the emergency and possibly have accurate real-time updates. We therefore make the following contributions in this paper: (a) We map the prioritized routing problem to the minimum-cost maximum-flow problem, a standard problem formulation in network flow theory. (b) We then develop the Prioritized Routing Assistant for Flow of Traffic (PRAFT) that casts the prioritized routing problem which includes a notion of priority of vehicles and priority of routes into the minimum cost maximum flow problem. (c) Through a series of experiments performed using the well-known traffic simulator SUMO, we could establish that PRAFT indeed maps higher priority vehicles to better quality routes and is monotonic in the sense that decreasing priority order of vehicles maps to a decreasing route quality.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569627","","Roads;Routing;Law enforcement;Heuristic algorithms;Dispatching;Centralized control;Standards","road traffic;road vehicles;telecommunication network routing;traffic engineering computing","emergency evacuation;regular traffic management;emergency vehicles;police vehicles;traffic police;prioritized routing problem;minimum-cost maximum-flow problem;standard problem formulation;network flow theory;prioritized routing assistant;minimum cost maximum flow problem;traffic simulator SUMO;quality routes;vehicles maps","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we proposed a new method and framework to evaluate the energy efficiency and emission of the vehicle based on the unsupervised learning methods. Both the real-world driving data of the evaluated vehicle and the large naturalistic driving dataset are used to perform the driving primitive analysis and coupling. Then the linear weighted estimation method could be used to calculate the testing result of the evaluated vehicle. The results show that this method can successfully identify the typical driving primitives.

In contrast to traditional approaches which require trajectory matching and manual feature selection, this method can automatically learn high-level spatial-temporal features of driver behaviors from naturalistic driving data through sequence learning. By employing two blocks of LSTMs, the proposed method feeds the sequential trajectory to the first LSTM for driver intention recognition as an intermediate indicator, which is immediately followed by a second LSTM for future trajectory prediction. Test results from real-world highway driving data show that the proposed method can, in comparison to state-of-art methods, output more accurate and reasonable estimate of different future trajectories over 5s time horizon with root mean square error (RMSE) for longitudinal and lateral prediction less than 5.77m and 0.49m, respectively.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569595","trajectory prediction;long term;intention;autonomous driving;LSTM","Trajectory;Logic gates;Roads;Prototypes;Sensors;Autonomous vehicles","learning (artificial intelligence);least mean squares methods;recurrent neural nets;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","time 5.0 s;dual long short term memory network;trajectory matching;manual feature selection;high-level spatial-temporal features;sequential trajectory;driver intention recognition;real-world highway driving data;longitudinal prediction;lateral prediction;dual LSTM networks;autonomous vehicles;vehicle trajectory prediction;intention-aware long-horizon trajectory prediction;interactive driving environments;sequence learning;root mean square error;RMSE","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within this context, the emerging interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs) points to the direction of a paradigm shift in the way in which traffic is controlled and managed. This is due to the fact that AVs can exploit different types of communication, hence take better informed decisions. Despite the amount of work dedicated to engineering solutions for supporting and implementing the different types of vehicular communication, there is a lack of analysis focusing on the implications of exploiting one (or more) type of communication. In this work, focusing on urban areas, we provide a principled and detailed analysis of the impact of different kinds of communication on reasoning capabilities of vehicles and of urban traffic control (e.g. level of deliberation).

To this end, we model detailed automated driving areas and consider a heterogeneous fleet comprised of three vehicle types: autonomous, conventional, and dual-mode. While autonomous and conventional vehicles can only operate in their designated areas, dual-mode vehicles service zone-crossing demands in which both human and autonomous driving are required. For such a hybrid network, we introduce a new mathematical planning model based on a site-dependent variant of the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem (HDARP).

The problem of pedestrian classification finds applications in advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and autonomous driving, and it has regained particular attention recently because, among other reasons, safety involving self-driving vehicles. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used in this work as classifier in distinct situations: having a single sensor data as input, and by combining data from both sensors in the CNN input layer. Range (distance) and intensity (reflectance) data from LIDAR are considered as separate channels, where data from the LIDAR sensor is feed to the CNN in the form of dense maps, as the result of sensor coordinate transformation and spatial filtering; this allows a direct implementation of the same CNN-based approach on both sensors data. In terms of late-fusion, the outputs from individual CNNs are combined by means of learning and non-learning approaches. Pedestrian classification is evaluated on a `binary classification' dataset created from the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite, and results are shown for each sensor-modality individually, and for the fusion strategies.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569666","","Laser radar;Cameras;Robot sensing systems;Three-dimensional displays;Automobiles;Training;Feature extraction","cameras;convolution;driver information systems;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;image classification;image filtering;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;optical radar;pedestrians;sensor fusion;traffic engineering computing","3D LIDAR sensor;multimodal sensor fusion;multimodal sensors data;advanced driver assistance system;ADAS;convolutional neural networks;sensor coordinate transformation;spatial filtering;autonomous driving;monocular camera;deep learning;multimodal CNN pedestrian classification;sensor-modality;binary classification dataset;nonlearning approaches","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when using deep networks for 3D object classification, large amounts of dense 3D models are required for good accuracy, which are often neither available nor feasible to process due to memory requirements. Therefore, in our method we reproject the 3D object onto the image plane using the reconstructed points, lines or both. We utilize this sparse depth prior within an auxiliary network branch that acts as a regularizer during training. We show that this auxiliary regularizer helps to improve accuracy compared to 2D classification on a real-world dataset.

In NDT, map space is divided into the grids, and for each grid, normal distribution (ND) of the points are calculated, and LiDAR scan is matched to these NDs. Bigger grid sizes (lower resolution) are more favorable because it can abstract more points in each grid and reduce map size. However, if the resolution is low, many details of the environment are ignored, and the localization accuracy degrades. This information loss and localization error is different from place to place on the map and can be evaluated beforehand for each resolution. In this work, ten map factors are used to evaluate the localization ability of the map in a specific position for each resolution. Using the evaluation result, for each position of the map, a lower resolution that can preserve the required localization accuracy are determined. In this method, NDT map is generated by adaptively selecting the resolution for each position of the map. Experimental results in Shinjuku, Tokyo, show that by using this strategy, map size can be reduced by up to 32% of the original size while the mean localization error remains less than 0.141m.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569236","LiDAR;NDT;abstraction;self-localization;map resolution","Three-dimensional displays;Gaussian distribution;Laser radar;Layout;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Ellipsoids;Autonomous vehicles","mobile robots;normal distribution;optical radar;path planning;road vehicles;robot vision;transforms","LiDAR scan;lower resolution;map size;information loss;map factors;localization ability;required localization accuracy;NDT map;mean localization error;adaptive resolution refinement;localization error modeled;accurate self-localization;map-matching;map space;grid sizes;localization accuracy;normal distribution transform;light detection and ranging","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Estimating when pedestrians will cross streets has proved a challenging task, since they can move in many different directions, suddenly change motion, be occluded by a variety of obstacles and distracted while talking to other pedestrians or typing on a mobile phone. Moreover, their decisions can also be affected by several factors. This paper explores the ways pedestrians' intention estimation has been studied, evaluated, and evolved. It provides a literature review on pedestrian behavior prediction, addresses available solutions, state-of-the-art developments, and hurdles to be overcome towards reaching a solution that is closer to the human ability to predict and interpret such scenarios.

However, it is envisaged that in the next generation of transportation networks with mixed autonomy, system parameters such as service rates may vary as autonomous vehicle penetration rate changes. Aligned with this, we propose a signal control strategy which, unlike previous approaches, can handle both unknown mean network demands and service rates. To this end, we use stochastic gradient projection to develop a cyclic iterative control, where at every cycle, the timing plan of the signals is updated. At each iteration, the update rule is based on the measured changes in the network queue lengths. If the network mean arrival and service rates are assumed to be constant, the proposed iterative signal control is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution. We describe the intuition behind our algorithm, and further demonstrate through simulation studies that our iterative control scheme can successfully stabilize the system.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569240","","Timing;Knowledge engineering;Linear matrix inequalities;Transportation;Length measurement;Iterative algorithms;Throughput","gradient methods;iterative methods;queueing theory;road traffic;stochastic processes","urban traffic networks;unknown system parameters;signal control strategy;transportation networks;autonomous vehicle penetration rate changes;unknown mean network demands;cyclic iterative control;network queue lengths;network mean arrival;iterative signal control;iterative control scheme","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Continuous actions allow for arbitrary trajectories and hence are applicable to a much wider class of problems than existing cooperative approaches with discrete action spaces. Based on cooperative modeling of other agents, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in conjunction with Decoupled-UCT evaluates the action-values of each agent in a cooperative and decentralized way, respecting the interdependence of actions among traffic participants. The extension to continuous action spaces is addressed by incorporating novel MCTS-specific enhancements for efficient search space exploration.

An important aspect of the vehicle environment is the layout of the road segment right ahead of the vehicle, such as the presence and type of an intersection, as it defines the scenario, provides context information and constrains the future motion of traffic participants. The knowledge of upcoming intersections can help to improve various aspects in the context of driver assistance systems and automated driving, such as the prediction of traffic participants or the adjustment of a system with respect to the current scenario.

Second, it proposes a transfer-learning technique allowing to train with fewer samples and showing that intermediate features from path prediction are also beneficial for intersection classification tasks.

Once this congestion occurs, the maximum flow through this bottleneck decreases (capacity drop). By limiting the flow towards the bottleneck, one can prevent or postpone the capacity drop and the accompanying congestion. In case the bottleneck is caused by an on-ramp, a common approach is to meter the on-ramp flow. For metering to be effective the algorithm has to be tuned carefully. Normally, the parameters of a metering algorithm are fit for the situation. However, traffic is dynamic and external factors might change, which both lead to changes in parameters of the traffic process. This paper studies how these parameters can be updated dynamically in the control algorithm. It considers various ramp metering algorithms and introduces methods to adapt their parameters. They are tested with simulations using the METANET model. This shows that parameter adaptation improves traffic state. Gains in travel time due to parameter adaptation are typically several percent compared to non-adaptive ramp metering.

Due to the difficulties in GNSS observation quality modeling in the urban areas, the data-driven modeling provides an alternative approach to assist the GNSS integrity monitoring, which makes it possible to ensure the trustiness and safety in certain critical applications. In this paper, according to the concept of “local integrity”, a GNSS observation quality modeling method using GNSS pseudorange residual data within different time slots is presented, and the derived local models are employed to adjust the weights of satellite measurements in navigation calculation.

Given prior knowledge of curbside geometry (i.e. angle made by intersecting curbs at the corner point of interest and the coordinates of the corner itself), the presented framework can accurately predict pedestrian trajectories even in new, unseen intersections. This is achieved by learning motion primitives in a common frame, called the curbside coordinate frame. A key insight in developing this common frame is to ensure that trajectories from intersections with different geometries, representing the same behavior, are spatially similar in the common frame. Motion primitives learned in such a common frame, can then be easily generalized to predict in new intersections, with different geometries than the ones trained on. We test our algorithm on real pedestrian trajectory datasets collected at two intersections, with distinctly different curbside and crosswalk geometries. A comparison of our algorithm with [1] demonstrates improved prediction accuracies of pedestrian trajectory prediction in the case of same training and test intersections, and the improvement of accuracy in the most different training and test intersections scenarios. The result also shows additional context, such as information about pedestrian traffic lights, if available, can be easily incorporated in our prediction model for further improvement in prediction accuracy.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569812","Pedestrian motion prediction;skewed coordinate system;Contravariant components;affine transformation;motion primitives;common frame;transferable model;Gaussian Process;sparse coding","Trajectory;Geometry;Predictive models;Training;Context modeling;Automobiles;Prediction algorithms","Gaussian processes;geometry;learning (artificial intelligence);pedestrians;road safety;traffic engineering computing","motion primitives;pedestrian trajectory datasets;prediction accuracy;pedestrian traffic lights;curbside coordinate frame;transferable pedestrian trajectory prediction model;intersection corners;curbside geometry;crosswalk geometries;Gaussian process","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, since a pedestrian may suddenly change his/her direction and cross the road, it is difficult to predict his/her behavior directly. Here, we focus on the fact that experienced drivers usually pass by a pedestrian while preparing to step on the brake at any moment when they feel danger. If driver assistant systems can estimate such experienced driver's decisions, they could early detect the pedestrian in danger of collision. Therefore, we classify the driver's decisions into three types by referring to the accelerator operation of drivers, and propose a method to estimate the type of the driver's decision. The drivers are considered to decide their actions focusing on various behaviors and states of a pedestrian, namely pedestrian's attributes. Since the driver's decisions change along the timeline, the use of a temporal context is considered to be effective. Thus, in this paper, we propose an estimation method using a recurrent neural network architecture with the pedestrian's attributes as input. We constructed a dataset collected by experienced drivers in control of the vehicle and evaluated the performance, and then confirmed the effectiveness of the use of pedestrian's attributes.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569955","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569955","","Vehicles;Brakes;Roads;Safety;Estimation;Accidents;Focusing","driver information systems;neural net architecture;pattern classification;pedestrians;recurrent neural nets;road accidents;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles","pedestrian attributes;driver assistant systems;recurrent neural network architecture;drivers insight estimation;drivers decision classification;traffic accident reduction;safe passing","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although there exist a lot of works dealing with modeling driver behavior of a single object, it remains a challenge to make predictions for multiple highly interactive agents that react to each other simultaneously. In this work, we propose a generic probabilistic hierarchical recognition and prediction framework which employs a two-layer Hidden Markov Model (TLHMM) to obtain the distribution of potential situations and a learning-based dynamic scene evolution model to sample a group of future trajectories. Instead of predicting motions of a single entity, we propose to get the joint distribution by modeling multiple interactive agents as a whole system. Moreover, due to the decoupling property of the layered structure, our model is suitable for knowledge transfer from simulation to real world applications as well as among different traffic scenarios, which can reduce the computational efforts of training and the demand for a large data amount. A case study of highway ramp merging scenario is demonstrated to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed framework.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569780","","Hidden Markov models;Predictive models;Data models;Training;Probabilistic logic;Automobiles","decision making;driver information systems;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic","robust recognition;traffic situation;autonomous driving;risk assessment;effective decision making;modeling driver behavior;multiple highly interactive agents;generic probabilistic hierarchical recognition;prediction framework;two-layer Hidden Markov Model;learning-based dynamic scene evolution model;single entity;multiple interactive agents;traffic scenarios","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, there are many profiles of public transport users and not all of them rely only on time to build their itinerary. Other qualitative criteria such as the cleanliness of the vehicle, the number of visitors to the stations, safety, etc. are also taken into account.

To address it, this paper proposes a remaining useful life prediction model based on hybrid long-short sequences for engines. For long sequence, long short-term memory neural network is used to predict RUL by mining smoothed data potential association rules. For short sequence, time window is used to determine the size of short-term sequence, and a direct relation between engine state and RUL is modeled by gradient boosting regression. Finally, back propagation neural network is used to analyze the RUL results of long sequence and short sequence to obtain hybrid sequence prediction result.

In previous studies, it was confirmed that decreasing arousal levels affect physiological indices, behavioral indices, and driving performance. The goal of this study is to classify the alert states of drivers, particularly the slightly drowsy state, based on physiological indices, behavioral measures, and driving performance. First, the relationship between the arousal level of a driver, physiological signals, such as electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram signals, behavioral measures, and driving performance is investigated based on analysis of data measured by a driving simulator (DS) and driver monitoring system. Next, to classify the alert and the slightly drowsy states utilizing machine learning algorithms, a total of 32 features are extracted from the measured data over a period of 10 seconds. Four machine learning algorithms, namely logistic regression, support vector machines, the k-nearest neighbor classifier, and random forest (RF), are utilized for the classification of driver drowsiness in this study. As a result, it is confirmed that the RF method can obtain up to 81.4% accuracy when distinguishing between alert and slightly drowsy states.

In this paper we will introduce the safety hypotheses for seven driver safety use cases being deployed by the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads in the Ipswich Connected Vehicle Pilot in Australia. The safety performance indicators to test these hypotheses will be introduced as well. The main challenge in evaluating the safety benefits is only using the information collected from C-ITS units without augmentation from any other sensors. To validate data collection, we ran an experiment at the Mt Cotton training facility close to Brisbane and collected Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) messages to analyze them and check whether the speed and acceleration information extracted from them is accurate enough to detect change in speed and braking.

In FFCS systems, customers can pick up and drop off vehicles anywhere in a defined business area. While these systems offer a maximum level of flexibility for the customer, the operator is confronted with spatiotemporal demand asymmetries. In order to offer a reliable mobility product, the operator has to assure a certain level of availability by relocating vehicles. As relocations are associated with costs, the FFCS operator has introduced a special incentive system in Milan. The operating area is two-stage, i.e. it consists of a central business area and a peripheral business area. As the peripheral area is less attractive, the operator offers a bonus minute incentive for cars picked up in the peripheral area and returned in the central area. The second incentive (reduced rates) has no restrictions on where to return the vehicle. The goal of this study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the two different incentives regarding the potential to substitute operator-based transfers. To this end, we analyzed more than 600,000 app calls and more than 80,000 rentals. First, we partitioned the operating area into zones to evaluate their attractiveness. In a second step, the success of the different offer types was assessed by analyzing the influence of incentives on the idle times and comparing the vehicle distribution before and after the rental. As a result, we can confirm that the vehicle distribution is improved which means that customers can be influenced to return a car in a predefined area. The idle time after an incentive is placed is significantly lower than the average idle time in the peripheral area. A definite price sensitivity of the customers cannot be stated with the examined data.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569242","free-floating carsharing;user-based relocation;fleet-rebalancing with incentives","Business;Automobiles;Graphical models;Distribution functions;Urban areas;Spatiotemporal phenomena","automobiles;incentive schemes;mobile computing;rental;spatiotemporal phenomena;traffic engineering computing","Milan;free-floating carsharing concepts;FFCS systems;spatiotemporal demand asymmetries;reliable mobility product;special incentive system;central business area;peripheral business area;bonus minute incentive;operator-based transfers;vehicle distribution","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, ride comfort, which is adversely affected by road anomalies, is a much more pronounced concern for autonomous vehicles where humans are driven (most likely as a paid service) compared to traditional automobiles (being driven by humans). Towards developing efficient and cost-effective solutions for generating timely road situational awareness data, this paper describes a target-tracking formulation that exploits ubiquitous sensing and processing capabilities in modern automobiles. The problem formulation presented in this paper is fundamentally different to the traditional target tracking as voluntarily participating motor-vehicles are used as mobile sensors for detection and tracking in comparison to sensors that actively detect and track targets. A simplified example on initial detection and tracking the evolution of potholes is utilized for illustration of the proposed concept.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569918","","Target tracking;Roads;Radar tracking;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Task analysis;Sensor systems","automobiles;intelligent transportation systems;object detection;road safety;target tracking;traffic engineering computing","autonomous vehicles;target-tracking formulation;enhanced road situational awareness;road networks;adverse road conditions;autonomous driving functionality;intelligent transportation systems;mobile sensors;motor-vehicles;ubiquitous sensing;situational awareness","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, the number of EVs that can be charged can be increased either by physically expanding charging capacity or by better exploiting existing charging capacity. In this paper, we focus on the latter, exploring how advanced EV travel planning systems can be used to better align where and when EV charging happens with where and when charging capacity is available. Our novel travel planner enables EV users to plan their trips and EV charging in a way that meets their needs yet reflects charging availability. The core innovation of our approach is that we take a broader, multidestination perspective to EV travel planning -- this gives our planning system more flexibility and scope for deciding when and where charging should happen and, consequently, enables a better alignment between the need for charging implied by the EV travel and the availability of charging. We evaluate our approach on an agent-based simulation of several medium-scale scenarios based on real-world data. The results confirm the benefits of our multi-destination approach, especially in scenarios in which charging service providers support upfront booking of charging slots.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569385","","Planning;Charging stations;Shortest path problem;Navigation;State of charge;Electric vehicle charging","electric vehicle charging","advanced EV travel planning systems;electrical vehicles;multidestination travel planning;charging slots;charging service providers;multidestination approach;EV charging;EV users","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the large amount of users (i.e., high penetration rate), this unique data-set contains traffic information with a high spatial resolution, a high spatial scope and high reliability. We use the data for 3 purposes. First, an MFD for the city of Amsterdam is constructed, revealing a strong relationship between the average density and the average flow. It also shows that the urban road network never reaches its capacity. Secondly, inhomogeneity is analysed. Traffic is well spread over the network, hence inhomogeneity is low. Moreover, if present, the inhomogeneity has only a minor effect on the flow. Also traffic in different directions is homogeneous. Thirdly, for the first time, an MFD is created for a whole country, which turned out to be very crisp as well. This suggests that small areas or a directional split are not needed to create crisp MFDs. That, in turn, implies that a crisp MFD is not a sufficient condition to apply control without considering internal dynamics.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8570005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8570005","Traffic flow;macroscopic fundamental diagram;urban traffic;traffic congestion;traffic dynamics","Roads;Google;Urban areas;Detectors;Traffic control;Automobiles;Nonhomogeneous media","data handling;Internet;road traffic;traffic information systems","traffic information;urban road network;MFD;floating car data;Amsterdam;Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram;Google traffic Data","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed approach fuses the detection results obtained independently from four main sensors: radar, LiDAR, RGB camera and infrared camera. It generates object region proposals based on the fused detection result. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is used to identify the object categories within these regions.

In this paper, we combine factors related to vehicle and road states, i.e., the vehicle's lateral load transfer, suspension deflection, and curve geographic features, etc. Therefore, an curve speed model based on analyzing the vehicle-road coupling effect for vehicle sideslip and rollover is proposed. Using simulation analysis, the result shows that the average error of the critical speed selected by the proposed model and that by trail and error is 1.55%. By comparing with typical existing models, the curve speed selected by the proposed model is in the range of those selected by others.

A contribution to overcome this issue is presented here. We show a recursive multistage filtering approach with an increased cross-track positioning accuracy, which is decisive to ensure track-selectivity. This is achieved by exploiting track-geometry constraints known in advance, as there are strict rules for the construction of railway tracks. Additionally, compact geometric track-maps can be extracted during the filtering process which are beneficial for existing train localization approaches. The filter was derived applying approximate Bayesian inference. The geometry constraints are directly incorporated in the filter design, utilizing an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter and extended Kalman filters (EKF). Throughout simulations the performance of the filter is analyzed and discussed thereafter.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569456","","Geometry;Rail transportation;Hidden Markov models;Tracking;Bayes methods;Global navigation satellite system;Reliability","Bayes methods;Kalman filters;nonlinear filters;position measurement;railway engineering;railway safety;target tracking","recursive multistage filtering approach;track-selectivity;railway tracks;compact geometric track-maps;filtering process;filter design;interacting multiple model filter;Kalman filters;train-borne localization systems;railway transportation sector;train localization;track-selective information;cross-track positioning accuracy;track-geometry constraints","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the state estimation process for monitoring AV dynamics, in presence of CP attacks, is analyzed and a novel adversarial deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the robustness of AV dynamics control to CP attacks. The attacker's action and the AV's reaction to CP attacks are studied in a game-theoretic framework. In the formulated game, the attacker seeks to inject faulty data to AV sensor readings so as to manipulate the inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing and potentially increase the risk of AV accidents or reduce the vehicle flow on the roads. Meanwhile, the AV, acting as a defender, seeks to minimize the deviations of spacing so as to ensure robustness to the attacker's actions. Since the AV has no information about the attacker's action and due to the infinite possibilities for data value manipulations, each player uses long short term memory (LSTM) blocks to learn the expected spacing deviation resulting from its own action and feeds this deviation to a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Then, the attacker's RL algorithm chooses the action which maximizes the spacing deviation, while the AV's RL algorithm seeks to find the optimal action that minimizes such deviation. Simulation results show that the proposed adversarial deep RL algorithm can improve the robustness of the AV dynamics control as it minimizes the intra-AV spacing deviation.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569635","","Sensors;Heuristic algorithms;Security;Vehicle dynamics;Robustness;Cameras;Radar","control engineering computing;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;neural nets;safety;security of data;state estimation","data value manipulations;adversarial deep RL algorithm;AV dynamics control;intra-AV spacing deviation;autonomous vehicle systems;cyber-physical attacks;CP attacks;game-theoretic framework;AV sensor readings;inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing;AV accidents;adversarial deep reinforcement learning algorithm;state estimation process;long short term memory;LSTM blocks","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM), also known as Cooperative Intersection Management (CIM) is among the more challenging traffic problems that poses important questions related to safety and optimization in terms of delays, fuel consumption, emissions and reliability. Previously we introduced two stop-sign based policies for autonomous intersection management that were compatible with platoons of autonomous vehicles. These policies outperformed regular stop-sign policy both in terms of average delay per vehicle and variance in delay. This paper introduces a reservation-based policy that utilizes the cost functions from our previous work to derive optimal schedules for platoons of vehicles. The proposed policy guarantees safety by not allowing vehicles with conflicting turning movement to be in the conflict zone at the same time. Moreover, a greedy algorithm is designed to search through all possible schedules to pick the best that minimizes a cost function based on a trade-off between total delay and variance in delay.

In this paper, we introduce AMoDeus, an open-source software package for the accurate and quantitative analysis of autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. AMoDeus uses an agent-based transportation simulation framework to simulate arbitrarily configured AMoD systems with static or dynamic demand. It includes standard benchmark algorithms, fleet efficiency and service level analysis methods and a dedicated graphical viewer that allows in-depth insights into the system.

LIDAR points are classified as either belonging to the ground, or not, and RGB images are processed by a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network to obtain semantic labels. The results are fused into an evidential grid to assess the drivability of an area met by an autonomous vehicle, while accounting for incoherences over time and between sensors. The dynamic behaviour of potentially moving objects can be estimated from the high-level semantic labels. LIDAR scans and images are not assumed to be acquired at the same time, making the proposed grid mapping algorithm asynchronous. This approach is justified by the need for coping with, at the same time, sensor uncertainties, incoherences of results over time and between sensors, and the need for handling sensor failure. In classical LIDAR/camera fusion, in which LIDAR scans and images are considered to be acquired at the same time (synchronously), the failure of a single sensor leads to the failure of the whole fusion algorithm. On the contrary, the proposed asynchronous approach can be used to fuse contradictory information over time, while allowing the vehicle to operate even in the event of the failure of a single sensor.

As such functions use the measurements of sensors in order to interpret the driving situation, unavoidable sensor measurement errors have a negative impact on both the safety and the satisfaction of the customer. In this paper, a new methodology for the robust design of an automatic emergency braking (AEB) system considering sensor measurement errors is proposed. Based on a stochastic model, the robust design is formulated as an optimization problem, whose solution results in the optimal values for the parameters of the AEB system, i.e., of both the sensor and the function it is based on, with respect to a probabilistic quality measure. Besides this joint function and sensor design, the robust sensor design for a given function and the robust function design for a given sensor considering sensor measurement errors in case of the AEB system are formulated as optimization problems using the same probabilistic quality measure. An expression for this probabilistic quality measure is derived, and the elaborated theoretical results are illustrated and verified by numerical examples. Moreover, the new design methodology provides the designer with a design space for choosing the parameter values.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569495","","Measurement errors;Brakes;Measurement uncertainty;Safety;Probabilistic logic;Time measurement;Optimization","braking;control engineering computing;driver information systems;measurement errors;optimisation;probability;road safety;stochastic processes","robust design;automatic emergency braking system considering sensor measurement errors;vehicular safety functions;dangerous driving situations;automotive safety;unavoidable sensor measurement errors;optimization problem;AEB system;probabilistic quality measure;joint function;robust sensor design;robust function design;design methodology;design space;sensor measurement errors","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach is based on a time series analysis of travel time data from the UK's National Traffic Information Service (NTIS). Time series of travel times are characterised by a noisy background variation exhibiting the expected daily and weekly patterns punctuated by large spikes associated with congestion events. Some spikes are caused by peak hour congestion and some are caused by unforeseen events like accidents. Our algorithm uses thresholding to split the data into background and spike signals, each of which is analysed separately. The the background signal is extracted using spectral filtering. The periodic part of the spike signal is extracted using locally weighted regression (LWR). The final estimated travel time is obtained by recombining these two. We assess our method by cross-validating in several UK motorways. We use 8 weeks of training data and calculate the error of the resulting travel time estimates for a week of test data, repeating this process 4 times.

Up-to-date information serves as the basis for changing street directions as well as guiding individual vehicles to a fitting parking slot. In this context, not only abstract indicators like traffic flow and density are required, but also data about mobility parameters and class information of individual vehicles. Consequently, accurate and reliable systems that are capable of providing these kinds of information in real-time are highly demanded. In this paper, we present a system for the classification of vehicles based on their radio-fingerprints which applies cutting-edge machine learning models and can be non-intrusively installed into the existing road infrastructure in an ad-hoc manner. In contrast to other approaches, it is able to provide accurate classification results without causing privacy-violations or being vulnerable to challenging weather conditions. Moreover, it is a promising candidate for large-scale city deployments due to its cost-efficient installation and maintenance properties. The proposed system is evaluated in a comprehensive field evaluation campaign within an experimental live deployment on a German highway, where it is able to achieve a binary classification success ratio of more than 99% and an overall accuracy of 89.15% for a fine-grained classification task with nine different classes.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569391","","Radio link;Roads;Machine learning;Attenuation;Magnetoacoustic effects;Magnetometers;Automobiles","intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;road vehicles","real-time vehicle classification;multidimensional radio-fingerprinting;static resources;future vehicular traffic;smart city environments;street directions;fitting parking slot;traffic flow;mobility parameters;class information;accurate systems;reliable systems;radio-fingerprints;cutting-edge machine learning models;accurate classification results;challenging weather conditions;large-scale city deployments;cost-efficient installation;maintenance properties;binary classification success ratio;fine-grained classification task;intelligent transportation systems;ITS;CPS;road infrastructure;up-to-date information;dynamic cyber physical systems","","","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our goal is to trace out, in an image, the projection of road boundaries irrespective of whether or not the boundary is actually visible. Large scale occlusion by vehicles prohibits direct approaches - many scenes present 100% occlusion and so we must infer the boundary location using scene context. Such a problem is well suited to CNN derived approaches but the sinuous structure of a hidden narrow continuous curve running through the image presents challenges for conventional NN-architectures. We approach this as a coupled, two class detection problem-solving for occluded and non-occluded curve partitions with a continuity constraint. Our network output is in a hybrid discrete-continuous form which we interpret as measurements of segments of the true road boundary. These measurements are passed to a model selection stage which associates measurements to minimal number of a-priori unknown set of geometric primitives (cubic curves) representing road boundaries. We present a semi-supervised method which leverages a visual localisation to generate 25 thousand labelled images for training and testing - the results of which are presented in the conclusion of the paper.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569570","","Roads;Three-dimensional displays;Image segmentation;Automobiles;Cameras;Shape;Geometry","convolution;feedforward neural nets;image segmentation;neural net architecture;object detection;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","road boundary;mono-images;boundary location;coupled class detection problem-solving;two class detection problem-solving;nonoccluded curve partitions;labelled images;large scale occlusion;scene context;CNN;NN-architectures","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve this issue, we design a real-time compressive sensing (CS) approach which allows CVs to collect and compress data in real-time and can recover the original data accurately and efficiently when it is necessary. The CS approach is applied to recapture 10 million CV Basic Safety Message speed samples from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment program. With a compression ratio of 0.2, it is found that the CS approach can recover the original speed data with the root mean-squared error as low as 0.05.

Analyzing taxi traffic of Shanghai, San Francisco, and New York City, we have found that the short trips within city are mostly of commuters during office hours and span a specific city area. Now, if the large number of commuters are ready to share their rides, that will have a huge impact on the `super-commute' problem faced in various cities of USA and around the world. While ride-sharing can increase taxi occupancy and profit for drivers and savings for passengers, it reduces the overall on-road traffic and thereby the average commute time and carbon foot-print. While centralized ride-sharing services, like car-pooling, can address the problem to some extent, they lack scalability and power to dynamically adapt the taxi schedule for best results. In this paper, we propose a four-way model for the ride-sharing problem and develop a novel distributed taxi ride sharing (TRS) algorithm to address dynamic scheduling of ride sharing requests. Our algorithm shows the overall reduction in total distance travelled by taxis as a result of ride sharing. Empirical results using large scale taxi GPS traces from Shanghai, China show that TRS algorithm can grossly outperform a Taxi Distance Minimization (TDM) algorithm. TRS accommodates 33% higher ride share among passengers while dealing with 44,241 requests handled by 4,000 taxis on a single day in Shanghai.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569315","Taxi ride sharing;Smart Transportation;Distributed Coordination;Data Analysis;GPS traces","Public transportation;Schedules;Real-time systems;Heuristic algorithms;Vehicle dynamics;Urban areas;Vehicles","data analysis;dynamic scheduling;Global Positioning System;road traffic;traffic information systems;transportation","urban public transportation;Shanghai;San Francisco;New York City;centralized ride-sharing services;taxi schedule;taxi GPS traces;distributed taxi ride sharing;taxi traffic analysis;distributed TRS;data analysis;dynamic scheduling;ride sharing requests","","","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These approaches require an up-to-date map. It seems promising to update such maps iteratively after passing the mapped area again. However, bundling more and more passes into the existing map leads to unbounded computation and memory complexity. Herein we propose an iterative optimization approach to create highly accurate maps comprising any number of drives with constant computation complexity. The optimization bases on keypoint correspondences matched between the recorded images from multiple drives. First, each new drive is reconstructed separately by a sliding window bundle-adjustment. Thereafter, the estimated trajectory is divided into disjoint clusters. To align the new drive to the current map, we optimize pairs of clusters which are interconnected through loop-closure or inter-drive correspondences. We derive pose differences from all clusters to estimate the final map poses. For global accuracy, we add GNSS measurements from a low cost receiver. We show in our experiments that the approach enables a joint estimate of the trajectories and landmarks from numerous city-scaled passes within several hours on desktop computers.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8570011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8570011","","Optimization;Cameras;Trajectory;Global navigation satellite system;Complexity theory;Pipelines;Reliability","iterative methods;robot vision;satellite navigation;SLAM (robots)","sliding window bundle-adjustment;surround view;global navigation satellite systems;iterative optimization approach;vision-based localization;multidrive map optimization","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study's simulator-based experiments investigate the relationship between a driver's emergency behaviors and the information displayed to the driver. In the experiment, the subject participates in simulated autonomous driving where his/her vehicle runs in the center lane of a three-lane highway in a low-visibility (fog) situation. After a 7- to 8-minute drive, the subject encounters an emergency situation where an obstacle vehicle with flashing hazard lamps appears in front of the subject's vehicle. In this situation, only a simple warning sign and an alarm sound are displayed to half of the experiment's subjects. To the remaining haif, directive visual information (an arrow sign) to indicate the steering direction was displayed on a HUD (head-up display) area in addition to the warning sign and alarm sound.

To benefit from these maps, precise localization is necessary. Localization enables the vehicle to drive along planned trajectories using map information like lane geometry and static environment information. State-of-the-art localization methods often use feature based maps or rely on dense appearance based maps for direct, association free matching. In this paper we combine both ideas. We solve the localization problem by matching dense measurement grids from LiDAR sensors directly against a geometrical, feature based map. Reflectivity and occupancy grids are obtained from multiple Li-DAR sensors. In order to avoid information reduction through feature extraction, the low-level grids are registered directly against a high-level geometrical map (Fig. 1). This new concept is solved using an exhaustive search in combination with a multi-level-resolution search. Real-time capable registration is achieved by exploiting the computational power of modern GPUs. To realize an online localizer, a Kalman Filter (KF) fuses the registration results with odometry information, obtained from serial production sensors. To ensure a fixed runtime, the registration resolution is adapted based on the state uncertainty. The robustness and accuracy of the developed methods is evaluated in extensive experiments. The localization proved to be accurate and robust against challenging situations like difficult maneuvers or missing localization features in the map. Thus, our new approach is well suited for autonomous driving applications.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569784","","Sensors;Laser radar;Estimation;Uncertainty;Autonomous vehicles;Robustness;Kalman filters","feature extraction;graphics processing units;image filtering;image fusion;image matching;image registration;image resolution;image sensors;Kalman filters;optical radar;radar imaging;radar receivers;radar resolution;search problems","direct geometrical map;low-level grid map registration;static environment information;feature based maps;direct association free matching;geometrical feature based map;feature extraction;high-level geometrical map;multilevel-resolution search;real-time capable registration;odometry information;serial production sensors;registration resolution;autonomous driving applications;multiple LIDAR sensors;robust online localization methods;dense measurement grid matching;GPU;Kalman filter;KF;exhaustive search","","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These safe zones are provided to a model predictive controller as reference to generate feasible trajectories for a vehicle.

To address it, passenger flow control strategy is widely adopted by developing subway system in order to improve the operational efficiency and ensure passengers' safety. However, current strategy is usually formulated by the subjective experience of operation staff at each station. Their inability to grasp the correlation between station flow and link flow in the entire subway network can possibly cause reverse effect and passengers' dissatisfaction. In this paper, a new coordinated-based passenger flow control method, using the internal relation of stations and links, is proposed to handle this issue during rush-hour of regular weekday with the aim of minimizing the negative impact on irrelevant travelers. Using this approach, one can determine the target control stations with specific control strength in different period of rush-hour.

Inter-driver heterogeneity in calibration parameters has been observed in naturalistic data, but few studies have explored methods to characterize this heterogeneity. This research utilizes an 85-driver sample from the second Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study dataset to calibrate over 100-hours of car-following data to three different car-following models: Gipps, Wiedemann 99, and Intelligent Driver Model. This enables a detailed exploration of the degree to which driver attributes-such as age, gender, and income-can be leveraged to account for inter-driver heterogeneity in car-following. The sample is segmented into smaller subsamples of data as a function of driver attributes. Statistically significant differences in parameter values are observed between the subsamples of data when age, miles driven last year, and income are used as characterizing traits.

In order to investigate the distance to real-world equipment, this work investigates the results of experimentation with commercial devices, in V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) and V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) scenarios. The performance obtained by real on-board and road-side units is then compared to those presented by widely used NS-3 simulator. Three key metrics are evaluated: the maximum range, packet delivery rate (PDR), and packet inter-reception time (PIR). The influence of different modulations defined in IEEE 802.11p and of different mobility levels are analyzed. For both simulation and experimentation, the results agree on the PDR degradation at intense vehicle speeds and higher PHY data rates. Nevertheless, the results in terms of maximum range, moderate speed impact, and the weak correlation between the PIR and PDR show that NS-3 simulation models still need to evolve.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569676","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569676","","Performance evaluation;Standards;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Safety","road safety;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless LAN","traffic safety;control applications;IEEE 802.11p performance evaluation;IEEE 802.11p-compliant devices;V2I;V2V;vehicle-to-vehicle;vehicle-to-infrastructure;packet interreception time;packet delivery rate;NS-3 simulation models","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the presented method, a fully convolutional depth completion network, along with the adversarial network, is designed to find and correct inconsistencies between ground truth distributions and the resulting depth maps interpolated by the depth completion network.

This paper presents a Dynamic Bayesian Network extension for traditional Kalman filters with a technique called state augmentation. Although it has been discussed in the calibration literature, the usage and applicability were not fully investigated. The state augmentation technique is particularly useful for delayed systems, for example in large networks with high travel times. In this paper, we discuss state augmentation for Kalman filtering and illustrate its modeling advantages via a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) representation. These advantages are demonstrated by a case study using the Singapore expressway network. The results indicate that employing state augmentation yields better estimation and prediction accuracy of traffic states, around 10% less error than the standard extended Kalman filter.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569926","time-delay system;OD estimation;constrained extended Kalman filter;calibration;simulation and modeling","Kalman filters;Mathematical model;Calibration;Sensors;Estimation;Bayes methods;Real-time systems","Bayes methods;calibration;Kalman filters;state estimation;traffic control;transportation","DTA systems;online calibration;simulation parameters;Kalman filter;delayed systems;dynamic Bayesian networks;dynamic traffic assignment systems;state augmentation;network state prediction","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One issue has largely gone unnoticed - the adverse effects of motion sickness as induced by self-driving cars. The literature suggests conditionally, highly and fully autonomous vehicles will increase the onset likelihood and severity of motion sickness. Previous research has shown motion sickness can have a significant negative impact on human performance. This paper uses a simulator study design with 51 participants to assess if the scale of motion sickness is a predictor of human performance degradation. This paper finds little proof that subjective motion sickness severity is an effective indicator of the scale of human performance degradation. The performance change of participants with lower subjective motion sickness is mostly statistically indistinguishable from those with higher subjective sickness. Conclusively, those with even acute motion sickness may be just as affected as those with higher sickness, considering human performance. Building on these results, it could indicate motion sickness should be a consideration for understanding user ability to regain control of a self-driving vehicle, even if not feeling subjectively unwell. Effectiveness of subjective scoring is discussed and future research is proposed to help ensure the successful rollout of self-driving vehicles.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569572","","Task analysis;Visualization;Autonomous automobiles;Automation;Automobiles;Ear","automobiles;biomechanics;diseases","self-driving cars;human performance degradation;motion sickness;autonomous vehicle","","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We believe that by taken into account some formerly simplified dynamics, as roll dynamics, we can reduce the estimations' errors, and therefore use simple observers. Co-simulations of the control logic with a high-fidelity vehicle model proved the relevance of this method. Results showed that the vehicle can be controlled in severe conditions while the friction changes using only today's passenger cars sensors.

An intermediate step and cornerstone to this understanding is a precise estimate of a vehicle's pose and category as well as potential other cues that facilitate predicting its future behavior. The output representations of current state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, e.g. detection or semantic segmentation, hold little pose information and generally do not straightforwardly allow for any vehicle state analysis. In this work we focus on new vehicle representations that can be learned by semantic segmentation algorithms. We present three vehicle fragmentation levels that divide a vehicle into part areas based on a mixture of material and function, jointly aiming at vehicle state analysis and embedding pose information. To avoid expensive manual labeling we annotate the representations on CAD models to feed a semi-automated labeling pipeline, requiring 3D bounding box labels and a calibrated camera. We evaluate the fine-grained segmentations on two publicly available datasets demonstrating that current state-of-the-art convolutional networks are capable of learning such complex representations and can, hence, exceed straightforward appearance learning.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569930","","Solid modeling;Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Pipelines;Pose estimation;Wheels;Labeling","CAD;computer vision;image representation;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;traffic engineering computing","fine-grained vehicle representations;autonomous driving;long-term goal;complex traffic scenes;possibly intentions;traffic participants;nonego vehicles;intermediate step;vehicle state analysis;semantic segmentation algorithms;vehicle fragmentation levels;embedding pose information;fine-grained segmentations;complex representations","","","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process for each agent and use a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm to find toll policies that maximize revenue over a finite time horizon. We also propose a local policy search method which explores the continuous action space without the need to discretize tolls. We compare the performance of the distributed control against other heuristics used in practice. Experiments conducted on the test networks show promising results. The proposed algorithm generates 70-86% more revenue than the other heuristics which assume no coordination and produces toll policies which reduce the violation of free flow travel on managed lanes to only 5% of the times. Despite showing lack of convergence within a reasonable computation time, the proposed algorithm generates toll policies which perform better than the existing heuristics and provides a viable alternative for dynamic tolling of managed lanes with multiple toll locations.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569317","","Heuristic algorithms;Pricing;Mathematical model;Markov processes;Function approximation","learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;multi-agent systems;road pricing (tolls);road traffic;traffic engineering computing;transportation","distributed dynamic pricing;managed lanes;toll agent;toll policies;dynamic tolling;multiple toll locations;multiagent reinforcement learning;local policy search;Markov decision process","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Anticipating human activities is an essential capability for any natural and seamless human-robot interaction scenario. To effectively understand and reason about human activities, a smart system needs to have the ability to process sequential/temporal observations that are normally noisy, high dimensional, have long temporal dependencies and have a high frequency (e.g, videos). In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model architecture to classify driver's actions and activities in real-world scenarios of driving a car in different conditions. Sensory data comes from a variety of sources including a driver facing camera (inside camera), a road facing camera (outside camera), GPS and other car related sensors.

The indicators for the physical damage on road surface are good representation for the structural healthiness and the driving comfort, but they do not always measure the traffic safety levels of the pavement. This limitation hinders planning the pavement management scheme ideal in achieving safer driving environment. This study empirically analyzes the relationships between the pavement conditions and accident risk. The pavement conditions are represented by three indicators: rutting depth, IRI and cracking ratio. The accident frequency is modelled based on the Poisson regression analysis. The model estimation results showed that rutting depth could have significant impact in increasing accident risk, particularly in rainy weather, whereas the IRI shows inverse effect. For cracking ratio, the results were not conclusive, but suggested potential influence on accident risk.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569285","road safety;pavement condition;expressway","Accidents;Roads;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface cracks;Meteorology;Safety","cracks;maintenance engineering;planning;regression analysis;risk analysis;road accidents;road building;road traffic;roads","traffic accident risk;road surface survey;physical damage;pavement maintenance;pavement management scheme;statistical analysis;structural healthiness;driving comfort;planning;safer driving environment;rutting depth;IRI;cracking ratio;Poisson regression analysis;rainy weather;rural expressways","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order for them to become a commercially viable solution, it first needs to be understood why a certain behavior is triggered and how and what those networks learn from human-generated driving data to ensure safety. One research direction is to visualize what the network sees by highlighting regions of an image that influence the outcome of the model. In this vein, we propose a generic visualization method using Attention Heatmaps (AHs) to highlight what a given Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learns over time. To do so, we rely on a novel occlusion technique to mask different regions of an input image to observe the effect on a predicted steering signal.

The feedforward element is calculated in a model predictive manner with a cost function focusing on driving performance. Stability of the error dynamic is then guaranteed by the design of the feedback-feedforward controller. The tracking performance of the control system is tested in a realistic simulated scenario where the control system must track an evasive lateral maneuver.

Generally, automotive environment models incorporate multiple different and complementary representations each focusing on specific aspects of traffic scenes such as the drivable terrain, dynamic objects, the lane layout, etc. Considering camera based environment perception, multi-task models offer an efficient approach capable of generating complementary representations in an integrated manner. Towards this objective, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) comprised of a shared encoder stage and specific decoders for road segmentation and object detection. In comparison to exclusive models for each separate task, the redundant computation of common feature maps is avoided resulting in fast inference times even on low cost embedded systems. Furthermore, the detection stage is extended to predict the orientation of detected objects. The orientation estimate guides a consecutive 3D bounding box estimation based on analytic geometry. Thus, the CNN suffices to generate a basic environment model consisting of the spatial information of dynamic objects as well as the free space area obtained from road segmentation.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569822","Computer Vision;Convolutional Neural Networks;Multi-Task Learning;Semantic Segmentation;Object Detection;3D Reconstruction","Decoding;Computer architecture;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Roads;Computational modeling;Object detection","cameras;computer vision;embedded systems;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;image segmentation;object detection;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","3D bounding box estimation;vehicles surroundings;traffic scene understanding;spatial understanding;fast multitask CNN;spatial information;basic environment model;low cost embedded systems;object detection;road segmentation;shared encoder stage;convolutional neural network;camera based environment perception;lane layout;drivable terrain;traffic scenes;complementary representations;automotive environment models;comprehensive environment model","","","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such cases, it might be valuable to assist the driver even after the handover of control, but that might cause mode confusion and over-reliance on the assistance system. Here, we describe a study that tests the effect of driver alert and support systems on driving performance and perceived allocation of responsibility for vehicle safety, after a handover of control from automated driving. Results show that steering support improves lane-keeping performance after a transition of control and does not significantly affect safety in a lane change event.

A novel performance indicator based on the concept of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is developed to assess the travel production of the network. The proposed indicator is obtained by calculating the weighted space-mean flow of an urban network, which is a proxy for the travel production of the corresponding network. The resilience of the road network is defined as its ability to retain the same level of travel production after occurrence of a disruption. This paper shows how real-time traffic control measures can enhance the resilience of the network. More specifically, the impact of re-routing as a real-time traffic management measure is investigated in a network where a link is closed due to an unpredictable incident. The main advantage of this approach in comparison to the existing travel time based approaches is that it neither requires a detailed model of the network nor a calibration of a dynamic traffic assignment model for different demand scenarios, as the MFD is a property of the network and is not sensitive to small changes in demand.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569678","Transportation resilience;macroscopic fundamental diagram;real-time traffic control","Resilience;Real-time systems;Roads;Production;Indexes;Loss measurement","road traffic control","real-time traffic control measures;urban road networks;road network;real-time traffic control applications;performance indicator;macroscopic fundamental diagram;travel production;weighted space-mean flow;urban network;corresponding network;real-time traffic management measure;existing travel time;dynamic traffic assignment model","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to find out how people travel to the public hospitals for their scheduled outpatient appointments particularly before and after the bike-sharing system in Beijing, two interview surveys with a total of 1,047 valid samples were conducted at the Beijing Friendship Hospital in October 2016 and 2017.

Through several parallel microscopic traffic simulations of Chinese contexts considering different road types and penetration rates, we find that these intelligent vehicle technologies can generate noticeable decrease in travel time and increase in travel speed for urban traffic, especially in the morning and evening peak time, but not quite effective on highways and in rural areas. The study also indicates the importance of their market penetration rate to technological effects. Furthermore, based on the characteristics and simulation results of Chinese traffic, we propose some suggestions for developing countries to make better use of these advanced technologies.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569431","Chinese traffic;cooperative adaptive cruise control;intelligent speed adaption;travel time;travel speed;simulation study","Roads;Urban areas;Automotive engineering;Data models;Acceleration;Context modeling","adaptive control;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles","traffic efficiency;highway;rural traffic;parallel microscopic traffic simulations;Chinese contexts;intelligent vehicle technologies;travel time;travel speed;urban traffic;technological effects;simulation results;Chinese traffic;intelligent vehicles;cooperative adaptive cruise control;intelligent speed adaption","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To account for hybrid state spaces and non-linear system dynamics, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are often the inference method of choice. However, in state estimation problems with high uncertainty, SMC methods typically suffer from either high complexity (using many samples) or low accuracy (using an insufficient number of samples). In this paper, we present a multiple model unscented Kalman filter based DBN inference method for driver intention estimation and multi-agent trajectory prediction. This inference method reduces complexity, while still keeping the benefits of sample-based evaluation of non-linear and non-continuous transition models. Firstly, the state of the DBN is approximated as a mixture of Gaussians and estimated over time by tracking the multi-agent system. Secondly, a probabilistic forward simulation of the belief is performed to generate interaction-aware trajectories for all agents and all intention hypotheses. The proposed method is compared to SMC-based inference methods in terms of accuracy, variance and runtime in both simulations and real-world scenarios.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569932","","Trajectory;Estimation;Predictive models;Kalman filters;Vehicles;Complexity theory;Bayes methods","Bayes methods;Kalman filters;Monte Carlo methods;multi-agent systems;nonlinear filters;state estimation","SMC methods;state estimation problems;sequential Monte Carlo methods;hybrid state spaces;dynamic Bayesian networks;multiple model unscented Kalman filtering;SMC-based inference methods;interaction-aware trajectories;multiagent system;noncontinuous transition models;sample-based evaluation;multiagent trajectory prediction;driver intention estimation;DBN inference method;multiple model unscented Kalman filter","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the PGS is completely ineffective when the parking lots missing data or even have no parking data. This paper makes an exploration on data repairing by digging geospatial data and historical data. First, this paper proposes a method to verify the possibility of parking data similarity when parking lots have spatial similarity. Then take the known data of parking lots as samples and generate reparative data through the Recurrent GANs. The experiment shows, when parking lots have similar spatial features, the parking data, in a high probability, have some similarity with each other, too. And the data generated by Recurrent GANs have the same distribution with real data.

In practice, the presence of noise corrupts sensors' ideal performance, causing detection and state estimation of moving objects to be erroneous. These detection errors propagate through the overall system and potentially compromise the reliability and safety of the AV. To get an assurance that the vehicle will operate safely, any simulation platform for an AV must include a realistic representation of the fallacies in vehicle's perception. In this study, the perception error for a vision based detection algorithm of the camera sensor is modeled by applying auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) and nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) method. It will enable statistical error values to be injected into ideal values obtained from simulation models. The proposed approach is evaluated based on several test case scenarios using various environmental and traffic information. A comparative analysis of the behavior of the AV with and without perception error model for the imperfection of camera sensor has been undertaken using the CarMaker platform. The investigation of the impact on the behavior of the AV by the variation of the state (distance, brake-torque) clearly depict the effectiveness of incorporating the error model at detection level in CarMaker.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8570015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8570015","Autonomous Vehicle;Auto-regressive Moving Average;Bounding box offset;CarMaker;Error modeling;Perception error;Sensor imperfection","Sensors;Data models;Time series analysis;Cameras;Analytical models;Predictive models;Testing","autoregressive moving average processes;autoregressive processes;mobile robots;object detection;road traffic;road vehicles;state estimation;traffic engineering computing","dynamic traffic objects;surrounding ground vehicles;AV;noise corrupts sensors;detection errors;simulation platform;vision based detection algorithm;camera sensor;statistical error values;ideal values;simulation models;environmental traffic information;perception error model;detection level;autonomous vehicle","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using common GNSS the ego position can be measured but not with the reliability and precision necessary. An alternative approach to achieve precise localization is the usage of visual landmarks observed by a camera mounted in the vehicle. However, this raises the necessity of reliable visual landmarks that are easily recognizable and persistent. We propose a novel SLAM algorithm that focuses on learning and mapping such visual long-term landmarks (LLamas). The algorithm therefore processes stereo image streams from several recording sessions in the same spatial area. The key part within LLama-SLAM is the assessment of the landmarks with quality values that are inferred as viewpoint dependent probabilities from observation statistics. By adding solely landmarks of high quality to the final LLama Map, it can be kept compact while still allowing reliable localization. Due to the long-term evaluation of the GNSS measurement during the sessions, the landmarks can be positioned precisely in a global referenced coordinate system. For a first assessment of the algorithm's capabilities, we present some experimental results from the mapping process combining three sessions recorded over two months on the same route.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569323","","Cameras;Visualization;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Global navigation satellite system;Reliability;Probability;Optimization","control engineering computing;driver information systems;mobile robots;probability;road traffic control;robot vision;SLAM (robots);statistics;stereo image processing","LLama-SLAM;autonomous driving;stereo image streams;GNSS measurement;statistics;high-quality visual landmark learning;long-term mapping and localization;GNSS;visual long-term landmarks;r advanced driver assistance systems","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed mutlimodal system is a generalization of the existing Uber ExpressPool service. The goal of this paper is to test empirically the feasibility of the proposed multimodal system. We accomplish this goal with the aid of time-stamped taxi origin/destination data from New York City. The analysis has two steps: network design and trip assignment. First, we identify 17 carpool hub locations with a coverage of 1 km to capture all taxi trip demand within Manhattan during peak hours. After designing the network, we then assign trips to carpools, within each hub, that have similar trip start times and destinations. We formulate the assignment problem as an offline matching algorithm on a bipartite graph. We found that over 80 percent of all trips can be assigned to carpools at almost all hubs. Compared to a single-modal system, the multimodal system served the same number of passengers with 40 percent fewer taxis. We found the matching rate to be consistent for every month in 2015. These results provide initial evidence that multimodal connections between ride-hailing and dockless bikesharing are feasible, reduces passenger trip times, and decreases road congestion.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569896","","Public transportation;Vehicles;Urban areas;Pollution;Frequency modulation;Switches","automobiles;graph theory;network theory (graphs);road traffic;transportation","Uber ExpressPool service;time-stamped taxi origin-destination data;offline matching algorithm;bipartite graph;road congestion;dockless bikesharing services;ride-hailing services;meteoric rise;empirical study;passenger trip times;multimodal connections;single-modal system;assignment problem;taxi trip demand;trip assignment;network design;New York City","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Humans however do not like to be dominated by automated systems. Hence, the question arises on how an automated system should react if a cooperation would be possible. In order to investigate this, we designed an assistance system that could trigger requests for cooperation in merging scenarios and perform different maneuvers (lane-change or braking) depending on the traffic situation. It provided the participant with sufficient time to either accept or decline incoming requests and when no active choice was made, a default reaction (either cooperative behavior, uncooperative behavior or triggering a take-over request) was shown by the system. Results in terms of cooperation rate and system acceptance indicate that the automation should either behave cooperatively or uncooperatively with a slight favor for cooperative behavior.

It allows to get precise object locations and shapes from camera images. In this paper, we propose an approach to instance segmentation based on deep learning. A convolutional neural network predicts relations between neighbour pixels. It also predicts which regions of the image lie inside instances. This representation is then decoded to get the object instances. Our approach achieves an average precision of 13.9 % over all classes on the validation dataset of the challenging Cityscapes benchmark. In contrast to other encoding based approaches, the presented approach can associate freestanding (unconnected) areas of the same instance. This problem can arise if an object is partially occluded. It is solved by learning long-range neighbour relations that do not only consider direct neighbour pixels. We show that these long-range neighbour relations result in higher accuracies for all classes.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569291","","Image segmentation;Semantics;Encoding;Convolutional neural networks;Cameras;Task analysis","convolution;feedforward neural nets;image segmentation;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);traffic engineering computing","instance segmentation;pixel neighbour relations;camera images;deep learning;convolutional neural network;object instances;encoding based approaches;long-range neighbour relations;direct neighbour pixels;CNN;automated vehicles;object locations","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This framework consists of five steps: vehicle trajectories reconstruction, object road handover sequence generation, vehicle trajectories matching, similarity measurement and traffic speed estimation. First, we analyzed the location update theory to reconstruct vehicle trajectories and generate object road handover sequences. Then, we proposed a vehicle trajectories matching method under the inspiration of longest common subsequence and designed a similarity measurement algorithm that satisfies the specific condition.

Due to its safety-critical nature and complicated circumstance, train control system is a typical large-scale and complex system. To address the serious challenge of route safety verification in the system development, this paper proposes a novel method by integrating the function model and the fail-safe fault model of train control. According to the fail-safe principle of railway signaling, with the help of Scade formalism, route safety properties are expressed into a fault tree. The two models are investigated for compatibility and, interlinkage constrains are discussed. Then integration rules are defined to combine the fault tree model and the function model into one lumping model, on which the safety verification is performed using Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). To illustrate how to apply the approach, examples are carried out on a part of WuGuang high-speed railway line in China.

We propose to use unsupervised machine learning to train neural networks to solve the modeling problem. The models learn a small set of intuitive parameters without the need for labeled data and use them to generate new realistic trajectories. The neural networks, which base on the InfoGAN and beta-VAE architectures, are adapted from the image domain to the time series domain. Although our methods are generally applicable, our experiments focus on lane change maneuvers on highways. To train the networks, we use more than 5600 measured lane change trajectories extracted from the highD dataset. Our results show that the networks learn to describe lane change maneuvers by up to four intuitive parameters. Furthermore, the networks are able to map existing lane change trajectories to values of the learned parameters and generate new, previously unseen, realistic trajectories.

Thus, we propose to utilize a surround view camera system becoming popular by making it into stereo vision which is robust for the pedestrian recognition. However, conventional stereo camera technologies cannot be applied due to fisheye cameras and uncalibrated camera poses. Thus we have created the new method to absorb difference of the pedestrian appearance between cameras by machine learning for the stereo vision. The method of stereo matching between image patches in each camera image was designed by combining D-Brief and NCC with SVM. Good generalization performance was achieved by it compared with individual conventional algorithms. Furthermore, feature amounts of the point cloud reconstructed by the stereo pairs are utilized with Random Forest to discriminate pedestrians. The algorithm was evaluated for the actual camera images of crossing pedestrians at various intersections, and 96.0% of pedestrian tracking rate with high position detection accuracy was achieved. They were compared with Faster R-CNN as the best pattern recognition technique, and our proposed method indicated better detection performance.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569716","","Cameras;Turning;Distortion;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Accidents;Feature extraction","cameras;image matching;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;object tracking;pedestrians;stereo image processing;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing","machine learning-based stereo vision algorithm;surround view fisheye cameras;automated emergency brake systems;crossing pedestrians;surround view camera system;pedestrian recognition;uncalibrated camera;pedestrian appearance;stereo matching;image patches;camera image;stereo pairs;pedestrian tracking rate;high position detection accuracy;detection performance;stereo camera technologies;D-Brief;SVM;random forest","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, a specific testing fleet is employed to gather the driving data. Nevertheless, driving data can nowadays also be gathered from regular production cars, as they are already equipped with the required sensors. This approach would be more real-driving representative and cost efficient, but on the other side imposes new challenges. In particular, gathered driving data has to be handled efficiently and the privacy of individuals must be guaranteed.

However, some issues in their implementations remain open, most notably the issue of rebalancing non-occupied vehicles to meet geographically uneven demand, as is, for example, the case during the rush hour. This is somewhat alleviated by the prospect of autonomous mobility-on-demand systems, where autonomous vehicles can relocate themselves; however, the proposed relocation strategies are still centralized and assume all vehicles are a part of the same fleet. Furthermore, ride-sharing is not considered, which also has an impact on rebalancing, as already occupied vehicles can also potentially be available to serve new requests simultaneously. In this paper we propose a reinforcement learning-based decentralized approach to vehicle relocation as well as ride request assignment in shared mobility-on-demand systems. Each vehicle autonomously learns its behaviour, which includes both rebalancing and selecting which requests to serve, based on its local current and observed historical demand. We evaluate the approach using data on taxi use in New York City, first serving a single request by a vehicle at a time, and then introduce ride-sharing to evaluate its impact on the learnt rebalancing and assignment behaviour.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569608","","Autonomous vehicles;Automobiles;Vehicle dynamics;Public transportation;Urban areas;Decision making","cloud computing;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);location based services;mobile robots;multi-agent systems;road vehicles;transportation","autonomous vehicles;relocation strategies;vehicle relocation;ride request assignment;shared mobility-on-demand systems;autonomous mobility-on-demand;decentralized reinforcement learning;urban mobility;decentralized RL-based multiagent approach;intelligent agent","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed robust-control-based (RC) generic transfer architecture, which we call RL-RC, incorporates a transferable hierarchical RL trajectory planner and a robust tracking controller based on disturbance observer (DOB). The deep RL policies trained with known nominal dynamics model are transferred directly to the target domain, DOB-based robust tracking control is applied to tackle the modeling gap including the vehicle dynamics errors and the external disturbances such as side forces.

Stakeholders, including government agencies, industry, and local populations, all have an interest in efficient outcomes, yet there are few tools for developing a holistic understanding of urban dynamics. Simulating large-scale, high-fidelity transportation systems can help, but remains a challenging task, due to the computational demand of processing massive numbers of events and the nonlinear interactions between system components and traveling agents. In this paper, we introduce Mobiliti, a proof-of-concept, scalable transportation system simulator that implements parallel discrete event simulation on high-performance computers. We instantiated millions of nodes, links, and agents to simulate the movement of the population through the San Francisco Bay Area road network and provide estimates of the associated congestion, energy usage, and productivity loss. Our preliminary results show excellent scalability on multiple compute nodes for statically-routed agents, simulating 9.5 million trip legs over a road network with 1.1 million nodes and 2.2 million links, processing 2.4 billion events in less than 30 seconds using 1,024 cores on NERSC's Cori computer.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569397","large-scale transportation simulation;agent-based modeling;high-performance computing;parallel discrete event simulation","Message systems;Computational modeling;Parallel processing;Discrete event simulation;Synchronization;Roads","discrete event simulation;parallel processing;traffic engineering computing;transportation","high-fidelity transportation systems;Mobiliti;high-performance computers;San Francisco Bay Area road network;energy usage;productivity loss;scalable transportation simulation;Cori computer;high-performance parallel computing;NERSC;parallel discrete event simulation;time 30.0 s","","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conflict resolution between vehicles is almost exclusively exercised at the intersections, which turns them into bottlenecks of our urban traffic systems. The recent conflict resolution concepts, that use a reservation-based scheduling approach, improve the efficiency but do not attack the core of the problem. This paper proposes a fundamentally different approach where directional driving paths are altered between neighboring lanes to align vehicles for conflict-less left and right turns at the intersections. Conflicts of the through vehicles are still handled by a reservation-based algorithm. The experiments are executed in FAUSIM - a new simulation tool specially developed to allow flexibility of driving behavior that cannot be found in other tools. The proposed scenario, (called CADLARIC-Combined Alternate-Direction Lane Assignment and Reservation-based Intersection Control) was compared to a conventional Fixed-Time (FT) signals and a novel Fully Reservation-Based Intersection Control (FR-BIC). The results of the experiments, executed on a small three-intersection corridor, show that CADLARIC significantly outperforms the other scenarios in terms of traffic efficiency (delays and stops) and generates a net reduction of conflicting situations when compared to the FR-BIC.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569755","traffic control;simulation;scheduling;conflict resolution;alternate directional driving","Roads;Computational modeling;Tools;Delays;Geometry;Vehicle dynamics;Automobiles","road traffic;road traffic control;scheduling;traffic engineering computing","traffic flows;urban networks;urban intersections;urban traffic systems;recent conflict resolution concepts;fundamentally different approach;directional driving paths;reservation-based algorithm;three-intersection corridor;conflicting situations;fully reservation-based intersection control;CADLARIC;combined alternate-direction lane assignment and reservation-based intersection control;FR-BIC","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Context-aware and multi-objective re-routing approaches will play an important role in traffic management. Yet, most approaches are deterministic and can not support the strict requirements of traffic management applications, since many vehicles potentially will take the same route, consequently degrading overall traffic efficiency. In this way, this work introduces an efficient algorithm based on Pareto-optimality for dealing with such problem. In addition, we focus on the improvement of traffic mobility and public safety during the route recommendation.

The paper presents insights for the assessment of rule based traffic control at motorway merges. The methodology is then applied to a case study wherein an advisory system using rule based control for motorway merges considering mixed traffic is evaluated. With the aim to reduce travel times at merging sections, advices from the control system influencing the longitudinal behavior of mainline vehicles were generated. The advisory system was tested in a microsimulation tool for various penetration rates of controlled vehicles on the mainline. The effect of implementing the control action, side-effects of the design, risks involved and the overall role in improving or deteriorating the merging situation are then discussed.

Modeling the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [1] allows the algorithm to consider these uncertainties in the decision process, which makes it more robust to real sensor characteristics. However, solving the POMDP with reinforcement learning (RL) [2] often requires storing a large number of observations. Furthermore, for continuous action spaces, the system is computationally inefficient. This paper addresses these problems by proposing to model the problem as an MDP and learn a policy with RL using hierarchical options (HOMDP). The suggested algorithm can store the state-action pairs and only uses current observations to solve a POMDP problem.

However, the comfort perspective has still hardly been investigated, despite its importance for the future of driving automation. This paper proposes a driving style classification method, focused on global comfort of the driver and the passengers, but which can also be integrated into the above safety-efficiency viewpoint. Although human comfort in vehicles is affected by different factors, the amplitude and frequency of accelerations are recognized as key signals for assessing driving comfort. The proposed DS classification approach is based on a hybrid machine learning method that combines an unsupervised clustering method with a data-driven extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. Hierarchical clustering is used to explore the relevance of the acceleration components in relation to ride comfort, while a single layer ELM topology is implemented to model the DS classifier. The method has been evaluated using experimental data obtained with an instrumented car equipped with in-vehicle sensors and measurement units. The obtained clustering results are consistent with comfort standard indicators, while the data-driven algorithm provides encouraging results: more than 95 % classification rate using unseen data.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569722","","Machine learning algorithms;Acceleration;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning;Vibrations;Automobiles","driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering","ride comfort;advanced driver assistance systems;automated vehicles;driving safety;fuel efficiency;comfort perspective;driving automation;driving style classification method;driving comfort;DS classification approach;hybrid machine learning method;unsupervised clustering method;data-driven extreme learning machine algorithm;single layer ELM topology;DS classifier;data-driven algorithm;driving style recognition;hybrid machine learning algorithm;driving style characterization","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and is solved by applying reinforcement learning (RL). The RL charging policy (RLCP), found after solving the POMDP, is compared to two benchmark policies and it is shown that RLCP outperforms both.

Meanwhile, fully automated vehicles aim at not requiring human intervention for their safely operation. The industry is currently debating how these novel systems can be certified under functional safety standards. In this paper, we argue that the current safety picture is not comprehensive enough, since it alienates users. We propose experiential safety as a complement to existing functional safety and to develop a framework for experiential safety interactions between the user and automation in automated driving environments. To support the experiential safety design model, we provide an overview of the user-centered research on experiential automation safety, which includes results from online surveys, personal interviews, and gamified group workshops. We explore current user behaviors by focusing on what makes them feel safe as drivers and passengers, and how unexpected events and automation responses might impact their perception of safety. Among the highlighted results, we show how mismatched expectations and unexpected behaviors from autonomous vehicles can lead to frustration and compromised trust. We also show how automation feedback to the user can generate stress and anxiety if not properly configured and how a cooperative relationship between automation and the driver leads to more satisfying driving experiences. Finally, we present guidelines for the experiential safety to be applied by automotive engineers and designers in their development of automated driving technologies.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569686","Automated Driving;Experiential Safety;User experience design;design research;design theory;design science;methodology design;emerging technology","Safety;Automation;Interviews;Automobiles;Guidelines;Task analysis","driver information systems;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles","automated driving systems;automated driving technologies;automation feedback;autonomous vehicles;experiential automation safety;user-centered research;experiential safety design model;automated driving environments;experiential safety interactions;functional safety standards;fully automated vehicles;automated driving technology interactions;experiential safety framework","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a prediction method, named FLOPS, that can keep the characteristics of data change in the long time-span. This method uses the idea of fuzzy information granulation (FIG) to obtain the feature data sets. Then a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is trained to predict the future feature data set. Finally working with the spline interpolation, the predicted feature data set is to reconstruct the full continuous curve of the available parking spaces in the time-span.

They self-organize to give or take right-of-way without being regulated by explicit traffic rules. The safety based on their behavior patterns in such areas is, hence, critical and needs to be fully investigated. In this paper, we first carry out a collision probability method based on safety distance to quantitatively study behavior patterns in mixed traffic. Then we propose a Long Short-Term Memories recurrent neural networks model that takes 2D trajectory data at discrete time steps and incorporates collision probability that captures user behavior patterns as a density mapping function for trajectory prediction. The model handles collisions explicitly based on the relative positions of the neighboring users in an ego user's vicinity with considering the impact of personal space and vehicle geometry. It also provides a friend flock detection mechanism to allow close interactions between friends. After training by real-world trajectories, the model outputs comparative results to the state-of-the-art methods for predicting three-second trajectories in complicated situations in a shared space. It can be applied for intent detection and on-board alarming system for autonomous driving when interacting with multimodal road users in shared spaces.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569757","","Roads;Safety;Trajectory;Space vehicles;Geometry;Force;Mathematical model","probability;recurrent neural nets;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","shared space;vulnerable road users;collision probability method;safety distance;Long Short-Term Memories;2D trajectory data;density mapping function;trajectory prediction;personal space;vehicle geometry;multimodal road users;traffic rules;recurrent neural networks model;user behavior patterns;mixed traffic modeling;LSTM;probability density mapping;on-board alarming system;autonomous driving","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the requirement of higher transmission rate and the tendency of denser deployment of roadside infrastructure, the ultra-dense network (UDN) is proposed to enhance the throughput performance of 5G vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks. In order to relieve the interference resulting from the densification of V2I networks, we introduce a vehicle-centric cooperative transmission scheme and a distance-based resource reuse mechanism. The former takes the vehicle at the center and associates it with several cooperative road side units (RSUs), so as to eliminate the cell edge effect in conventional cell-centric network and avoid intra-cell interference. The latter restricts the resource reuse distance between vehicles in order to mitigate inter-cell interference. In this paper, we provide an analytical 1-D system model, and derive the exact tractable expressions of the two throughput metrics based on stochastic geometry. Moreover, analytical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, our numerical results reveal the relationship between the two throughput metrics and the major performance-impacting parameters, which has a certain guidance for designing ultra-dense V2I networks.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569582","V2I;ultra-dense network;throughput analysis","Throughput;Interference;5G mobile communication;Analytical models;Measurement","cellular radio;cooperative communication;interference suppression;Monte Carlo methods;next generation networks;radiofrequency interference;vehicular ad hoc networks","intelligent transportation system;higher transmission rate;roadside infrastructure;ultra-dense network;vehicle-to-infrastructure;transmission scheme;distance-based resource reuse mechanism;cell edge effect;vehicular applications;communication system;V2I;vehicle-centric;throughput analysis;1-D system model;inter-cell interference;resource reuse distance;intra-cell interference","","1","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This allows to reduce the number of travels and, consequently, users' costs and the environmental impact on the territory. The proposed approach is based on the ride-sharing and crowd-shipping concepts which appear to be highly effective and promising in order to reduce the number of circulating vehicles. In addition, crowd-shipping can also contribute to the spread of the physical internet paradigm, intended as the possibility of splitting freights into smaller standardized boxes and parcels, routing them through alternative paths, and re-assembling them at destination, in analogy to data packets in the digital internet.

The experiments demonstrated that our proposed method embedded the driving behavior data into a two-dimensional, topological map where extracted elemental driving behaviors are represented as clusters. Individual driving episodes can be compactly represented as estimated probabilistic distributions of elemental driving behaviors over the learned map.

While previous studies focused on the association between vehicle dynamics and passenger discomfort, we demonstrate here how we can improve the classification ability of passenger discomfort by employing a multi-dimensional model that also takes into account the external scenario (contextual information).

Using this technology, vehicles extract the information of objects in their surroundings, and share it with others via DSRC V2V communication. Shared information will assist the receiving vehicles in creating extended view of their surroundings. Shared information should contain the min set of attributes that best describe the shared object. It should also be descriptive enough to provide the necessary information to fulfill safety/non-safety applications requirements. The set should contain positional, motion and dimensional information. Accurate positional and dimensional information are not easily extractable in all driving scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach integrated to the object tracking system, and capable of classifying and extracting 3D information of the objects considered for sharing.

With accurate and reliable incident detection, a wide range of environmental and economic benefits can be realised by mitigating congestion quickly. This paper proposes a deep learning method, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for automatic detection of traffic incidents in urban networks by using traffic flow data. The method was evaluated using traffic flow and incident datasets from Central London. Performance indexes, such as False Positive Rate, Detection Rate, Precision and F-measurement, are used to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with a conventional machine learning method, i.e., Multi-Layer Perceptron. The results demonstrate that the proposed method may be superior to traditional neural networks with a higher Detection Rate and a lower False Positive Rate.

Spatiotemporal diagrams of mixed traffic flow were presented to show the effect of CAVs on damping the stop-and-go traffic flow. Results show that with the increase in CAV penetration rate, the portion of smooth driving is increased. Velocity difference between vehicles is decreased and traffic flow is greatly smoothed. Stop-and-go traffic will be greatly eased when CAV penetration rate reaches a rate of 40%~50%. More cautious following strategy of the CAV would contribute to a greater benefit on traffic safety.

The effect of fatigue on the take-over performance was examined in a driving simulator study with 47 participants assigned to two conditions: fatigued or alert. In the corresponding condition (fatigued or alert), the desired driver state was promoted by specific measures (e.g, daytime, caffeinated beverages, physical exercise). In the fatigued condition, the take-over situation was triggered once participants reached a certain high level of fatigue. Two trained, independent observer assessed fatigue with the support of a technical fatigue assessment system based on objective eyelid-closure metrics (e.g, PERCLOS). In the alert condition, participants drove conditionally automated for a fixed 5-minute period. Results showed no significant difference between participants' take-over times in the two conditions. However, fatigued participants were significantly more burdened and stressed during the take-over situation than were alert participants and manifested less confident behavior when coping with the situation. This behavior may negatively affect the transition from conditionally automated driving to manual driving in more complex situations and merits further examination.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569545","fatigue;conditionally automated driving;takeover performance","Fatigue;Vehicles;Observers;Roads;Sleep;Automation;Ergonomics","driver information systems;fatigue;human factors;road safety;traffic engineering computing","conditionally automated driving;manual driving;driving simulator study;corresponding condition;fatigued condition;trained observer assessed fatigue;independent observer assessed fatigue;technical fatigue assessment system;alert condition;fatigued participants","","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many studies have investigated and confirmed that imperfect human reactions and heterogeneous behavior impacts traffic flow. Historically, the findings from these studies have been limited in scope due to a lack of high quality trajectory-level driving data needed to develop, calibrate, and validate behavioral models. Despite the recent introduction of new data sources, such as those acquired through naturalistic driving studies (NDS), the scope of research questions have remained minimal due to substantial requirements for data processing. Therefore, to improve the usability of trajectory-level data, this paper contributes two algorithms for systematic data processing. The first algorithm identifies continuous segments with homogeneous driving states. The second algorithm estimates the event that caused a transition between two driving segments. The algorithms were developed using the SHRP2 NDS database; however, the logic is extendable to data collected from other instrumented vehicles. Verification produced 96% accuracy in predicting driving state and 92% accuracy in predicting state transition events. These algorithms are expected to increase the efficiency and reliability of radar data processing to enable research with a broader scope to inform practical decision-making.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569688","naturalistic driving studies (NDS);trajectory-level instrumented research vehicle (IRV) data;driver behavior","Vehicles;Lead;Radar;Data processing;Prediction algorithms;Reliability","behavioural sciences computing;decision making;driver information systems;radar computing;road safety;road traffic;traffic information systems","radar-vision algorithms;SHRP2 naturalistic driving study;driver behavior;roadway capacity;transportation network;traffic flow;naturalistic driving studies;driving state;state transition events;radar data processing;SHRP2 NDS database","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ability to predict the risk of traffic accident is important in the prevention of the occurrence of accidents and to reduce the damages caused by accidents in a proactive way. However, traffic accident risk prediction with high spatiotemporal resolution is difficult, mainly due to the complex traffic environment, human behavior, and lack of real-time traffic-related data. Based on the quantitative analysis of big traffic accident data, this paper first introduced an important characteristic of traffic accidents - the spatiotemporal correlation, and then constructed a high accurate deep learning model for traffic accident risk prediction based on spatiotemporal correlation pattern.

Multivariate kernel density estimation and kullback-leibler divergence are utilized to compare the acceleration distribution of each driver between datasets which consist of the different amount of data. It is found that 95% drivers can achieve convergent distributions within 200×104 driving data. Secondly, 200×104 driving data of each driver are selected to obtain the acceleration distributions of different drivers. The common acceleration distribution characteristics include: (1) the acceleration distributions of all the drivers follow the so-called dual triangle distribution; (2) the 1st percentile contour interior areas of all the drivers resemble each other and are an approximately diamond shape. The personalized acceleration distribution characteristics include: (1) the 1st percentile contour exterior areas of each driver have many differences, which means that the distribution area and distribution shape differ from driver to driver; (2) the distribution area is strong linearly correlated to the maximum lateral acceleration, and the distribution shape is correlated to the distribution area.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569942","naturalistic driving studies;acceleration distribution;kernel density estimation;kullback-leibler divergence","Acceleration;Kernel;Intelligent vehicles;Estimation;Databases;Bandwidth","data handling;driver information systems;estimation theory;road vehicles;statistical distributions","personalized acceleration distribution characteristic;human driver;convergent acceleration distribution;convergent distributions;dual triangle distribution;lateral acceleration;China-FOT;driving data;multivariate kernel density estimation","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to estimate and track the driver's focus of attention over time in a dynamic automotive scene, a Multi-Hypothesis Multi-Model probabilistic tracking framework was developed in which we postulate consistency between machine and human perception during gaze fixations. Within this framework, we explicitly included target object motion in the spatial transition step and integrated spatiotemporal models of human-like gaze behavior for fixations and saccades in the motion transition. This elaborate design makes the target estimation robust and yet flexible. At the same time, the representation in continuous 2D coordinates makes the algorithm run in real time on a standard laptop. By incorporating dynamic and static potential gaze targets from an object list and a free space spline, the algorithm is in principle independent from the applied sensor setup.

In this paper, we apply this concept to high-capacity buses in a population-dense environment. We first develop a simulator that uses a modified insertion algorithm to model the dynamic routing of such vehicles. Using Singapore as a case study, we demonstrate that dynamically routed buses are an efficient mode of mass transport, and in some cases may hold significant advantages over present-day fixed-route services.

Radar sensors are cost-efficient and thus often used for kinematic object tracking. Current techniques for the utilization of high-resolution radar sensors for object extent estimation, usually model the spatial occurrence of radar detections using statistical approximations. Although providing fast calculation speeds, the obtainable accuracy is not sufficient, especially when low-cost hardware is used. In this work, we propose a radar model which is based on approximations of every functional abstraction layer of radar sensors, from the electromagnetic wave distribution to the digital signal processing. This approach allows an inherent and generic modeling of the spatial detection probability of the environment, regardless of its exact content and avoiding any complexity issues. Consequently, the interaction between measurements of multiple vehicles can be accurately modeled. Additionally, various details like the antenna diagram and underbody reflections are included.

The use of an optimization method is able to generate a collision-free and smooth path. However, its high computation burden limits its direct application to online path planning. This paper proposed a time-efficient online table-lookup approach to deal with this dilemma. Given discrete target points, this approach is capable to form a quintic-spline path with second-order geometric (G<sup>2</sup>-) continuity using a look-up table. The look-up table was generated beforehand in the reference space with minimization on curvature variation. The paper demonstrates the application of this online approach in collision avoidance, with a geometry-based method to decide new target points when obstacles are detected in the original path. These new target points are fed to the table-lookup online path planning algorithm to generate a collision-free path with minimum curvature variation.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569981","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569981","","Optimization;Path planning;Interpolation;Table lookup;Collision avoidance;Task analysis;Complexity theory","collision avoidance;geometry;minimisation;mobile robots;road vehicles;splines (mathematics);table lookup","obstacle avoidance;time-efficient online table-lookup;second-order geometric continuity;obstacle detection;autonomous driving;look-up table;quintic-spline path;automated driving;online quintic path planning;minimum curvature variation;collision-free path;collision avoidance","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate usage prediction is necessary to support timely reposition and ensure availability. Existing prediction methods of bike-sharing usage are mostly based on its own history. They can capture temporal characteristics under normal state but cannot respond to sudden events. Bike-sharing is a part of public transport. The interrelation of bike-sharing and other public transport systems can be utilized to capture the impact of sudden events. This prediction approach considers both historical usage and real-time passengers of public transport. Then use neural networks to establish the connection among them. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is adopted because it shows outstanding performance to learn long-term temporal dependencies. Experiments show that the prediction through this approach is more accurate than baselines. The mean absolute error (MAE) reduces by 25.32% to 39.82%. With the input of real-time boarding passengers, the prediction better responds to sudden changes, and the MAE value further reduces by 21.81%. This approach also outperforms others in different prediction horizons. Moreover, the methodology is applicable to both traditional and station-free bike-sharing systems. Data for the prediction are available in many cities, and hence it is ready for practice.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569726","hike-sharing;usage;prediction;long short-term memory (LSTM);public transport","Market research;Logic gates;Real-time systems;Recurrent neural networks;Roads;Bicycles","bicycles;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;traffic engineering computing;transportation","bike-sharing usage;LSTM approach;prediction methods;public transport systems;prediction approach;historical usage;long-term temporal dependencies;real-time boarding passengers;traditional station-free bike-sharing;long short-term memory;short-term prediction;mean absolute error","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Integrating state-dependent regional travel time function as an endogenous time-varying delay, the MFD model with time delay, is adopted to describe the traffic dynamics within a region.

A routing steering mechanism is suggested, where we homogenize the traffic distribution by selectively disseminating information about the unavailability of certain roads, based on simulated outcomes of their closing. We demonstrate that the full removal of some road segments from the network can redistribute traffic in a socially beneficial way. We identify the most harmful roads and quantify their negative effect on the system. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of soft closing. Instead of informing the whole population to avoid a certain road, we inform only a portion of the drivers, further improving the network utilization.

However, electric vehicles are still pricier compared to vehicles with conventional powertrains. Incentives that promote vehicle electrification for cleaner and more sustainable urban mobility should rely on a holistic cost analysis that considers the life cycle costs of different vehicle technologies. This paper presents a method that estimates the direct Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for different electric vehicle powertrains. The TCO, which include direct and indirect costs, is estimated for three representative urban light duty vehicles: Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), Electric Vehicle (EV), and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). The TCO includes the present value of: 1) Vehicle retail cost including tax, 2) Lifetime operation cost from the time of vehicle purchase to the time of scrapping, including fueling, maintenance, taxes, insurance, registration and licensing costs, 3) Battery replacement cost, and 4) Time cost. Battery life expectancy is estimated by considering wear data. The results, which are based on vehicle technology characteristics and driver behavior, showed that the TCO for United States, showed that the TCO for EV and PHEV is higher by 24% and 36%, respectively, compared to the HEV.

For prediction, we adopt a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN) model. The approach is tested using real-world traffic data collected during hurricane Irma's evacuation for the interstate 75 (I-75), a major evacuation route in Florida. Using LSTM-NN, we perform several experiments for predicting speeds for 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min ahead of current time. The results are compared against other traditional prediction models such as KNN, ANN, ARIMA. We find that LSTM-NN performs better than these parametric and non-parametric models.

When applied to security applications, like predicting pedestrian paths for risk assessment, a point-wise greedy evaluation of the output pdf is not feasible, since the environment often allows multiple choices. Therefore, a robust risk assessment has to take all options into account, even if they are overall not very likely. Towards this end, a combination of particle filtering strategies and a LSTM-MDL model is proposed to address a multimodal path prediction task.

The problem is relevant in the context of modern Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. More specifically, we address the task to continuously generate a predicted longitudinal velocity profile with a fixed time horizon and associated with a driver's intention (e.g. overtake). The objective is to obtain a “general purpose” prediction, aimed to feed any ADAS algorithm requiring future longitudinal velocity and intention informations, like safety applications, warning systems or MPC-based algorithms. The prediction makes use of the artificial co-driver concept, which is here designed to deal with longitudinal inputs only. The co-driver is an agent able to perform inference of intention by means of a mirroring approach, trying to imitate the human driving behavior. The approach is conceived to be simple and modular, using only longitudinal informations from the vehicle, and flexible to the availability of external informations (e.g. vehicle ahead). The works includes the implementation of a jerk filtering technique proposed by some of the authors, this technique is used in a mirroring approach for the first time.

In this paper we investigate the impact of utility-based dynamic pricing for Autonomous TNCs (ATNCs) in one-sided markets. We test the method using an Agent-Based Model (ABM) of Greater London in conditions of monopoly and competition, focusing on a statically priced ATNC service that offers a mix of private and shared ride services. Public transport is considered as an alternative mode of transportation in both scenarios. Results indicate that in monopoly, dynamic pricing provides higher revenues than static pricing at non-peak hours when average waiting times are low. On the contrary, in competition, dynamic pricing is superior at peak hours where increased waiting times are observed, thus increasing the value of low waiting time rides. Overall, in both market structures, it is found that shared trips are more popular in dynamic pricing compared to static pricing.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569227","Shared Autonomous Vehicles;Public Transport;Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation","Pricing;Vehicle dynamics;Mathematical model;Vehicles;Environmental engineering;Monopoly;Databases","monopoly;pricing;public transport","public transport;competition condition;monopoly condition;agent-based model;autonomous TNC;autonomous vehicles;operating costs;transportation network companies;one-sided autonomous ride-sourcing markets;dynamic pricing;statically priced ATNC service;utility-based dynamic pricing;one-sided markets","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Field operational test results from real world multi-line bus system and rail transit system indicate that the proposed IDTO can effectively improve the success rate of transfers and reduce the commuters' waiting time during transfer.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569231","","Vehicle dynamics;Real-time systems;Rails;Vehicles;Systems architecture;Optimization;Databases","public transport;railways;rapid transit systems;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","bus transit;integrated dynamic transit operation system;service frequency;IDTO system;on-demand transit;rail rapid transit;multimodal public transit;suburban transit agencies;multimodal suburban transit;rail transit system;dynamic inter-stop trip times;dynamic bus holding control strategy;T-CONNECT capability;dynamic travel management;transfer connection protection;real-time travel needs","","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We deal with a railway network at the scale of a large national railway. With a route longer than 50,000 Km, a weekly schedule with several tens of thousands in passenger trains and many more freight trains with thousands of control points, such large scale railway problems pose a grand computational challenge for finding an optimal schedule. We present two flexible heuristics based on a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) formulation for local optimization to improve infrastructure utilization. These methods provide flexibility in scheduling new trains with varying speed and delays at each section line on the route. The two methods provide a robust solution with hundreds of trains being scheduled over a portion of the railway network yielding 100% improvement in throughput. We additionally present methods, based on linear programming to validate this nominal schedule over global correlated variations in travel times (satisfying linear constraints) without making any probabilistic assumptions. The global validity, based on linear programming, takes the order of a few minutes for a portion of the network, and is computationally efficient to handle the entire network.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569410","Railway traffic management;optimization;railway network;train scheduling","Rail transportation;Schedules;Optimal scheduling;Processor scheduling;Genetic algorithms;Delays","integer programming;linear programming;railways;scheduling","conflict-free schedule;national railway;passenger trains;freight trains;optimal schedule;local optimization;linear programming;mixed integer program formulation;large scale railway problems;infrastructure utilization;operational constraints;TTP;railway network;train timetabling problem","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An effective quantitative evaluation method for the transportation network efficiency is important as it can provide a feedback mechanism of network operation conditions in the process of network design, which gives a theoretical basis for the optimization of urban transportation network. In general, a well-designed transportation network should be adapted to multi-typed traffic demands by considering their characteristics after reconstructing. Thus, on the choice of an effective quantitative evaluation method for the transportation network efficiency, this paper proposes a bi-level programming model with the objective of maximizing transportation network efficiency in mixed network design, which has two lower users' equilibrium models corresponding to two kinds of traffic demands. A hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Frank-Wolfe Algorithm is then developed to solve the proposed problem. Results of the case study show that the network designed by the proposed model a) results in a more rational distribution of traffic flow, b) improves the adaptability of the transportation network and alleviates the traffic congestion, and c) economizes on the use of land, providing a solid foundation for the sustainable development of transportation network.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569983","traffic modeling;transportation network efficiency;mixed network design;multi-typed traffic demands;bi-level programming;genetic algorithm","Roads;Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Programming;Sociology;Statistics","genetic algorithms;network theory (graphs);road traffic;sustainable development;transportation","transportation network efficiency;efficiency-based mixed network design considering multityped traffic demands;effective quantitative evaluation method;network operation conditions;urban transportation network;bi-level programming model;hybrid genetic algorithm;GA;Frank-Wolfe algorithm;traffic flow;traffic congestion;sustainable development","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Space, financial and environmental constraints do not allow for significant infrastructure expansion. Therefore, optimizing the efficiency of the infrastructure is becoming increasingly important. Wait time at traffic lights is a significant proportion of time spent travelling within cities. Time inefficiency of traffic lights is, therefore, a global concern. Adaptive traffic signal controllers aim to provide demand-responsive strategies to minimize motorists' delay and achieve higher throughputs at signalized intersections. With the advent of new sensory technologies and more intelligent control methods, we propose an adaptive traffic signal controller able to receive un-prepossessed high-dimensional sensory information and self-learn to minimize the intersection delay. We use (1) deep neural networks to operate directly on detailed sensory inputs and feed it into (2) a continuous reinforcement learning based optimal control agent. The integration of the two is known as deep reinforcement learning or deep learning for short. Using deep learning, we achieve two goals: (1) eliminate the need for handcrafting a feature extraction process such as determining queue lengths for instance, which is challenging and location specific, and (2) achieve better performance and faster training time compared to conventional discrete reinforcement learning approaches.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569549","Deep Reinforcement Learning;Reinforcement Learning;Traffic Signal Control","Urban areas;Delays;Aerospace electronics;Traffic control;Space vehicles;Adaptation models","feature extraction;intelligent control;learning (artificial intelligence);optimal control;road traffic control;transportation","deep neural networks;deep reinforcement learning;optimal control agent;high-dimensional sensory information;intelligent control methods;signalized intersections;adaptive traffic signal controller;traffic lights;significant infrastructure expansion;environmental constraints;adaptive traffic signal control;conventional discrete reinforcement learning approaches","","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to improve coordination between taxis and passengers with a view to decrease passenger waiting time and to increase taxi profits, we propose a taxi selection algorithm (TSA) as well as a hotspot recommendation approach (HRA). While the proposed TSA achieves its objective through distributed coordination among the participating taxis and passengers, the HRA uses a clustering approach over a large-scale taxi dataset to pin-point hotspots. The main contribution of this paper lies in extensive experimentation using large-scale taxi dataset of SFO to show that the TSA outperforms existing taxi selection algorithms by finding a taxi which can reach the passenger in minimum time with up to 97.59% accuracy.

However, already small errors in sensor data measurement and interpretation can lead to severe accidents, thus, testing the reliability of sensors and safety systems before market introduction is of high importance. The downside of real-world testing is that the increasing complexity of safety systems results in increased test effort and, as a consequence, longer development time. To counteract, simulation have to play a central role in future development and test of automated driving functions. It is common knowledge that adverse weather conditions such as rain degrade a sensor's performance due to absorption and scattering by water particles in the air. As a result, the effects of rain on sensor raw data can lead to incorrect environmental perception. This behavior is highly random but still needs to be replicated in the simulation environment to enable virtual tests with a high degree of realism. This work gives an overview on the related work, rain physics, and basic sensor theory. Further, we present a novel approach for simulating the effects of rain on data from camera, Iidar, and radar sensors.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569907","","Rain;Cameras;Laser radar;Data models;Automotive engineering;Atmospheric modeling","optical radar;rain;remote sensing by laser beam;road safety;sensor fusion;sensors","adverse weather conditions;sensor raw data;rain physics;radar sensors;rain effects;sensor theory;water particles;camera;Iidar;sensor data measurement;intelligent vehicles;automotive surround sensor data","","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a reaction to this, we provide a conceptual framework which allows for the definition of operational situations and operational strategies as a way to respond to these situations. Responses may involve automatically triggered reactive measures, rule-based strategies, and AI-controlled measures. We furthermore provide an exemplary technical solution upon which such framework may be realized. We propose to split vehicular functionality into isolated services which may be replicated individually and moved between the vehicle's onboard system and the cloud at run-time, depending on situational demand. Connectivity between vehicular and cloud-based services is provided by virtual overlay networks and a publish-subscribe middleware. Finally, we provide benchmarks as a means to evaluate the proposed technical realization. We find that our approach is indeed feasible and performs well.

In this paper, a timetable optimization model is proposed to pair the accelerating and breaking trains in the operation to enhance the utilization of RBE. The main objective of the model proposed is to provide maximum total overlapping time between breaking and accelerating periods of trains by adjusting the timetable. In comparison with the existing methods, the proposed timetable optimization model requires less modeling information and calculates more train in cooperation.

One method to increase the detection performance is to fuse the raw data signal with neural networks that learn robust features from multiple inputs. Nevertheless noise due to adverse weather is complex, and in addition, automotive sensors fail asymmetrically. Neural networks that perform feature level sensor fusion can be particularly vulnerable if one sensor is corrupted by noise outside the training data distribution compared to decision level fusion. The reason for this is that no built-in mathematical mechanism prevents noise in one sensor channel from corrupting the overall network even though other sensor channels may provide high-quality data. We propose a simple data augmentation scheme that shows a neural network may be able to ignore data from underperforming sensors even though it has never seen that data during training. One can summarize this as a learned “OR” operation at fusion stage. This learned operation is also generally applicable to other noise-types not present during training.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569911","","Neural networks;Training;Laser radar;Cameras;Sensor fusion;Feature extraction","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;sensor fusion","data distribution;data augmentation scheme;data fusing neural networks;data signal;mathematical mechanism;OR operation;noise-types;sensor channel;decision level fusion;feature level sensor fusion;automotive sensors;robust features;detection performance;autonomous driving;adverse weather conditions;unknown noise","","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The article compares two different LiDARs (Ibeo Lux and Velodyne PUCK), which both use the 905 nm wavelengths, which are used in more than 95% of currently available LiDARs. The performance was tested and estimated in stabilized fog conditions at Cerema fog chamber facilities. This provides a good basis for repeating the same validation procedure multiple times and ensuring the right development decisions. However, performance of the LiDARs suffers when the weather conditions become adverse and visibility range decreases. A 50% reduction in target detection performance was observed over the exhaustive tests. Therefore, changing to higher wavelengths (1550 nm) was considered using redesigned “pre-prototype LiDAR”. The preliminary results indicate that there is no reason to not use 1550 nm wavelength, which due to eye safety regulations gives an opportunity to use 20 times more power compared to the traditional 905 nm. In order to clarify the expected benefits, additional feasibility studies are still needed.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569624","","Laser radar;Rain;Roads;Optical sensors;Optical scattering;Wavelength measurement","fog;object detection;optical radar;road vehicle radar","Cerema fog chamber facilities;weather conditions;target detection performance;exhaustive tests;automotive LiDAR performance verification;Velodyne PUCK","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While deep learning methods have come a long way providing accurate semantic segmentation of scenes, they are still limited to pixel-wise outputs and do not naturally support high-level reasoning and planning methods that are required for complex road manoeuvres. In contrast, we introduce a hierarchical, graph-based representation, called scene graph, which is reconstructed from a partial, pixel-wise segmentation of an image, and which can be linked to domain knowledge and AI reasoning techniques. In this work, we use an adapted version of the Earley parser and a learnt probabilistic grammar to generate scene graphs from a set of segmented entities. Scene graphs model the structure of the road using an abstract, logical representation which allows us to link them with background knowledge. As a proof-of-concept we demonstrate how parts of a parsed scene can be inferred and classified beyond labelled examples by using domain knowledge specified in the Highway Code. By generating an interpretable representation of road scenes and linking it to background knowledge, we believe that this approach provides a vital step towards explainable and auditable models for planning and decision making in the context of autonomous driving.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569270","","Roads;Image segmentation;Semantics;Planning;Decision making;Cognition;Probabilistic logic","decision making;grammars;graph theory;image segmentation;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);traffic engineering computing","background knowledge;parsed scene;domain knowledge;interpretable representation;road scenes;decision making;autonomous driving;road layout reconstruction;partially segmented scenes;autonomous vehicles;real-world driving scenarios;deep learning methods;pixel-wise outputs;high-level reasoning;planning methods;complex road manoeuvres;graph-based representation;called scene graph;pixel-wise segmentation;AI reasoning techniques;adapted version;Earley parser;learnt probabilistic grammar;segmented entities;scene graphs model;abstract representation;logical representation","","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly focus on capturing recurrent mobility trends that relate to habitual/routine behaviour, and on exploiting short-term correlations with recent observation patterns. However, valuable information that is often available in the form of unstructured data is neglected when attempting to improve forecasting results. In this paper, we explore time-series data and textual information combinations using machine learning techniques in the context of creating a prediction model that is able to capture in real-time future stressful situations of the studied transportation system.

Connected Vehicle technologies make future signal phasing and timing (SPaT) information available to drivers. Recent research which utilized SPaT on eco-driving has verified its potential to reduce fuel consumption in simulations and controlled lab tests. In this paper, we propose an eco-driving algorithm and use realworld driving data of 609 human-driven trips undertaken in Ann Arbor, MI. The proposed eco-driving method shows potential fuel savings of 40-50 % while matching human travel time. Results were formulated under the assumption that the vehicle is operating in free-flow traffic, utilizing SPaT of the two consecutive signalized intersections, and equipped with a continuously variable transmission and an internal combustion engine. For each human-driven trip recorded, the proposed method uses Dynamic Programming to determine globally optimal trajectories of three different eco-driving policies: fuel-optimal policy, time-optimal policy, and balanced eco-driving policy. Given the same initial and the final conditions as those of human-driven trips, comparisons are made to demonstrate the real-world benefits of the eco-driving policies. These results can serve as an upper bound of fuel and travel time saving potential of the eco-driving in the vicinity of signalized intersections.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569588","Eco-driving;eco-approach and departure (EAD);connected and automated vehicles (CAV);trajectory optimization;speed planning;traffic lights","Fuels;Roads;Vehicles;Engines;Acceleration;Optimization;Vehicle dynamics","dynamic programming;fuel economy;internal combustion engines;mechanical engineering computing;power transmission (mechanical);road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","future signal phasing;timing information;SPaT;fuel consumption;eco-driving algorithm;human-driven trip;eco-driving method;potential fuel savings;human travel time;consecutive signalized intersections;fuel-optimal policy;time-optimal policy;balanced eco-driving policy;unnecessary braking;connected vehicle technologies","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this position paper, we hypothesise that important changes torwards a more efficient use of the transport network start with its users and their behavioural changes. To this end, we introduce our vision on how to employ data driven, intelligent agent-based modelling, incorporating human factors aspects, as a toolset to understand travellers and to stimulate behavioural changes. The aim is to achieve better balanced and integrated mobility usage within the transport network. The idea is explored with a few guided questions, and a methodology is proposed. We employ 1) cognitive work analysis to investigate the reasons for travellers' mode choice; 2) computational intelligence to extract and represent knowledge from related datasets; 3) agent-based modelling to represent the real-world and to observe both individual and emergent behaviours.

The sensor outputs are used to implement decision and control modules. Verification of AD is a challenging task and requires collecting data from at least hundreds of millions of autonomously driven miles. We are therefore interested in virtual verification methods that simulate interesting and relevant situations, so that many scenarios can be tested in parallel. Realistic simulations require accurate sensor models, and in this paper we propose a probabilistic model based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) for modelling the sequential data produced by the sensors used in ADAS and AD. Moreover, we propose an efficient way to estimate parameters that scales well to big data sets.

However, the prediction of pavement deterioration is complicated and uncertain because there are many unobservable variables, and the highly accurate prediction of deterioration is difficult. For pavement administrators to use such predictions in decision making, it is necessary to quantify the reliability of prediction. This paper proposes a prediction interval estimation method by applying the bootstrap method with a reduced computational cost to the deterioration prediction model using a neural network. The proposed method is applied to the rutting depth prediction in the inspection history of road pavement surface, and the estimation accuracy of the prediction interval is verified. In the prediction model, because the inspection history is time-series data, a recurrent neural network model that extends neural networks to time series prediction is used. Verification shows that not only is the computational cost reduced but also the accuracy of the prediction interval is higher than that of the conventional method.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569337","","Computational modeling;Predictive models;Estimation;Computational efficiency;Artificial neural networks;Gaussian distribution;Maintenance engineering","construction industry;decision making;inspection;maintenance engineering;recurrent neural nets;roads;statistical analysis;time series","time series prediction;uncertainty quantification;road pavement deterioration;pavement management system;road administrator;decision making;deterioration prediction model;rutting depth prediction;recurrent neural network model;inspection;cost reduction;nonparametric prediction interval estimation method;bootstrap method","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To ensure this, hardware and software must be verified in as many driving situations as possible. This paper presents a holistic approach for testing VANET devices and the applications running on them in a Hardware in the Loop (HIL) environment. The network simulation tool OMNeT ++ and the VANET model Artery have been employed to achieve this goal.

Limited studies were conducted for driver behavior analysis on ramp-related areas due to limited data. The advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies, such as connected-vehicles, are helpful to reduce driver behavior fault. However, considering the numerous ramps in the road network in the United States, priority of ITS deployment needs to be given to those sites with a high risk of having driver behavior fault. This paper analyzed the role of driver behavior fault in crashes/near-crashes on ramp-related areas with the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data. A total of 428 crash/near-crash records and 100 baseline events (normal driving) were extracted from the database. It is found that driver behavior fault is the most important factor in the occurrence of crashes/near-crashes on ramp-related areas. Driver distraction is the most common types of driver behavior faults leading to crash/near-crash. The influence of different factors on driver behavior fault was also examined. Gender and Level of Service (LOS) were found highly related to unsafe driver behavior. Female drivers were more likely to have unsafe driver behavior at ramp-related areas. The LOS did not impact driver behavior significantly until the traffic was congested. It is recommended to initially deploy connected-vehicle devices at the sites with heavy traffic volume.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569985","","Vehicles;Computer crashes;Vehicle crash testing;Roads;Data collection;Traffic control;Safety","behavioural sciences computing;driver information systems;gender issues;intelligent transportation systems;road accidents;road safety;road traffic;roads","ramp-related near-crashes;ramp-related crashes;driver behavior fault analysis;SHRP 2 naturalistic driving study data;strategic highway research program 2 naturalistic driving study data;intelligent transportation systems;ITS;United States;level of service;gender","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering surrounding vehicles, two types of uncertainties occur: multiple future maneuvers are possible, and within these maneuvers the vehicle can vary from the predicted ideal maneuver path. Focusing on only one of these uncertainties can either lead to neglecting potential risks or result in overly conservative motion planning. Here, we suggest a Stochastic Model Predictive Control strategy that tackles the possibility of multiple future maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, while also considering uncertainty within the execution of these predicted maneuvers. The proposed control method is a combination of Scenario Model Predictive Control to cope with multiple predicted maneuvers of other vehicles, and Stochastic Model Predictive Control using chance-constraints to take into account vehicle deviations from the predicted maneuver trajectories of the respective maneuver. Adjustable risk parameters permit a violation of safety constraints up to a desired probability, allowing a trade-off between risk and performance.

This paper presents an approach to optimize the way of finding a free spot, while saving in-vehicle and walking time for the user. A park spot routing (PSR) algorithm, using on-street parking information, is presented and evaluated. It is based on the A* algorithm, a shortest path algorithm developed from the Dijkstra algorithm. The A* algorithm has the advantage that it can easily be adapted and implemented. For the PSR the cost function and heuristic of the A* is adapted so that it takes the travel time on a road segment, the expected walking distance and the parking probability into account. Simulation results in the city of Munich and Cologne showed that the PSR can help the driver to find a free on-street parking spot in a very efficient way, which makes random cruising for a free spot unnecessary. Finally, a short outlook on possible further developments will be given.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569376","","Vehicles;Legged locomotion;Urban areas;Roads;Heuristic algorithms;Routing;Cost function","geographic information systems;mobile computing;probability;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;traffic information systems","travel time;expected walking distance;parking probability;on-street parking spot;free spot unnecessary;park spot route;A* algorithm;free parking spot;crowded cities;on-street parking lot;in-vehicle;walking time;on-street parking information;shortest path algorithm;Dijkstra algorithm;PSR algorithm","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The size of the problem and the time required to solve it are affected by the number of routing alternatives available to each train. The real-time train routing selection problem (rtTRSP) chooses a feasible routing subset for each train to use as input for the rtRTMP. Recently, a computational analysis has been performed via Ant Colony Optimization and the RECIFE-MILP solver. This paper generalizes such analysis by considering a different rtRTMP model, objective function and solution approach. We adopt the AGLIBRARY solver, which is based an alternative graph model of the problem and minimizes the maximum consecutive delay. The aim is to develop real-time disturbance response strategies and to quantify the advantages of the selection of a subset of routings when using different solvers. We analyze how changes in the rtRTMP model are reflected in the rtTRSP and which modifications are required. The computational analysis is performed on two French infrastructures: the line around the city of Rouen and the Lille terminal station area. The analysis shows that solving the rtTRSP helps both solvers significantly, even if they are based on different models, objectives and algorithms.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569555","Public Transport;Train Rescheduling;Ant Colony Optimization;Mixed-Integer Linear Programming","Routing;Delays;Real-time systems;Computational modeling;Rail transportation;Analytical models;Linear programming","graph theory;integer programming;linear programming;rail traffic;railway engineering","rtRTMP model;ant colony optimization;real-time disturbance response strategies;alternative graph model;AGLIBRARY solver;solution approach;objective function;RECIFE-MILP solver;computational analysis;feasible routing subset;rtTRSP;real-time train routing selection problem;routing alternatives;traffic disturbances;time-overlapping conflicting track requests;real-time railway traffic management problem;train routing selection methods","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Primarily, the optimization model is established with the crucial objectives of energy consumption and trip time of each section. Then a two-stage approach is designed to solve the problem. First the quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) is implemented in order to find the optimal Pareto set of each section quickly and efficiently, and the corresponding Pareto curve can be obtained by fitting. In the second stage, the optimal trip time of each section and optimal operation strategy can be acquired based on internal penalty function (IPF).

The algorithms will become efficient if we could decompose the complex driving tasks into motion primitives which represent the elementary compositions of driving skills. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to segment unlabeled trajectory data into a library of motion primitives. By applying a probabilistic inference based on an iterative Expectation-Maximization algorithm, our method segments the collected trajectories while learning a set of motion primitives represented by the dynamic movement primitives. The proposed method utilizes the mutual dependencies between the segmentation and representation of motion primitives and the driving-specific based initial segmentation. By utilizing this mutual dependency and the initial condition, this paper presents how we can enhance the performance of both the segmentation and the motion primitive library establishment. We also evaluate the applicability of the primitive representation method to imitation learning and motion planning algorithms. The model is trained and validated by using the driving data collected from the Beijing Institute of Technology intelligent vehicle platform.

These, in some circumstances, are very restrictive, curbing the recognition of nuances in the survey population, hence limiting our models. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), now opens avenues for extraction of open-ended responses. In this paper, we analyze the potential of LDA in open-ended responses, by comparing with closed-ended counterpart options. A questionnaire designed based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), is used to collect information on the intentions to use shared autonomous mobility. Two versions of the questionnaire were used, that alternately allow for open- and closed-ended versions of the same questions. Factor analysis was used to construct factors from the Likert scale questions and LDA was used to extract information from open-ended questions. Ordered Probit models were estimated to predict the intention to use shared autonomous mobility services. Attitudes, socio-demographics and current travel behavior of individuals were used in the model. The questionnaire instrument played an important decision in an individual's decision to use the proposed service. Comparable results were obtained for the two versions of the questionnaire, which emphasizes the need for further research on use of open-ended questions in measuring attitudes.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569380","Autonomous Mobility;Theory of Planned Behavior;Likert Scales;Open-ended Responses;Topic Modelling;Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Estimation;Analytical models;Principal component analysis;Environmental factors;Autonomous vehicles;Resource management","text analysis;travel industry","open-ended responses;Likert scale questions;automated text analysis;travel surveys;closed-ended responses;LDA;latent Dirichlet allocation;theory of planned behavior;TPB;ordered probit models;autonomous mobility service;socio-demographics","","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when depending on highly accurate map data, every small change in the environment has to be detected and the corresponding map section needs to be updated. As an alternative, we propose an approach which is able to provide map-relative lane-level localization without the restraint of requiring extensive sensor equipment, neither for generating the maps, nor for aligning map to sensor data. It uses freely available crowdsourced map data which is enhanced and stored in a graph-based relational local dynamic map (R-LDM). Based on rough position estimation, provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS or Galileo, we align visual information with map data that is dynamically queried from the R-LDM. This is done by comparing virtual 3D views (so-called candidates), created from projected map data, with lane geometry data, extracted from the image of a front facing camera. More specifically, we extract explicit lane marking information from the real-world view using a lane-detection algorithm that fits lane markings to a curvilinear model. The position correction relative to the initial guess is determined by best match search of the virtual view that fits best the processed real-world view.

The proposed system views the entire arterial link as a number of sublinks, each functioning as a pseudo detector, and the time-varying bus-GPS information within each pseudo detector as moving sensors. One can then apply convenient algorithms to process such data, and produce the temporal and spatial traffic conditions over the link. Since bus GPS data contain the route number information, the data map matching process can be more efficient and more reliable to be applied in real-time operation. It also enables the proposed system to yield the movement-specific link speed information that can be used to estimate travel time by route and by movement at an intersection and for traffic agencies to design of signal progression for both through and turning movements.

Secure communication concerns are becoming more prevalent with the increasing technology usage in transportation systems. One of the major objectives in VANET is maintaining the availability of the system. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most popular attack types aiming at the availability of system. We consider the timely detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks to RSU in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). A novel framework for detecting and mitigating low-rate DDoS attacks in ITS based on nonparametric statistical anomaly detection is proposed. Dealing with low-rate DDoS attacks is challenging since they can bypass traditional data filtering techniques while threatening the RSU availability due to their highly distributed nature. Extensive simulation results are presented for a real road scenario with the help of the SUMO traffic simulation software. The results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms two parametric methods for timely detection based on the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) test, as well as the traditional data filtering approach in terms of average detection delay and false alarm rate.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569698","","Computer crime;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Roads;Anomaly detection;Safety;Accidents","computer network security;intelligent transportation systems;vehicular ad hoc networks","secure communication concerns;VANET;Intelligent Transportation Systems;nonparametric statistical anomaly detection;RSU availability;average detection delay;vehicular network;ad-hoc network;communication infrastructure;road side units;Distributed Denial of Service attack;low-rate DDoS attacks;real-time detection;DDoS attacks;data filtering techniques;cumulative sum test;CUSUM test;SUMO traffic simulation software","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The calibration targets are transformed from the world into the vehicle reference system according to the estimated vehicle state. Then, the calibration between the radar and the vehicle frame is split into two phases, alignment and translation estimation. The alignment is based on the trajectory described by the calibration targets when the vehicle is moving, and the translation is based on position differences when is standing.

The mobility-on-demand systems have been proposed as an alternative to a private car. Such systems consist of a fleet of vehicles that the user of the system can hail for one-way point-to-point trips. These systems employ large-scale vehicle sharing, i.e., one vehicle can be used by several people during one day and consequently, the fleet size and the parking space requirements can be reduced, but, at the cost of a non-negligible increase in vehicles miles driven in the system. The miles driven in the system can be reduced by ridesharing, where several people traveling in a similar direction are matched and travel in one vehicle. We quantify the potential of ridesharing in a hypothetical mobility-on-demand system designed to serve all trips that are currently realized by private car in the city of Prague. Our results show that by employing a ridesharing strategy that guarantees travel time prolongation of no more than 10 minutes, the average occupancy of a vehicle will increase to 2.7 passengers. Consequently, the number of vehicle miles traveled will decrease to 35% of the amount in the MoD system without ridesharing and to 60% of the amount in the present state.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569451","","Roads;Urban areas;Automobiles;Public transportation;Mathematical model;Load modeling","automobiles;electric vehicles;power engineering computing;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing;transportation","mobility-on-demand system;densely populated-cities;private car;road capacity requirements;parking space requirements;vehicle miles;MoD system;ridesharing impact strategy;personal transportation;Prague;large-scale vehicle sharing","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then we propose a DMPC algorithm for train regulation in metro loop lines, in which each train decides its control input by optimizing a local cost function subject to operational constraints.

The constant p model exhibits unrealistic platoon dispersion behavior, and a wide range of saturation flow rates. The variable p model achieves more realistic platoon dispersion and exhibits a more reasonable range of saturation flow rates. The rate of increase in p is found to be an important parameter for calibration in the variable p model, impacting both saturation flow and platoon dispersion.

In addition, we may not want to notify other people which object we are looking for, e.g., a car thief waiting to steal a car when the driver opens the door. Our proposed system allows a user to find an object without notifying others of the target, using a light attached to the target object which turns on and off in conjunction with user's operation of a remote control device, while lights on the other objects turn on and off randomly. We experimentally evaluated the system, in both virtual and real-world environments, and verified that SecretSign enabled users to quickly find their target objects without revealing the target to observers.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569518","","Observers;Color;Automobiles;Timing;Object recognition;Keyboards","interactive systems;telecontrol","interactive system;remote control device;off-line target object;SecretSign","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes an approach adapting a multi-object tracking system to model interaction between vehicles, and the current road geometry. Therefore, the prediction step of a Labeled Multi-Bernoulli filter is extended to facilitate modeling interaction between objects using the Intelligent Driver Model.

Synthetic datasets are commonly used but they have limitations. For instance, they do not capture the extensive variability in the appearance of objects like vehicles present in real datasets. There is also a domain shift while performing inference on natural images illustrated by many attempts to handle the domain adaptation explicitly. In this work, we explore an alternate approach of training using sparse LiDAR data as ground truth for depth estimation for fisheye camera.

This statement holds especially for driving on a highway. Functions such as lane keeping assistance rely on a proper representation of the lanes from the perception subsystem. To achieve such a proper representation, information from various sensors such as cameras, LiDARs, radars, HD maps are taken into consideration. Up to now HD map information has been mainly used for longitudinal control, e.g. in cases when there are speed limits or curves ahead. Using map information for lateral control is more difficult, as the quality of the information derived from the map heavily depends on the precision of the positional and heading information of the ego vehicle. Uncertainty in the ego vehicle position and pose directly results in uncertainty in the line information retrieved from the digital map. We examine the influence of an uncertain Gaussian ego position and pose for the resulting map line information which is not necessarily Gaussian. In order to transport the map line information to other subsystems such as the lane fusion module, we need to approximate the map line distribution by a suitable data structure which is both accurate and compact. We discuss and evaluate suitable approximations of the resulting map line distributions such as mean values of map lines only, mean values combined with standard deviation values and mean values combined with the full covariance matrices. We show that the usage of mean values and covariance matrices approximate the true distributions rather accurately, and therefore are both from an accuracy point of view and from a bandwidth point of view the way to represent map lines in interfaces.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569378","interfaces;uncertainty;lane fusion;lane detection;lanes in HD maps","Automobiles;Uncertainty;Autonomous vehicles;Sensors;Cameras;Covariance matrices;Roads","cameras;control engineering computing;covariance matrices;driver information systems;Gaussian processes;information retrieval;mobile robots;object detection;optical radar;position control;road vehicles;sensor fusion;traffic engineering computing","map line interface;autonomously driving vehicle;HD map information;speed limits;lateral control;lane fusion module;mean values;heading information;vehicle position;covariance matrices;ADAS perception system;gaussian ego position;information retrieval;data structure;bandwidth point;positional information;cameras;LiDARs;sensors information","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, beyond simple lane markings, real-time detection and interpretation of road markings is challenging as images are subject to occlusions, partial observations, lighting changes and differing weather conditions. Additionally, there is high variation in the road markings between countries and regions, which makes interpretation difficult. In this work we present a three-fold approach to the semantic classification. Firstly, we employ a weakly supervised neural network to detect pixels belonging to road markings under different conditions. Subsequently, these pixels are classified into geometric primitives, from which we retrieve the semantic classes through a fast and parallel model-fitting algorithm that offers real-time performance. Unlike other methods in the literature that perform road marking classification independently, our proposed approach performs a joint classification leveraging the highly structured configurations that characterise urban traffic scenes. Consequently, we retrieve the underlying semantic classes under a variety of weather and lighting conditions as we demonstrate in our results.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569382","","Roads;Semantics;Lighting;Optimization;Real-time systems;Image segmentation;Meteorology","geometry;image classification;neural nets;object detection;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","semantic classification;geometric primitives;road markings;safety critical task;simple lane markings","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional fixed bus line planning and vehicle scheduling are difficult to meet the needs of the public due to the real-time changes in passenger flow. Opening new flexible bus lines during special periods becomes an effective measure to ease the pressure. The traditional method for designing new bus lines mainly rely on human experience and field investigations, which are both non-scalable and incomplete. The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data technologies have provided us with new opportunities.

The algorithm selectively records the expert's corrective driving behavior during data collection. This is performed recording oscillatory driving behavior when the vehicle is returning to the center of the lane. This data augmentation method addresses the issue of covariate shift commonly found in behavioral cloning methods. This approach is computationally inexpensive, making it a viable option for real time embedded deployment. A feasibility study was performed with two remotely controlled scaled vehicles as a proof of concept. Results showed that when two expert drivers demonstrated overtaking behaviors for data collection, even a small dataset was sufficient to model the overtaking sequence. The overtaking maneuvers were deployed in real time on 1/8th scale RC platforms, validating OP-CAS for civilian vehicle safety applications.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569740","Advanced Vehicle Safety Systems;Autonomous Vehicles;Convolutional Neural Networks","Collision avoidance;Autonomous vehicles;Trajectory;Neural networks;Computational modeling;Real-time systems;Hardware","cameras;collision avoidance;mobile robots;remotely operated vehicles;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;robot vision;traffic engineering computing","behavioral cloning methods;remotely controlled scaled vehicles;data collection;overtaking sequence;overtaking maneuvers;OP-CAS;civilian vehicle safety applications;collision avoidance system;autonomous vehicles;behavioral cloning-based approach;low cost monocular camera;oscillatory driving behavior;data augmentation method;collision avoidance systems;overtaking procedure","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Monte Carlo simulation based approach which utilizes well-known sensor models in a probabilistic manner to model the interaction between traffic participants is presented. Besides uncertainty in maneuver decisions, the maneuver execution is modeled with a probabilistic model learned from realworld data. Furthermore, the problem of limited information is addressed by a combination of the interaction-aware model with a maneuver classification algorithm providing information on the short-term maneuver.

In this paper, we present a Natural Language Pro-cessing-inspired approach, entitled Bag-of-Label-Words (BoLW), for analyzing image data sets using exclusively textual labels. The BoLW model represents the data in a conventional matrix form, enabling data compression and decomposition techniques, while preserving semantic interpretability. We apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model to decompose the label data into a small number of semantic topics. To illustrate our approach, we use freeway camera images collected from the Boston area between December 2017-January 2018. We analyze the cameras' sensitivity to weather events; identify temporal traffic patterns; and analyze the impact of infrequent events, such as the winter holidays and the “bomb cyclone” winter storm.

In this paper, we propose to use 3-D recurrent neural networks (RNN) to extract rich spatial context information of different resolutions to improve the accuracy of pedestrian detection. Recurrent neural networks have been shown to improve the performance for many tasks like speech recognition by exploiting the dependency between inputs at different time steps. However, the chain structure in conventional RNN is not very suitable for 2-D image tasks. The proposed 3-D RNN has a multi-path structure that enables the context aggregation between not only the neighboring cells but also feature map of different resolutions and abstraction levels. The context extracted in this way is rich because both the spatial dependency on the same feature map and the information across different feature maps are taken into account. By combining the 3-D RNN with skip-pooling, this method can detect multi-scale pedestrians under complex driving scenarios. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed method has a competitive performance, with an average precision of 73.04% on KITTI dataset, and a miss rate of 9.31% on Caltech dataset.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569807","","Feature extraction;Convolution;Recurrent neural networks;Object detection;Data mining;Proposals;Spatial resolution","driver information systems;image resolution;object detection;pedestrians;recurrent neural nets;stereo image processing","multiscale spatial context features;pedestrian detection;autonomous driving scene;pedestrian scales;3D recurrent neural networks;3D RNN;skip-pooling","","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such prediction should be probabilistic, to address the uncertainties in human behavior. Such prediction should also be interactive, since the distribution over all possible trajectories of the predicted vehicle depends not only on historical information, but also on future plans of other vehicles that interact with it. To achieve such interaction-aware predictions, we propose a probabilistic prediction approach based on hierarchical inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). First, we explicitly consider the hierarchical trajectory-generation process of human drivers involving both discrete and continuous driving decisions. Based on this, the distribution over all future trajectories of the predicted vehicle is formulated as a mixture of distributions partitioned by the discrete decisions. Then we apply IRL hierarchically to learn the distributions from real human demonstrations. A case study for the ramp-merging driving scenario is provided. The quantitative results show that the proposed approach can accurately predict both the discrete driving decisions such as yield or pass as well as the continuous trajectories.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569453","","Trajectory;Vehicles;Probabilistic logic;Probability distribution;Predictive models;Roads","learning (artificial intelligence);road safety;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","interactive driving behavior;hierarchical inverse reinforcement learning;autonomous vehicles;road participants;human behavior;possible trajectories;predicted vehicle;future plans;interaction-aware predictions;probabilistic prediction approach;hierarchical trajectory-generation process;discrete driving decisions;continuous driving decisions;future trajectories;IRL hierarchically;continuous trajectories;AV","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking on-road driving for example, self-driving vehicles are supposed to behave in a human-like way to decide when to keep the lane and when to change the lane. This point, however, has not been well addressed in current on-road maneuver decision methods. In this paper, a human-like maneuver decision method based on Long Short Term Memory (LST-M) neural network and Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is proposed for on-road self-driving. Different from previous works, this paper considers the maneuver decision problem as a sequence labeling problem. Its input is a time-series vector which describes a period of neighboring traffic history, and its output is a one-hot vector indicates the suitable maneuver. The proposed model is trained on the NGSIM public dataset, which contains millions of driving maneuvers collected from thousands of human drivers.

Prognostic and health management (PHM) technique can reduce the risks of equipment due to its powerful ability of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. However, RUL prediction for RPS is a challenging task due to the difficulty of identifying the state for each operating phase related with specific failure modes (FMs) and constructing a comprehensive degradation state from the selected features. To cope with this challenge, this study presents a novel framework for the RUL prediction of RPS. Specifically, a segmentation approach of the power signals is first proposed by constructing an optimization model, in order to identify the FM-related operating phases. Then, a construction method of the health index (HI) is put forward to obtain the comprehensive degradation information by fusing the selected features, which indicate the partial information of the degradation state, and are extracted with popular approaches of feature extraction. Next, the RUL prediction model is developed based on the constructed HIs. Final, this framework is evaluated using the monitoring data of RPS collected from China Railway Guangzhou Group.

However, due to the limitation on the driving range per charge, an EB may need to get recharged several times during its daily operation. Therefore, the operation of regular charging EB requires trip schedules together with proper charging plans, which specify the charging time and electricity amount to ensure satisfied service performance. In this paper, a neighborhood search based heuristic considering charging and dispatching policies was developed for scheduling the regular charging EB on city bus routes. The algorithm was tested on a real bus route in Shenzhen, China. With the objective of minimizing the annualized total cost, the algorithm provided optimized operation schedule. The cost-benefit analysis revealed that a trade off between the fixed cost and the charging cost should be made to decide on the fleet size. The availability of the charging facility at depots has a great impact on the annual cost.

These traffic-responsive frameworks implicitly prioritize transit vehicles over cars due to their higher passenger occupancies while considering conflicts that might exist between transit vehicles arriving from conflicting approaches. However, previous person-based signal timing optimizations consider only fixed phase sequences, which limits their flexibility. This paper extends previously developed algorithms to consider phase rotation in which phase sequences may change within each cycle. The phase rotation is directly incorporated in the mathematical programming framework, but could also be accommodated using an enumeration approach for computational efficiency. The proposed signal timing optimization is tested using numerical simulations of an intersection in State College, PA. The results reveal that phase rotation can reduce overall passenger delay through significantly cutting down bus passenger delay while slightly increasing car passenger delay. However, the performance is sensitive to the assumption made in optimization about phase sequence in future cycles. Assuming a background sequence, rather than an optimized sequence in the current cycle, for future generally results in less frequent phase rotation actions. Such a practice can better maintain a pre-assigned background phase sequence but limits the reduction in passenger delays at the intersection.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569671","person-based signal timing optimization;real-time signal control;phase rotation","Delays;Automobiles;Optimization;Real-time systems;Discharges (electric);Linear programming","delays;mathematical programming;road traffic control;transportation","transit vehicles;mathematical programming framework;bus passenger delay;car passenger delay;total passenger delay;traffic-responsive frameworks;phase rotation;person-based traffic signal timing optimization framework;preassigned background phase sequence","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an analysis of tourist destination choices with longitudinal travel data collected from Twitter. From a collection of geo-tagged tweets, we have filtered out a reliable sample and identified tourists using a data mining approach. Then we find the tourists' destinations inside Florida. We have created a sequence of visited locations and applied a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model to predict the type of a tourists' next destination. The proposed model utilizes the features extracted from tweet posted time and location types. The feature set can be expanded by incorporating content-based features without violating the assumptions of CRF.

This shortest path metric does not consider collision with obstacles. The result can serve as a heuristic to solve path planning problems for autonomous vehicles, especially for parking and pull-out scenarios, where a vehicle needs to drive from a reference line to a given final pose or vice versa.

In this work, we address both of these challenges as a single probabilistic estimator. First, we treat the grid map estimation process as a multi-channel tracking mechanism. In particular, we use a particle filter based solution to integrate both the occupancy and semantic grids. Second, we adapt the idea of simultaneous grid cell tracking and object shape estimation into the grid map domain and propose “self-localizing tracklets”, which are individual particle filter based estimators that are used for two main tasks: stabilizing the position estimation accuracy of dynamic cells with respect to the object boundary, and estimating a better object shape.

Results showed that, when using PPU or BT+HUD, the minimum throttle opening, the steering wheel angle (SWA) and the Shannon entropy (SE) of SWA were all greater than those values when using BT+AUD or None. As for the SE of throttle opening and all the examined eye movement features (frequency and duration of fixation/saccade), the values when using BT+AUD or BT+HUD were higher than the values when using PPU or None.

Baluja","Google Research","2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","","2018","","","3205","3211","Machine learning-based optimization of traffic light programs has been successfully employed to reduce emissions and traffic delays. Due to the variability of traffic flows, it is common practice to optimize multiple traffic light programs tailored for specific conditions and deploy them at predetermined times of the day or days of the week. We explore an alternative to this manual set-interval methodology. We create a system to automatically select the appropriate light controller program in response to continuously changing conditions. We analyze the current traffic density and close-time traffic patterns and instantiate the correct pre-optimized light program based on current conditions. Rather than creating a small set of programs tailored for specific periods of the day, we automatically create, and select from, an over-complete set of light controllers. Based on historic observations, a combination of machine learning approaches are used to find the best representative set of traffic flows to model the system.

One promising way to tackle this problem is through parking availability prediction. In this paper four algorithms for on-street parking prediction are described, analyzed and compared using real data. The first one uses only the availability's historical mean and standard deviation with no assumption on its distribution. The second assumes that availability is normally distributed. The third uses real-time information and models the availability variation as a normal random variable. The fourth also uses real-time information but models vehicle arrivals and departures as non-homogeneous Poisson processes. This comparative analysis supports the following: use of real-time parking availability information improves prediction performance, classification metrics are necessary for proper algorithm evaluation, and predicting arrivals and departures independently leads to fewer false positive recommendations at the cost of more false negatives.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569921","","Random variables;Prediction algorithms;Real-time systems;Vehicles;Biological system modeling;Urban areas;Sensors","data analysis;normal distribution;pattern classification;prediction theory;random processes;road traffic;stochastic processes;traffic information systems","classification metrics;nonhomogeneous Poisson processes;vehicle arrivals;random variable;real-time information;real-time data;on-street parking prediction;parking availability prediction;traffic congestion","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed framework utilizes a modified genetic algorithm to identify (near) optimal signal phase and timing plans that minimizes total vehicle delay at an isolated intersection. The phasing plans are completely flexible in terms of phase sequence and duration and thus the algorithm can respond well to changes in prevailing traffic conditions. The proposed algorithm is tested in a simulation environment and compared to an enumeration approach that has been previously used to solve a similar problem. The results show that significant efficiencies can be achieved in computational effort (over 95% shorter duration to obtain final signal timings) without sacrificing car delays (less than 1% increase in car delays) compared to the enumeration approach. Furthermore, the computation time required to run the algorithm can be set a priori by simply modifying the parameters of the genetic algorithm, which allows the proposed algorithm to be scalable with respect to the total input flow and the penetration ratio of connected vehicles while still being capable of running in realtime.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569312","connected vehicles;traffic signal control;genetic algorithm","Biological cells;Genetic algorithms;Delays;Automobiles;Optimization;Discharges (electric)","genetic algorithms;road traffic control;road vehicles","vehicle delay;computation time;car delays;final signal timings;computational effort;traffic conditions;phase sequence;phasing plans;timing plans;optimal signal phase;modified genetic algorithm;connected vehicles;scalable traffic signal control algorithm","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One underlying reason is the operation strategy of the battery pack. To reduce aging and avoid deep discharge, state of the art battery management employs strict and conservative operational limits, leaving a significant amount of energy in the battery unused, directly translating into a loss of possible range. Additionally, this strategy leads to a sudden and, for the driver unpredictable, power derating at a low state-of-charge (SOC). This paper proposes an approach for defining the operational limits of the vehicle's battery and a strategy for using most of the available capacity and power at a low SOC, increasing the vehicle's capabilities with no additional hardware. The benefits of this approach are shown by a theoretical assessment of selected BEVs. The limitations of current implementations are analyzed by an experimental study of a Volkswagen e-Golf on a chassis dynamometer and under real driving conditions. The impact of an extension of the battery's operational limits is discussed with a study of relevant literature and supported by measurements of lithium-ion battery behavior. The strategies presented in this paper are implemented, simulated and evaluated under consideration of the behavior of a single cell within the battery pack, as well as the whole electric drivetrain.","2153-0017;2153-0009","978-1-7281-0323-5978-1-7281-0321-1978-1-7281-0322-8978-1-7281-0324","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8569455","","Batteries;State of charge;Battery charge measurement;Electric potential;Resistance;Voltage measurement;Aging","battery management systems;battery powered vehicles;secondary cells","lithium-ion battery behavior;battery pack;electric drivetrain;range extension;improved battery capacity utilization;operation strategy;operational limits;power derating;low SOC;battery electric vehicles;battery management;low state-of-charge;selected BEV;Volkswagen e-Golf","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
