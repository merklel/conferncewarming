Many of these systems use proprietary information-communication-control-technologies (ICCT), among others, and for that reason it is difficult to integrate them into new industrial environments that require Industrie 4.0-compliances. The migration process of such industrial systems, i.e., retrofitting it into an Industrie 4.0-compliant, ICPS-Infrastructure, leads to the necessity of new features and components in the legacy architecture. This paper summarizes the process for retrofitting a flexible manufacturing system located at the Institute for Industrial Informatics, Automation and Robotics (I<sup>2</sup>AR) of the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, integrating legacy PLCs, RFID and commercial cloud technology on the basis of an Industry 4.0-compliant digitalization of components with OPC UA interfaces. With the use of common technologies recommended for migrating legacy industrial systems into Industrie 4.0-compliant systems, the authors describe the major specifications and characteristics of a migration approach and resulted novel ICPS-architecture that allows the operator and/or other legacy automation and management systems to monitor and control the PLC component via a RAMI4.0-compliant digital interface, via a retrofitted RFID System.",,978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532,10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387646,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387646,OPC UA;Azure;Cloud Computing;Industrie 4.0;RFID;Industrial Digitalization;RAMI4.0;ICPS Architecture,Industries;Cloud computing;Radiofrequency identification;Servers;Automation;Computer architecture;Manufacturing,cloud computing;control engineering computing;flexible manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;programmable controllers;radiofrequency identification;software maintenance,industrial environments;Industrie 4.0-compliances;migration process;ICPS-Infrastructure;legacy architecture;flexible manufacturing system;Industrial Informatics;commercial cloud technology;OPC UA interface;migrating legacy industrial systems;novel ICPS-architecture;operator;management systems;RAMI4.0-compliant digital interface;retrofitted RFID System;legacy PLC-based automation systems;Azure cloud;retrofitted RFID system;legacy systems;production processes;proprietary information-communication-control-technologies,,2,23,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Due to the need in the industry, this paper presents a calibration method to resolve the absolute accuracy of robot TCP movement in a limited workspace problem. We implement this low-cost method with camera tracking which in a much lower cost fashion than general purpose laser tracking device. We use Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) method based on deep neural network (DNN) which can be more efficient than traditional empirical compensation method in improving the error offset calculation and calibration accuracy. In addition, the justification for selecting training data, the methods for designing DNN models and the schemes for improving DNN models are also described in details.",,978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532,10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390743,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390743,cyber-physical systems;calibration;camera tracking;deep neural network,Calibration;Cameras;Robot vision systems;Robot kinematics;Service robots;Probes,calibration;industrial robots;neural nets;neurocontrollers;object tracking,absolute accuracy;industrial robot;iCPS applications;industrial cyber-physical systems;self-control improvements;calibration method;robot TCP movement;low-cost method;camera tracking;general purpose laser tracking device;Rectified Linear Unit method;calibration accuracy;low cost solution;DNN models,,2,26,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Coriolis Mass flow meters are used widely throughout industry, but commonly only for single-phase fluids, i.e. either liquids or gases, since accuracy is degraded by gas/liquid flows. The provision of robust measurement in non-ideal conditions is an increasingly important requirement. Here we propose that a modified Matrix Pencil Method is able to track the modes of flowtube vibration excited by gas/liquid flow, and show the results of applying the technique to numerically simulated data.",,978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532,10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8390745,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390745,Industrial cyber-physical systems;measurement validation;oil and gas;Coriolis mass flow meter;signal processing;matrix pencil method;two-phase flow,Signal processing;Sensors;Vibrations;Matrix decomposition;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Fluid flow measurement;Robustness,Coriolis force;flow control;flow measurement;flowmeters;numerical analysis;pipe flow;pipes;two-phase flow;vibrations,measurement validation;measurement quality;fault conditions;single-phase fluids;nonideal conditions;ICPS;Industrial Cyber-Physical System instrumentation;gas-liquid flow;liquid-gas flow;modified matrix pencil method;coriolis metering;Coriolis mass flow meters;flow tube vibration;numerical simulation,,1,27,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

A cyber-manufacturing system (CMS), which is generated from ICPS, poses significant challenges on reliability, accuracy and responsiveness of computation services for manufacturing decision making. In this paper, we focus on reliability and responsiveness. Due to the heterogeneities of the computation and communication capacities and conditions, demanding computation services may not be completed in a timely manner. To facilitate reliable and responsive computation services, we propose a deadline constrained predictive offloading method based on a mobile-fog-cloud (MFC) network. This method optimizes the offloading decisions by solving a quadratically constrained integer linear programming constrained by latency requirements and predicted availability of devices. A newly constructed hybrid cyber-additive manufacturing network is used to test the performance of the proposed predictive offloading method and the MFC network. The results show that the proposed method outperforms mobile computing, fog computing, cloud computing, and fog-cloud computing benchmarks to minimize resource consumption and comply with latency requirements.",,978-1-5386-6531-2978-1-5386-6530-5978-1-5386-6532,10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387654,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387654,computation offloading;fog computing;cloud computing;industrial cyber-physical systems;smart manufacturing,Handheld computers;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Cyber-physical systems;Smart manufacturing;Iterative closest point algorithm,cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;decision making;integer programming;linear programming;manufacturing systems;mobile computing;production engineering computing,mobile computing;fog-cloud computing benchmarks;industrial cyber-physical system;ICPS;physical processes;computation resources;reliable computation services;responsive computation services;reliability;communication capacities;predictive offloading method;mobile-fog-cloud network;offloading decisions;newly constructed hybrid cyber-additive manufacturing network;mobile-fog-cloud enabled cyber-manufacturing system,,1,37,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
