New Words Discovery Method Based On Word Segmentation Result,H. Liu; P. Gao; Y. Xiao,"School of Computer Science, Communication University of China, Beijing, China; Laboratory of Media Audio & Video, Communication University of China, Beijing, China; School of Computer Science, Communication University of China, Beijing, China",2018 IEEE/ACIS 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS),,2018,,,645,648,"A kind of new words discovery method based on word segmentation result is presented in this paper. Word segmentation is an important part of many Chinese Natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Improving the accuracy of Chinese word segmentation is a matter of great concern. With the increasing number of web text, more and more Chinese NLP tasks need to use micro-blog, movie review and other web text. The content of web text changes very fast and often contains a large number of new words. It is an important factor affecting the accuracy of word segmentation that word segmentation tools can not identify these new words. One way to solve this problem is to discover new words in the text to use and add these new words to the dictionaries on which the word segmentation tool depends. The traditional method of new words discovery can only find the words that do not exist in word segmentation tool's dictionary. But these words do not necessarily affect the result of the word segmentation. That is, the words may be correctly segmented even if they are not added to the word segmentation tool's dictionary. To address this issue, we propose to build a collection of candidate new words based on segmentation result. All the new words discovered in this way segmented by the word segmentation tool by mistake. Adding these new words to the word segmentation tool's dictionary can improve the accuracy of the word segmentation more than traditional methods. Experiments on the DouBan movie review dataset show that our method can get better new words to improve the accuracy on movie review sentiment classification.",,978-1-5386-5892-5978-1-5386-5893,10.1109/ICIS.2018.8466490,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466490,new words discovery;word segmentation;sentiment classification,Dictionaries;Motion pictures;Tools;Manuals;Natural language processing;Text categorization;Task analysis,data mining;natural language processing;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis;Web sites,new words discovery method;word segmentation result;Chinese word segmentation;word segmentation tool;Chinese Natural language processing tasks;NLP;DouBan movie review dataset;movie review sentiment classification,,,6,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,

The DNN in the training stage calculates the magnitude spectrums of noise-free speech and the noise signals, respectively from the input noise-masked speech features concurrently. The Less aggressive Wiener filter is then placed as an extra layer on top of the deep neural network to create the enhanced magnitude spectrum.

However, HDFS has good performance for accessing large files, but it is very inefficient for small files such as music source files and music metadata. In view of this, this paper proposes a geared to the needs of mass music based on HDFS small file access optimization scheme, using the format of the music data classification, build multistage merger queue, merging small files into large files in order to reduce the number of files, and create an indexing mechanism to access small files.

Feature code matching is commonly used for network intrusion detection in network defense. Even though the feature library can be updated constantly, the linkage between invasion features are not fully considered in the traditional matching algorithms. The lack of dynamic analysis of invasion form reduces the accuracy of attack classification and network threat detection. In order to solve this problem, dynamic detection method of network intrusion features based on a poor fuzzy localization algorithm is proposed. By establishing and analyzing the network intrusion feature set, the new algorithm uses poor dynamic feature matching algorithm to correct the disadvantages caused by fuzzy features maximally. In the matching process, fewer invasion feature points are used for subsequent multiple matching, which can shorten the matching time and eliminate matching errors.

However, the categorical features must be handled before building decision tree model. There are various discretization techniques used to transfer continuous-value data into discrete-value data. It is difficult to select the appropriate discretization algorithms for different characteristics of data sets. In the experiments, we consider the class sample proportion to separate data sets with numerical attributes into two groups and apply with 12 commonly used discretization methods. We study both supervised versus unsupervised and top-down versus bottom-up approaches including ChiMerge, MDLP, Chi2, FUSINTER, Modified Chi2, CAIM, Extended Chi2, MODL, CACC, Ameva, PKID and ZDISC. The experimental results show that the MDLP, which uses class information entropy, is the best overall performance for Decision Tree, especially for different class sample proportion data sets. The CACC, which uses the contingency coefficient criterion, is the best algorithm for similar class sample proportion data sets.

In turn, this often robs away one's regular walking habit. However, increased awareness towards one's fitness and ill-effects of sedentary lifestyle have encouraged individuals to monitor their daily physical exercise such as, walking. The quantitative assessment of one's gait (manner of walking), requires an objective and reliable technique that can be used as a part and parcel of one's daily living. State-of-the-art technologies for quantification of one's gait, such as stereophotogrammetric systems, floor mats, etc. though accurate, often suffer from issues related to portability, affordability and setup complexity. This necessitates the use of light-weight, portable, affordable and user-friendly wearable devices for monitoring one's gait. Here, we have designed a pair of cost-effective, portable and user-friendly Sensored Shoe that can offer quantification of one's gait-related indices such as, stride length, step length, %stance, %swing and symmetry index. Further, we have validated some of the gait-related indices measured by the Sensored Shoe with that measured using the standard method, namely, paper-based setup.

However, the current approaches for clustering trajectory data generally do not apply for excessive costs in both scalability and computing performance for spatiotemporal big data. To find the clusters of moving objects' trajectories, the issue is to find a distance measurement method that respects the geographic distance and the semantic similarity for each trajectory. Therefore, a distance measure to compute the spatial similarity between trajectories based on both geographical features and semantic features of motion is proposed in this research, then a framework for clustering moving objects trajectories is also designed to find out the groups of similar paths from big spatiotemporal data.

A Trust Model for Lightweight Semantic Annotation of Sensor Data in Pervasive Environment,N. Karthik; V.

Due to recent advancements of sensors and wireless technologies, pervasive computing is bringing heterogeneous sensors into our everyday life for providing better services. Data collected from heterogeneous sensors and raising number of sensor node manufacturers leads to data heterogeneity problem in pervasive computing applications. The generated data from various sensors depict more conflict in types, formats and representations which arises problem for nodes to process and infer. Because of data heterogeneity, the data cannot be shared with other application which leads to interoperability problem among pervasive environment. To overcome this, Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) are used for semantic annotation of sensor data. Annotating the sensor data with SWT is an important process in making interoperable pervasive applications. Due to resource restriction, harsh and open environments, data generated from sensor network suffers from noisy, faulty data and missing data. Annotating the faulty data with SWT causes unwanted resource consumption, network traffic and affects application performance. To solve these problems, a trust model is proposed to remove noisy, faulty data and reconstruct the missing data. Trust model ensures the annotation process of trustworthy sensor data alone and reduces resource consumption. In order to find the efficiency of proposed approach, we carried out a set of experimentation on medical sensor network prototype of pervasive healthcare application.

But people with hearing and speech impairment whose primary means of communication is sign language and hand gestures, find it difficult at times to interact with others who are not privy with this language thus resulting in a communication gap. The fact is sign language is fundamentally different from English or any other spoken language. There are different forms of gestures like hand gestures, which include one or two hands, facial expressions, body or other subtle movements. Also, hand gestures are of two different types: static and dynamic gestures. A static gesture refers to some hand pose and configuration, represented by a single image while a dynamic gesture refers to a moving gesture, represented by a sequence of images. Due to the complexity of dynamic gestures, most researches in this domain are focused either on static gestures/postures, or small sets of dynamic gestures. To this end, this paper aims at developing a Sign Language Recognition system which can interpret and translate dynamic sign languages to their equivalent texts, to help the hearing-impaired communicate with the hearing society conveniently, thereby diminishing the communication barrier.",,978-1-5386-5892-5978-1-5386-5893,10.1109/ICIS.2018.8466546,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466546,Sign Language Recognition;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);Inception Model;TensorFlow;Transfer Learning;OpenCV,Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Feature extraction;Videos;Sensors;Cameras;Auditory system,gesture recognition;handicapped aids;sign language recognition,dynamic gesture;static gestures/postures;dynamic sign languages;hand gestures;spoken language;static gesture;sign language recognition system;realtime sign language translation;hearing speech impairment,,,14,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,

In this paper, we classify tomato plant disease using two different features: texture and color. For a texture feature, we extract statistical texture information (shape, scale and location) of an image from Scale invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature. As a main contribution, a new approach is introduced to model the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) texture feature by Johnson SB distribution for statistical texture information of an image. The moment method is used to estimate the parameters of Johnson SB distribution. The mathematical representation of SIFT feature is matrix representation and too complex to be applied in image classification. Therefore, we propose a new statistical feature to represent the image in few numbers of dimensions. For a color feature, we extract statistical color information of an image from RGB color channel. The color statistics feature is the combination of mean, standard deviation and moments from degree three to five for each RGB color channel.

A fundamental requirement for solving this problem is to provide proper levels of security based on the requirements of cloud customers and sensitivity of data. However, generating these security levels only partially serves the requirements of cloud customers especially if it's not linked to the management of SLC commitments. Accordingly, a novel approach has been proposed in this paper to define and manage security indicators in the generated security levels. These indicators are used to react to eventualities that may threaten the established mechanisms of the generated security rings, to ensure the fulfillment of agreed assurance levels, and to minimize the damages in case of attacks, unpredictable events or unavoidable changes. The proposed schema uses simultaneous monitoring with two different stand-alone agents per security level.

But this feature opens a gate for the attacker to access the cache and determine recent cache access pattern. An attacker can probe request and determine if the received content is cached or not by observing time difference between the request and data received. Previous solutions try to apply delay whenever the data is accessed from the cache. These approaches mitigate attack but compromise NDN performance. To overcome this issue, we have proposed a counter scheme in which the gateway router detects attack pattern and applies countermeasure. Our approach applies delay on data accessed from the cache, only when the attack is detected. We have compared our approach with the approach in which random delay is applied every time on cache hit.

This paper proposed emotion recognition of three basic emotions of elders, such as happy, sad and angry based on those physiological signals. Window size segmentation that was used to extract both physiological signals was 15 second. Then, statistical feature extraction method was used to obtain the features of SpO<sub>2</sub>and Pulse Rate (PR). Support Vector Machine (SVM) with selecting the best of C and γ parameters and the most optimal K parameters of k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) method were used to classify the extracted features which were tested in several scenarios: classification using SpO<sub>2</sub>, using PR and using SpO<sub>2</sub>-PR features. The result showed that SVM achieved the best accuracy (72.86%) and precision (71.30%) compared to k-NN. Furthermore, combining the features of both physiological signals could improve the accuracy and precision scores more than 3.70% compared to the single physiological signal.

This kind of monitoring can be accomplished by detecting and identifying the explosions. If an illegal explosion happens such as quarry blast, an alarm should be reported to the government to take immediate action. However, the main problem is that many measured signals from received explosions are similar to earthquakes in their shape and both cannot differentiate from each other. Also, incorrect classification possibly will distort the real seismicity nature of the region. This problem motivates us to search for unique discriminating features to distinguish between earthquakes and explosions with precise accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to extract the discriminative features based on Autoencoder from the first few seconds after the P-wave arrival time of the event. The discriminative features are found to be in the first 60 samples after the arrival time of P-wave. Thus the first stage of the proposed algorithm is extracting the discriminative features via the Autoencoder. Then, softmax classifies the event based on these extracted features. The proposed algorithm achieves a classification accuracy of 98.55% when applied to 900 earthquakes and quarry blasts waveforms recorded by Egyptian National Seismic Network (ENSN).",,978-1-5386-5892-5978-1-5386-5893,10.1109/ICIS.2018.8466464,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466464,Earthquakes;Explosions;Deep Learning;Autoencoder;Automatic Classification,,earthquakes;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;seismic waves;seismology,feature extraction;autoencoder;received explosions;immediate action;quarry blast;illegal explosion;human life;automatic classification;quarry blasts waveforms;P-wave arrival time;discriminative features;earthquakes;unique discriminating features,,1,19,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,

Our objective is helping software developers and testers to predict error-prone classes, eliminate design defects and reduce testing costs. In learning-based methods, the dataset that is used for training the model, strongly affects the accuracy of the detection system. Therefore, we focus on steps of constructing the proper dataset using different metrics collected from existing software projects. First, we consider the rate of errors generated by a class to label it as ""Clean"" or ""Buggy"". Secondly, we use CFS (Correlation-based Feature Selection) and the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) methods to obtain the most appropriate subset of metrics. This feature selection process increases the understandability and the detection performance of the model. Lastly, we apply the Random Forest classification method to determine error-prone classes. We evaluated our approach using five different datasets that include data collected from various open-source Eclipse subprojects.

The nutrient rich lands help us providing year-round crop yields that play a crucial role for the economy of Bangladesh. Thus, this is important to deliberately work on agricultural planning and prediction models to ensure economic prosperity. The advancement of crop yields is significantly dependent on soil factors like Ph, nutrients and organic substances along with climatic factors like rainfall, temperature and humidity. Data of such factors are recorded to serve the purpose of scientific and statistical analysis. With the help of applying different data mining techniques on them, we are able to determine effective parameters to predict crop yield from different locations. This paper mainly focuses on the analysis to predict Bangladesh's four most yielding crops; wheat, jute, T-Aman and mustard. To carry out the whole experiment, we have analyzed soil properties of medium high land and high land from different sub districts of Bangladesh and also their respective climatic data and crop production of the last 6 years.

Background noises on the binary images are removed by four filtering features such as color threshold based filtering, aspect ratio based filtering, boundary based filtering and region area based filtering. After removing the noise, line segmentation and character segmentation are done. Horizontal projection profile is used for line segmentation and vertical projection profile and bounding box methods are used to segment the characters. These connected component characters are recognized by using 4×4 blocks based pixel density and total chain codes, 4-rows based pixel density, 4-columns based pixel density and count of eight directions chain code on the whole character image and on each block of character image.

In the CCN, every single router has cache storage to store requested contents, and uses it as a key feature to improve overall performance. Routers store all received content, until cache replacement occurs. Therefore, an attacker can infer the activity of the user connected to the access router by using the round-trip time (RTT). In this paper, we introduce a popularity-based caching strategy, PPNDN, which has been designed to prevent cache privacy violation, without compromising network performance. The popularity was measured once by the content provider at the time of creation, and kept updated by local NDN routers based on demands by local users. Adjusting cache period based on the demand makes it immune to cache privacy violation, and at the same time sustains optimal network performance. The analysis confirmed by simulation results shows that PPNDN has the lowest cache period without degrading performance, compared to other cache policies.",,978-1-5386-5892-5978-1-5386-5893,10.1109/ICIS.2018.8466482,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466482,named data networking (NDN);cache privacy;timing attack;content popularity;cache policy,Privacy;Delays;Internet;Cooperative caching;Data privacy;Computer architecture;Cache storage,cache storage;computer network security;data privacy;Internet,PPNDN;privacy preserving;CCN;network architecture;cache storage;cache replacement;access router;round-trip time;popularity-based caching strategy;cache privacy violation;content provider;local NDN routers;cache policies;named data networking;Internet architecture;cache period,,,10,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,
